tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tablet. Didn't need the 4G connectivity. Great resolution. Nice and compact. Would recomend to anyone who is looking to for a good tablet at a good price. It very well made.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tablet I've personally owned, (but I have used many IPads). I own the Tab2 7.0. I purchased mine from Best Buy during Black Friday weekend for $179.00 :) So what a deal! I love it. Fast response time all-around, online, through apps, etc. Beautiful screen/video quality. I highly recommend this tab... ONLY thing is if the 10 inch was on sale also for a good price, I probably would have gone with that, but the 7.0 is perfectly fine, very pleased.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this Tab wanting something really not as expensive as an iPAD but that can be functional and let me view webpages, have some nice apps and be small enought to carry around. I also wanted a GPS enabled tablet so I can use an app to drive around instead of carrying a Garmin device, so far I have found a company KaartData that makes apps for Latin America and other countries so this will be perfect for me.I work with GIS and I will also be using the tab to collect data, overall I am impressed with how easy it is to set up and all the functions it has, it comes with ICS android and it is really fast. I am loving my tab

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had my galaxy tab for at least a month, and I have no complaints. The screen is amazing for watching movies and TV shows. Also the battery life a substantial, I have been able to go full days with this device in one charge. It has been able to do any and everything I throw at it. I definitely would recommend this tab to anyone who is looking for their first tablet or replacing an Apple.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|firstly is a great tablet, fast internet, games, sound good, and the battery life is amazing.if you wanna a great tablet and cheap, i recomend you the samsung galaxy tab 2 7.0just what i looked for.5 stars definetly

tablet_galaxy_tab|I originally had the apple ipad2 and loved it, but had to sell it. I have been looking for a replacement tablet that still offered great features but was a portion of the price. Granted you do get what you pay for. When I was playing around with the different tablets, I did my research and decided to go with the Samsung Galaxy S2 tablet. I love it. The screens display is great, it instanly syncs with your gmail acount, you can start downloading apps the second you turn it on, 8gb memory, read ebooks, browse online,wifi, play games and so much more. The screen however is too small for me. I do wish I would have gone with the larger screen. Either way, the samsung tablets are way less than the apple ipads. You getexactly what you pay for. The samsung tablet is well worth the price. I do suggest spending the extra money for the larger 10 inch galaxy s2 tablet. Its worth it. I actually gave my smaller one to my brother and got the larger one for myself. The screen is larger, more memory,wireless, bluetooth and gps capable.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007M50PTM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007M50PTM&linkCode=as2&tag=amazon070f-20

tablet_galaxy_tab|Excellent tablet good for play, video chat, listen to music, to stay in social networks.To work also goodThe brand samsung excellent.But the hard drive capacity is a poor capacityShould have an Galaxy tab 2 7.0 16gbThe wifi and bluetooth work very well
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've had the Galaxy Tab 2 for a few months now and I keep finding more uses for it. Beautiful, responsive screen. Arrived before the expected date. I am very pleased with my experience dealing with Amazon.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this tablet for my daughter five years old. She loved it. It met our expectations and is functional.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm not one who usually does reviews but this one I couldn't overlook. I love this tablet!! It is small enough to fit almost anywhere but big enough to play games on or search the net ( and be able to read it ). It doesn't have a flash for the camera which is the only down side to this device, I'm sure I'll live. The aps are great, they run smooth and everything is pretty easy to find on it. Overall would rate the Samsung 2 7.0 at a solid 4.75 stars out of 5.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|good price and great features, a best option compared with other tabs in the same line; great to gaming and normal internet use.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this tablet for my son for Christmas. He has not put it down. It performs very well, and is easily worth what I paid for it. Very happy with the purchase.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great tablet and easy to use. I use it for shopping, web surfing, email, bill pay etc. I bought a 32 gig micro sd to expand the 8 gb memory. Its really nice. Good price and the perfect size.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is one handy gadget should've bought one much sooner. This tablet to me is just the right size not too bulky and it is very light. I strongly reccommend this...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I like it it has been nice since I got it works like a charm ^^ everything I hoped for!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tablet and no regrets buying it. Even though it comes with only 8mb memory, for someone starting out it is the right tablet. It is easy to use and understandOptions are good especially the Available Apps and upgradable to 32 mb
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet gives my I-Pad a run for the money. Not to say it also runs Adobe, which I-Pad doesn't. I'm lovin it and I'm getting another for my wife...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|anyone looking for a tablet to play apps or just your basic user then I would say spend the 500 plus on a limited Ipad, but if your looking for something that is amazingly cheap, has a lot more options than just downloading apps to play with your buddies than this is your product. It is perfect for a person like me who is a full time student and worker, who is going to school for information tech. this open source system with the endless amounts of possibilities has totally blew my mind. Never did I think I could afford a tablet with this many options which is too many to list. My must have in tablets and phones these days is the option to have sd or micro sd card and still Im shocked how many types of tablets don't offer that. This tablet can play your movies, games, roms, and has the potential to develop your own app or write source code( something I'm doing in school). The only thing that I didn't check was that was only wifi so newbies like me you need a good hotspot or internet connection. I would recommend getting 4g lite and wifi that is the only problem I have found so far. love this product
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|WONDERFUL! Simply a joy to have! Save your money, buy this instead of an I pad! Lots of apps and games. My wife LOVES the Polaris Office app. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is a tool we use everyday for many things. Best electronics purchase I have ever made. Ease of use and lightening fast! Great for Ebay, PayPal, all the social networks etc. Can't find a fault yet!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It works every bit as good as a iPad. She is able to do her school reports on it and download to a flash drive. I could not be more satisfied. It was a bargain.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this as a gift for my 8 yr old son.. He absolutely love it.. It performs great.. It has just the right amount of storage for the games and music he has downloaded.. It was shipped to me in 2 days.. :)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased the Galaxy Tab 2 to replace a Nook Color. I've had it a couple of weeks now, and I couldn't be happier. I use it 98% as an e-reader, though I do occasionally do some light web surfing and/ or playing games or videos.The battery life has been acceptable, though when in a high light environment (i.e. outside) or with heavy wifi use the battery life does suffer.I would recommend ordering a case at the same time you order the tablet, as I didn't do so, and while I was waiting for my case to come in I dropped my tablet. Of course it landed face down on the concrete on my front porch. You guessed it, I now have a crack in the glass on the face. If I had the case I believe I would've been able to avoid the crack.It's a good alternative to an e-reader, and now that the price has dropped, it's cheaper than the Nook HD and probably the Kindle as well.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 has been a very worthwhile purchase. It durable, lightweight and performs the tasks needed for Android very smoothly. I was quiet surprised with how loud the speakers got.My two your old uses it often and it has survived her very well. Other than the screen needing to be cleaned frequently, it has survived a lot of falls with out showing any signs of damage.The battery life is what you would expect from a tablet this size. It does offer a power saving option for the longer trips.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love my Galaxy 2 7 inch tab! I did buy the refurbished version and had to send the first one back to Big Outlet. Big Outlet took forever to send out a new one, about 3 weeks. I was not happy with them at all! I had to file the A-Z Guarantee before I got it sent back to me and they over-nighted it after I filed against them. I wish I had known to file sooner.The replacement tablet has worked great! I bought it to replace my Kindle Fire (original version) and wow does it ever beat it! I really liked my old Fire but this is hands down the better choice. It is faster and has so many more features. I love that I can add the mini SD card for more room. I highly recommend the Galaxy Tab 2.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|In the family, we have iPads, kindles, and now these. I like it better than the kindle, and is probably on par with the iPad, but haven't messed with it enough to really enjoy it. Battery life is plenty long, and has a nice big plug in for ease of use
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|All and all this is a great product.....While its not the expensive 10inch model with all the bell and whistles, for the price, it can't be beat. It does everything I need it to do, when I need to do it. Plays games, gets emails, surfs the web...etc etc etc...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|highly recommend, my daughter is so happy. And she was so surprised and has not set it down i think she slept with it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The price was excellent. amazon came through with best pricing as usual and fast shipping. All the stores were sold out.Kids were able to use them right out of the box. I bought the case that has a blue tooth keyboard and they are loving them. !6 and 18 year olds are hard to please but they loved them.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|For the Price , i paid 179.99 . Its the best for that price range. One thing for people to be aware of is that even though is says 8gb , you really get around 4gb free , so it would be wise to buy a memory card if you are going so put alot of music and videos on it. The infrared remote is a plus, i can control my TV and Cable box with it. It comes with ICS out of the box , the jelly bean update has not been released for this version yet, although other countries have received it already.Honestly i really cant complain, i knew what i was buying before i got it, and it lived up to my expectations.UPDATE - 1/11/2013JELLY BEAN UPDATE HAS BEEN RELEASED (Updated via Samsung Kies Desktop software)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|So far my Samsung has been easy to set up. Good internet speed. Wireless set up was less than 1 minute to get ot the network. I did load McAfee before I started on the internet and glad that I did because I found lots of problems with free software containing virus and malware attached to them, so be careful about what you download from the internet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|DONT wast money on I pad, this thing blows all other tablets away! I cant believe the speed and clarity!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was nervous about purchasing something that had been refurbished but mine is great. I love it. Everything works perfectly on it. The screen has great touch sensitivity. Great tablet!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tab is faster than the first model which I also own the 10.1,It also has a memory card slot which the first one does not have.It plays You Tube Vids in HD with no stutter the first one has some issues with that.An all around solid performer.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought mine when it first launched and I loved it. I used it for six or so months. That's why the 5 star rating.I ended up trading it for a GSM Galaxy Nexus and buying a Nexus 7 to replace it.While I did l really enjoy this tablet I'd say now that its outdated. The Nexus 7 cost the same and is twice as fast. The rear camera has horrible quality.The SD storage is the one real plus for this tablet that the Nexus doesn't beat it at.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|works great, I love it and my daughter loves it too. She uses my Samsung Galaxy Tab all the time instead. Her tablet can not down load temple run or temple run 2 but mine does. It is small and handy, fits in my pocket book and its easy to carry. Internet Connection is good and I did not have any problems with it so far. Yes, would recommend to a friend. Was shipped faster than I thought. Thank you for the nice Tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It came a little later than expected, but it was the holidays so I understand that. On the plus side it works really well, has a great feel and weight, and I've hardly seen it since. I think it's in her hands every day, for watching something or playing/chatting and it gets charged every night. But that's hardly a complaint since that was the idea. A great gift that gets used, and enjoyed. I recommend this over a high-priced, over-hyped iproduct any day of the week. It's a lot more useful and a lot better expense.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've had an iPad, but it was rIdiculously expensive. I bought the Galaxy for half the price of the iPad mini.The camera is not very good and I'm affraid the battery capacity is not as good as I hoped.I would buy this again, though.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tablet and I love it. I debated between this, Google Nexus and Kindle Fire. It came down to getting a better price on the Samsung and it hasn't disappointed. It's compact, light and fast. I download books and games and surf the web and have no complaints at all.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Is a really good portable tab that according to your specification meets all expectations and at times exceeds them by the recent updates that have been made &#8203;&#8203;to your operating system.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This Tablet is very easy to use and very fast, I prefer this to my laptop as it is lightweight and comfortable like the size of a medium sized Bible.1) Drop box is also a helpful tool to connect your tablet with other devices, however sometimes when documents are created in Word on a regular PC/Tablet,there is sometimes an error where the entire document joins together and the alignment of the document changes.2) The Tablet doesn't take night pictures properly once there is no lighting.3) Please ensure to backup the items that are in dropbox, sometimes there seem to be some errors between the tablet and dropbox.Other than that I will recommend this to others once you are looking for a simple, useful device especially if you are a student that always needs time for reading and need something lightweight.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this and received it today. I love it.Plus: There are two cameras, front facing for chatting and rear for taking pics. Preloaded with lots of great apps. Unlike the kindle, the apps are available even in my country. May not have dolby but the speakers are great. Resolution is great and so much more. Will I recommend this product? Most definitely!Negative: Can't think of any at this time.My advice: Buy and enjoy!Update!Ok so I need to tell you guys some more about this product. There is one thing you need to know before you purchase it. You need to prepare yourself or be blown away. This product is SWEET. It is suppose to be my husband's but that lasted for a couple days, my kids hog it. My husband is not a games kinda guy but that was until he got this product. Jeez he's worse than the kids. Samsung you have a created a monster. All in all... great product. Gots to gets me one!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Being an apple family, I wasn't sure if my kids were going to like this android system. I bought two of these and my kids think they are the best thing! I was surprised that they took to them so easily and identified the pros and cons so quickly between apple and android.They would highly recommend this product as being very versatile and mobile. Would definitely buy this product again for a gift for someone else.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I use it on a daily basis to read various web-texts assigned by various teachers this quarter. It's handy on the bus or in class. I've played a few games on it, downloaded some books on kindle and browsed the internet fairly easily. There are some minor issues with loading multiple pdf's at once, but I'm still learning Android, so I should be able to fix my own problems easily enough.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|If you are thinking about getting a tablet, and not spending an arm and a leg for it, get this. The camera isn't great, but who takes pictures with a tablet? I purchased this for a family member and had to get another for myself. This thing is awesome. 5 stars.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this tablet. I barely use my laptop anymore because my tablet is so fast and there are so many apps that I can get so that I do not have to use my laptop. I am very satisfied with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. Also, the size was perfect. I thought I wanted a 10.1&#34; but I realized that after I got this tablet, it was much easier to carry around and the size is just perfect for every situation.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|excellent product! very responsive. had it for a few months and so far, no problems. I would recommend this to anyone.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|A great machine for a small price. took me a little time to figure it out, but now it is the joy of my wife.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|it has all capacities that i need. It's handle, and confortable for read books, I considerer it is a realiable tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this at the perfect time as I had to put my lap top in for repair. This is so easy to use and the picture clarity is amazing. When my Kindle is on the charger, I read with the tablet. Also loaded a few movies for travel. I so glad that I have this tablet. Samsung is a great manufacturer and I'm rapidly reaching a point where everything I own is Samsung.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It comes with the latest android version, works just great, is very fast. Camera quality not that good, lack of flash feature. Battery duration is average, is a great device! recommended 100%. Most of the apps are free. I would rather this one instead of a Mini-iPad. You don't need the 3G version if your smartphone has the hotspot feature (I can share the internet connection of my iPhone with this device with no issues)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very good product, very responsive. Beautiful screen and fast interface. The camera needs a little work and probably an update to take better pics, but this is not why we bought it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought it in BF at just $180. I works perfect, very nice appearance of ICS, fast and reliable. Highly recommended.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm actually writing this review using my tab, it has exceeded all my expectations and has become an extremely handy alternative to using a laptop (except when doing things that require a larger screen, or prolonged periods of internet browsing which can get straining after a while with a smaller device). Overall, best technology buy I've ever made at this point
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|we bought 2 and are very happy. and the price was right. would recommend it to anyone looking for an ipad equal.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Everything I want in a tablet. It's simply perfect! Very nice layout as well as the screen, it has a great display as well
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|--great product froze only one time after that no problems ; just wish it had a better camera ; other than that no complaints #aMustHave &#128077;&#128077;
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am so loving my galaxy tab. Right now my 6 year old has taken it over so I am just waiting to see what new Samsung will come out with to buy one for me..Its easy to use, as I said my son as taken it over, completely forsaking his PSP. He download his own free games, quiz, abolutely amazing.Highly recommended
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I had a Coby Kyros but it wouldn't keep a charge longer than a hour, and it wasn't fast enough for what I wanted to-do with it. I'm so happy with this tablet. The tablet is sleek and stylish without sacrificing system resources. This tablet packs a punch, runs ice cream sandwich operating system. Works like a boss!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|So far I love it. Sure there is room for improvements but all the tablets i looked at were missing something. This has expendable memory unfortunately it only works for files pics movies and music. Still better than nothing it frees some space. It has Google play and flash so you can watch videos. Nexus 7 doesn't have flash or expendable memory. This also has the 2 cameras i think, i honestly haven't used them yet. Also you can use it as an e-reader. It literally replaced my nook color. I am already happy with my buy. Although lastnight there was a sale on it for $220 then today it's back too $250 so I would watch out for a price drop. One other little gripe I have is that there isn't a mini usb port. That would have been nice. so I could buy a cheaper mini key board. But it does have Bluetooth so that's a plus. Oh and the screen smears easy but that's what screen protectors are for.So on it the plus side it's easy to navigate the touch screen is responsive, graphics are great, comes with Google play and flash. Both Barnes and Nobel and kindle work, 2 cameras, expendable memory slot, light weight, nice screen and an affordable price.I tried 2 off brands and they both didn't come close to this tablet. Those were the 7" visual image or something like that and the 10" Archos 101 internet tablet. Also I own the nook color. Wish I had known about this then.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've had the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 for a couple of weeks now and loved it from day one. I considered the iPad, but don't use an Apple (except iPod) for anything else because of the nature of my work. I've used the iPad 2 and iPad 3 owned by a relative and found it overpriced for something that's more like a toy and isn't that practical. The iPad is also embarrassingly large (it's funny watching people with these large tablets in airports). I wanted something smaller and more practical that would be compatible with the work I do every day, and the Galaxy Tab definitely fits the bill. I'm not sure I'd find the iPad mini much better.The only glitch I had was that I had to restart my router on the second day so that my wifi connection would remain stable. Haven't had any problems since. I like the fact that I can check e-mail from my own server, download, view and edit/create MS Office documents using free software, read Kindle and ePub content using free apps, organize music, books, photos, etc. into various folders on the external SD card and surf the Web easily with Chrome or the default browser. I rarely use my laptop or computer for simple tasks anymore, unless I have to use proprietary software for my work. This handy device will be great on flights. Say goodbye to paid carry-ons and hello to free personal items! :o)The system updates to 4.04, which seems to work pretty well, but I preferred the keyboard on the 4.01 version. Some people recommend the Hacker's Keyboard, but if you use one like that, beware that some data (such as credit card numbers) can be transmitted to the keyboard designer. Of course, I don't plan to make any purchases using the Tab, but it's something to think about. I initially added the German keyboard to the default US keyboard (not Hacker's version), but found it a real pain because every time I tapped the spacebar it switched keyboards instead of adding a space, so I removed it. I also turned off the autocomplete feature because it is more of a pain than helpful. Google's voice recognition is a great feature in lieu of typing, but you have to have an online connection to use it.Battery life can be extended using airplane mode and keeping the brightness setting down. I don't care for the glossy screen, so I'm getting a non-glare screen protector. Streaming Netflix and YouTube works well. I'm looking forward to trying Skype and/or Google Voice on it. Before I bought it, I wasn't sure if I would use it much, but now that I have it, I don't think I'd want to part with it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|We were told about the Samsung by a friend and we were looking for one for our 13 year old daughter. This has been perfect for her!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love it soooo much, I have been going to bed two hours later than I should every night 'cause I'm having so much fun with it. It plays every video format I have thrown at it including .MKV--on the app that comes with the device. I've put magazines and books from the library on it. I still prefer the real thing, but I do like knowing that there are 14 magazines and six books in my purse at any given moment should I find myself in need of distraction/time-killing. It does suck that it doesn't come with a manual, but nothing really does any more. I keep wondering what I am missing out on, but what I've figured out so far has been pretty great.Now I come to the reason for leaving a review. When you're looking to buy this, you might do what I did and get a 32GB micro card, a multi-format adapter, and the best case for how the tablet will be used. By all means, do just that. I did, and I don't regret it. There is one more thing to do.******BE SURE TO BUY AN ADDITIONAL DATA/SYNC CABLE!!******Seriously, get one now!! When you need one due to loss, damage, or accidentally leaving it at work over the weekend (as I have), you WILL NOT be able to readily buy one. Target doesn't have them. WalMart doesn't have them. Radio Shack will tell you when you call that they do have them, but when you arrive to purchase, you'll discover the kid on the phone had no idea what he was talking about. Then you'll remember seeing a Sprint commercial for this device, and will go there. You will point to the cable on the display tablet and tell the really nice guy trying to help you, "I need a data cable." He'll stop cold and say, "I don't think we have those." And they don't. Honestly, if the one on their display model goes out, they will have to order one from Samsung (or Amazon, of course) If you're lucky the really nice guy at Sprint will offer to lend you his for the evening. (Just throwing that in 'cause I thought it was waaay cool) You will eventually find one at the Verizon store several miles up the road. They want 30 bucks for it.So to ensure the fun continues and doesn't spiral into a weekend filled with despair, angst, and price gauging, GET ANOTHER DATA CABLE NOW!!As I am writing this, they are available on this site for less than six bucks.

tablet_galaxy_tab|The Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 (which is what I'm using to write this review) is pretty slick. Though the screen resolution isn't ideal, Samsung certainly made up for it with the sheer quality of the screen. Size and weight are perfect; not too big to be unwieldy, but big enough to be useful for getting things done (unlike my smartphone, a Samsung Epic 4G Touch).The only downside I had was with Samsung's version of Android (with TouchWiz); the stock firmware leaves a lot to be desired in terms of performance. However, a good hour or so of flashing ClockworkMod and CyanogenMod 10.1 + GAPPS fixed the tablet right up.Now I just need a screen protector, case, and keyboard, and I'll be all set.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I chose this article because it's at a great price, excellent quality and I recommend it to you.thanks you
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have the Samsung Note 10.1 which I love. Once I purchased this tablet 2 it felt like I knew exactly how it functioned. Samsung is very good with their products. Top of the line!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I can not say enough about this tablet, I dont see how it could be any better its almost supernatural. The battery life is great, I can livestream net flix for 11 hours and still have 30% left. The only think I could not do so far is to run Yahoo hearts, there may be a way but I dont know how One can not go wrong buying this product.We take alot of road trips and frequently on a motorcycle. This will eliminate taking the laptop and save space and weight and tripple my battery life. I also got the $16 poetic leather cover and a 32g SD card. The camera and video are unbelievabe too and easy to use. Unbelieveabe to me what you can get for $180.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm glad I purchase this Tab. It comes in handy when I don't want to bring my laptop with me, and have access to the internet. It's still a wonder because I'd been looking for a Tab at a lot of stores, and came right to amazon.com, and paid less for the Tab with the accessories.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tablet device. I wanted something affordable (but not from some unheard-of mystery manufacturer) and this seemed ideal. At the current Amazon price ($180) I think you'd be hard pressed to find anything better. For that kind of money I wouldn't lose too much sleep if something awful happened to it...I'd just buy a new one! It might not be as high-spec as a $500 device, but it does the job. Minor complaint is that the cord on the charger is a little short, which is a pain if the battery's dead and you need to use it while charging. My only other gripe is that a lot of TV streaming services work only in "landscape" format, with the tablet held horizontally, but the speakers are on the bottom edge, so stereo is impossible! The sound all comes out of the right hand side!! I'm sure this probably applies to most (perhaps even all) tablets, but it's a really dumb design mistake in my opinion. On a similar note, it would make sense to have the volume control reversed when using it horizontally...so that you press the left hand side to lower the volume, right hand side to raise it. Maybe someone at Samsung will read this review and take note! :-)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Galaxy Tab 2 appears to be well built and is a very nice looking Tablet. There is one big problem. It drops the WiFi signal every few seconds. When this happens, the Tablet shows a very strong signal on the screen. I tried several locations in the house with the same results. This makes it impossible to use the device. Maybe I just got a bad one. Might be something you want to check out before you buy. Amazon was great about returning the purchase.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love the tablet. I reseached the iPad and my kids have the Kindle Fire but this really surpassed the expectations. My youngest boys (7 and 9) play games on it and I can get on the web when I am stuck at an appointment. I highly recommend this tablet over the pricier iPad or the Kindle. The kindle was just too heavy, this is super light.

tablet_galaxy_tab|So after reading the reviews I decides to go for this Samsung Tablet as my Christmas girft. I may say it a great tablet for such a low price.SOUND.It has its own speakers, wich are actually grat, but whe holding horizontal, you them with the hands.CAMERA- no flash.The rear camera is only 3mp but it takes quite good pictures, though It would have been nicer if it had at least LED flash.PERFORMANCE.This tab offers a great performance, with its 1ghz processor allows you to run some of the best apps and games, though it lacks of Flash Player support, there are many tricks you can make to have Flash.SCREEN.The screen resolution is quite good, you can play HD videos, and its colors are brilliant. I LOVE IT.APPS.It runs all the Google Play apps plus the Samsung Media Hub wich allows you to watch your favorite series for free.BATTERY PERFORMANCE.The battery performance is up to 4 and a half hours, though it charges very fast (half an hour i got 75% charged.CONS. It wont charge when plugged in to a computer.In the box: Tablet, USB Cable, and the USB AC Adapter for Charging.I will recomend to buy this tablet with a Crazy On Leather Case Bundle (Great Quality for such low price), and you should get an 32GB microSD.You wont regret buying it!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this thing. It is so handy. It is quick starting up and works beautifully. The price for this little gem is very reasonable as well. It has a very nice screen and surprisingly good sound in such a small package. The only drawback I see is that it isn't, "Flash"enabled. If you want a very handy device without mortgaging your house I recommend that you try this one.Extra! Extra! : I'm editing this review to say that I found that you can get Adobe Flash by going to the bottom of the product's page here on Amazon to the customer questions section. WJ had the answer that worked for me. Here it is copied and pasted."Go to the Adobe Flash Archives:Before going to the link below make sure you go to setting, security and select or check the "unknown sources" box.[...]Scroll down and find "Flash Player for Android 4.0 archives"DownloadHope this is helpful :)WJ answered on January 1, 2013"

tablet_galaxy_tab|I love practically everything about my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2!The size, weight, function, screen clarity, etc. all meet or exceed my expectations.I used Apple devices for many years, so Android took a little getting used to, but now I feel that nearly everything that Android does differently from Apple, they have actually improved on the way Apple does it.The changes and improvements are way too numerous to list, but I like them, and I think you will too!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Galaxy Tab 2. Excelent device, good election. I recomended, so easy to use. The perfect size and weight to This Tablet. Thank you
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|have waited 3 years to buy a tab..or a pad..or a kindle...this is the one I chose and it is awesome!...read Kindle books, watch movies, play games....just don't work on it...it will take the fun away!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The device is awesome. I can now watch all the streaming videos on the internet without problems: even those adobe/flash videos that cannot be played on ipad. The speaker is loud enough to liste to the music even when I am taking a shower. The battery is ok, and in the general, the device seems to be reliable to me. Moreover: it's so cheap compared to apple product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Well worth the price. Setup just fine, well designed device for the price. 8GB is plenty for an Android device. The display is very pleasing to the eye. Also makes a great reader with the Kindle app. Highly recommend, and the prices have dropped to a level where this is the best 7" pick, a much better deal than what one would pay for an iPad mini, in my view. Like any mobile device, plug it in when you can, but should work through a full day on battery.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased one for my husband and one for my daughter for Christmas. they love them. My daughter is computer savvy and is thrilled with it. This replaces an inexpensive one she had that would not download a lot of apps. The only app we have found so far that we can't load is Adobe Flash Player, although Samsung and the description say you can. My husband who is not computer savvy will actually use this. He is learning how to get around in it and is not afraid to do so. It is fast, display is bright and battery life is very good, like 6 hours heavy use. If you are looking for a good tablet, this is the one to get. I was so happy with them, I turned around and bought one for myself. I ordered it while it was showing out of stock and would be available Dec. 30th. Amazon shipped it on Dec.22nd and it arrived Dec.24th in time for Christmas. Merry Christmas to me. Thank you Amazon, you rock.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is the greatest thing for an older person, the screen is big enough for them to use without trouble.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Fast, unlimited apps, excellent wifi connection, life battery is great, android operating system 4.0 is simple, easy and fast. Great gadget
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Samsung and Google hit a home run. I have both a 10.4 inch and a 7 inch version of this tablet. This one is the ultimate in convenience. My wife carries it in her purse and loves having it wherever she goes. Solid construction (not cheap feeling). The display is crystal clear. I've looked at a lot of apple products (iPad included) and I do not see what the apple fans see. What is so great about spending more money for an inferior product? I will continue to buy Samsung products if they continue with the same high quality.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was a Xmas present from my husband and I have fallen in love with my tablet! I really struggled with whether I should get the larger size or this 7&#34; before he bought it but I am SO happy with the smaller 7&#34; screen. It fits in my hands perfectly and isn't awkward to hold comfortably. I haven't even begun to find all the cool stuff I can do with this but everything that I've seen so far has been amazing! I think Mac and Ipads are overrated for the price! This tablet seems to do all the same and maybe more for much less $$$! Super happy with my tablet, I can take it everywhere with me! Everyone should get one!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this mainly for travel so I don't have to lug a laptop around. I don't game and mainly useIt for browsing. I like the organization aide apps and I keep my music on it. It is very responsive.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am remarkably surprised at how much this little tablet can do for the price! It is much better than I was expecting. Keep in mind that I am not an ultra-techy person... Having said that, it works well for browsing the web, email, Facebook, and I love the Android OS. I have an Driod phone and was able to install all of the apps that I use on my phone plus some extras. I selected this over the Kindle Fire due to the available Micro SD slot.My daughters both love it so much that they have asked for one for their birthdays.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Got it as a gift for my husband. Bought one with Christmas and birthday gift cards when it first came out last April. He's very happy with his as I love mine!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great performance at a very affortable price. I have never own an android platform devise and I may say that it is quite nice, with a lot of free app. So far Im very please with My purshase
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The tablet has a very fast response, nice to see v&iacute;deos or play. The position of the speakers is really good, you don't cover with your hands when you use. Good battery life. The only con: If you want to connect with a usb modem you must buy a mifi or a 3g router (Between 35 to 70 dollars).
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this for my wife about 2 weeks ago. She had been suggesting that she wanted the Kindle Fire, and I suggested she would be happier with a tablet that had a few more options. So we went with this.So far, its been a great little tablet. Battery life is good, the SD slot let me install a 32GB card which let me load up lots of pics, music, ebooks and videos. Can't think of any problems she's had since we got it. Only one thing I'd like to see changed: I'd like to remove some of the pre-installed apps that came with it. From other reviews, I could root it and get access to this, but that's just a little more work than I'd rather do, and I've read a few user reports that bricked their systems when they tried to root their devices. So I'll leave alone for right now.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have owned this tablet for several weeks and am very impressed. It is quick and the screen is very bright and clear. Battery life is excellent. The features work as advertised and it is a high quality unit. That said I ordered the Nexus 7 - in spite of the lack of SD slot. These are the reasons. I personally hate the 30 pin adapter that is needed to charge the unit. Maybe we will get HDMI from it - if Samsung ever released an adapter that will work with it. But at this point it is simply a more complicated and fragile charging/USB port and if I lose it I am SOL. Nexus 7 wisely uses standard micro USB. Next - the screen resolution on the Samsung means that you often have to move web pages sideways to activate buttons as so many sites are designed 1280 pixels wide. The Nexus 7 has 1280 resolution. It is aggravating to have to move your pages around to locate buttons. As far as storage I will buy one of those new wireless portable hard drives. Bottom line is the Samsung is GREAT, but for my needs the Nexus looks better.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Google announced Nexus 7 a couple of days after i had purchased this tablet. I was regretful initially until i did some research. A couple of reasons why Galaxy Tab 2 is still a better value for me. Nexus does not have a back camera. I would like the option of being able to snap a photo or video once in a while with this tab. Second the Nexus does not have an expandable memory slot. So no slot of a Micro SD card. If you buy 8GB tablet you cannot increase the memory. I have already expanded the memory of my Galaxy Tab with 16GB Micro SD card and i think i will need the extra memory. The Google website is also charging sales tax depending on the state in the shipping address. For the time being i am quite satisfied with my purchase.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought myself an iPad for christmas, and kept it for 3 weeks before sending it back. it was frankly not as much fun as I thought, too wide and bulky to be easily read/keep out of the way at a cafe, and in it's solar case almost as heavy as my netbook I was replacing.I needed a device that could be tethered, would be able work with dropbox and gmail as well as take decent pictures. This one does everything the iPad does, at a third the price and still has a super sharp screen and a whole lot more control. Fuctionality wise it's been easier to customize and is better suited for people who need to produce rather than consume.Working with video editing apps has been a ton easier than iPad ever was. Kindle always works smoothly. wiFi connection never kicks me off. I'm very very happy with it, most of all the size is much better suited to someone like me who has small hands. the iPad was just too big and bulky to be worth the effort.Plus, in a simple leather case, this looks like a day planner, where as a 10" tablet looks like a 10" tablet, and makes you more noticiable to those around you. This one gets no stares, and I love that.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I am a professional piano tuner/technician and I wanted something to be my "administrative assistant" as well as a tool in my toolbox. As a tuner I use specialized analysis software to verify my work and needed something portable. I got that and more. Not only can I use my software with this, but I can even use it as an accurate a440 tuning fork, if needed.When two of my children's offbrand tablets malfunctioned within the warranty period and that other manufacturer wouldnt even answer the phone, we bought two more of these samsung units to replace the offbrand units. The children love them.We use them for e-readers, using kindle app, fbreader and adobe reader. We use them for offline gps with gps copilot. We use them for educational purposes with multiple language and drawing apps. I use mine for work both as a toolset and administrative assistant.The biggest drawbacks we have found so far, other than having to use power save mode all the time and gps causing fast power drain without external power, come from android 4.1.1 and are generic to all units running this release, but are only minor issues. IIRC, samsung has already released 4.1.2 in several countries but continues to hold north america to older software. Android no longer allows for the moving of apps to the expansion card via settings and app developers have yet to "pick up the slack." On apps that can be manually modified to do so, config files have to be found and corrected and relevant folders have to be manually moved. This isnt something the average user wants to be bothered with. Jelly bean 4.1.1 seems to want to reboot on rare occasions that appear to be with moving large quantities of files, and it is difficult to remove bloatware, requiring a 3rd party app that can perform "rooted" tasks or can bypass that need. One samsung specific quirk that I don't like is the proprietary usb connection on the device. If the usb cable messes up, it will be a pain to replace it. This also limits connectability flexibility when trying to connect to devices with a micro usb slot.Pros:Dual cure processor, 1gb ram, 32gb expansionLightning fast gps tracking, bluetooth, wifiE-reader compact sizeFunctional flexibiliyEconomical priceCons:Must be run in power save mode AND airplanemode for optimal battery performanceEven with external power, the gps function will slowly drain power.Android 4.1.1 specific glitches and bloatware.Proprietary usb slot on deviceStorage limits for the technically illiterate.Summary:Great unit with just a few drawbacks that can be worked around. Biggest drawbacks are usb slot/cable, battery consumption when using gps or communications features and issues specific to android 4.1.1 that will hopefully be fixed with the eventual update. But if you tend to download a lot of apps and dont want to be bothered with manually configuring them to use the expansion sd card, then you may want a different unit with 64gb of internal storage instead. However, if this unit withstands the test of time then I will be extremely pleased.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This thing is incredible. New technology to me. I'm not much into iphone technology or ipads. I bought this for convenient access to emails and internet when traveling. Smaller than a laptop/notebook (overkill for me), larger than an iphone (easier on my eyes), travels easier than a larger tablet and more versatile than a Nook or Kindle....it was the best of all options for me.The learning curve to access and use apps continues to be interesting. I have yet to learn how to load, store and edit photos from the micro sd slot. Where most 9-year-olds would be instantly duh, bored with this thing, I'm having fun getting to know its capabilities.Samsung products appear to be excellent. And, it was refreshing to speak with a real human being when I had to call their customer service for advice on how to reset stuff. Very helpful.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought for my grandduater (5 years old) she doen't put it down. My son and his wife have toset times for the use. Great place for young ones to start to learn about computers,ect.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was a present to my wife. Yes she loves it. Now she reads at night, and I wear an eye mask to keep out the screen light. A definite improvement over a seven pound hardback book and a hundred watt lightbulb.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very happy with it. Although, an operating system update was just sent out by Samsung that completely reoriented everything on my home page after the update was installed. I basically had to redo everything on my homepage and I still can't find some of the things that I was using before. I liked the layout the way it was before. The operating system is also using more ram now. Very aggravating.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I did some comparision and it was better than the I-Pad mini or so I thought. I do like it and the apps are so easy to use. thanks
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought three of these for each member of my family. I did quite a bit of research on these before spending what amounts to me as a lot of money! I really don't believe a better choice could have been made, we all love these things! They have worked great since we've had them.We've only had one that would not turn on one time and it took what I assume is like a hard reset to get it going (hold down the power button and the volume down button for about 10 second and let up on the power button, another 5 or 10 seconds let up on the volume down), it was only the one time and really offers me no concern...these are computers and computers go nuts sometimes!Great little machines, nothing bad to say, would try to replace with the same if one got damaged.

tablet_galaxy_tab|...into the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 he got for Christmas! He loves it. He wanted the Galaxy Note 2. I talked him into having this for home and a new phone - less money for both of those with deals at Christmas. Well, he loves the new phone too - and has transitioned from iPhone addiction well - he can now consider himself an Android. For a non-techie - this is a great thing for me (the techie in the family who is tired of being the free customer service person). I'm sure the Galaxy Note 2 is wonderful - we tried it out - but I asked him &#34;seriously? are you going to carry this as your phone?&#34; Sorry, Note2! If you are vascillating like he did - do what we did - get this (or some tablet) and a new phone (with a great deal) - much more practical.This tab is fast. Easy to use. Great screen. Easy to set up. Just great. Perfect gift. (and this is from someone who tried a &#34;cheaper&#34; version - that shall remain unamed - which we quickly took back).
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great 7 inch tablet. Download the Samsung Kies software when you plug it in to your PC and the Jelly Bean update is available. Makes a great tablet better.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was a Christmas gift for my fiance. She loves it!! The 7 inch screen is just the right size for portability and convenience. It has a nice display the speed is decent. I recommend it for anyone thinking about making the tablet plunge!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this tablet for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas. Overall we were happy, but since day one I noticed it charged too fast (compared to my Nexus 7). I really didn't think about it much until the battery just started dying. We would plug it with about 20% battery and 2 min later it would say 100% charged. Of course I would unplug it and sure enough the battery was not charge. Fortunetly I am returning this one and getting a refund. Since my daughter really liked her tablet I will get the same model once more and hope it was just bad luck.I prefer my Nexus 7 (feels more sturdy in my hands) but Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 with all the little extras (skins, UI and camera) on top is a very close second for me. My daughter loved it and if we don't have an issue with the battery life of the new one I could easily give it 5 stars.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Thought I'd go with a less expensive tablet - boy was that a mistake. I returned the other one and paid a little extra for the Galaxy 2. I've had it for about a month and I love it! Easy to use, the screen resolution is awesome! Well worth the price!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Recieved this as a christmas present . Love it for networking, skype, reading, browsing, netflix etc. Doesnt take great photos, iphone takes better photos and videos. And facebook lags. Otherwise everything else is amazing and I would purhase again.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am truly enjoying my Sansung Tab 2 - but I am much more impressed with the service at Amazon. I purchased and received my lst Tab 2 in early Jan. It was charged and I was able to learn it's workings.However, when it indicated I need to charge the battery, I found the cord was not in the box. I called and spoke with a delightful young lady who simply said &#34;I will send you another and email a return label for the Tab you have&#34;. The 2nd tab was overnighted and was complete. I have told everyone I have seen about the kind and courteous treatment I received. Not something normal in todays working world. I would not hesitate to order from Amazon again or recommend Amazon to anyone. This was a most pleasant shopping experience.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Amazing product. For the money, it is by far better than the ipad and it's my kindle doesn't even compare.It was extremely easy to start using, after updating the apps that were preloaded, i was able to log into my gmail and it automatically updated my personal calendar, emails, settings, automatically stayed downloading all the apps from my nexus phone, it even installed my touchpal keyboard and background picture. Very impressed.Movies...netflix, crackle, amazon and hulu stream perfect, sound and video are excellent! NO buffering, even when I'm on a weak wifi signal.Some of the main things i looked for when buying this:front and back camera, this has both, and they work fine, but i wouldn't count in it for great vacation pictures. Skype works well.Flawless movie stemming, which i give 5 stars.microSD card slot: it has one, i would not have purchased it if it did not, but, it did not tell me anywhere in the description that you can not move apps into the card. Only pictures and whatnot. Total bummer for me. The sd card slot, in my opinion, is a hoax to get you to buy a product. This is almost a deal breaker for me.The only other complaint i have is you can't download flash player. So i can't stream football games or tv shows from a lot of websites. Big disappointment.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love this product for my 5 year old...great alternate to the ipad mini. Im surprised though there are no Disney or Nickelodeon apps like there are with ipad? Very strange. Other than that all other good childrens apps were. Not alot of childrens cases avaialable either but I found a nice leather one that supports it just fine. Overall satisfied with the purchase

tablet_galaxy_tab|Recently there was an article in the "New York Times" cautioning buyers of tablets to try them in the store "hands on" before making a decision. When purchasing my Galaxy Tab 2 I didn't. I also was not paying much attention to its features (or lack thereof). Here is what I have learned after three month's use.This is my first tablet and for the most part I think it is terrific. Because I have an aversion to Apple's business model and because I have found that the many Samsung products I own are of excellent quality, the Tab 2 was my obvious choice. In addition I have three year's experience with the Android OS and expected the learning curve to be substantially shorter. It was. The 7" screen is the perfect size. I can't imagine how I would navigate the 10".What I wish I had been paying attention to are:1) This tablet was engineered for right handed people. This makes perfect sense since most of the world is right handed. Unfortunately I am not.2) There is noSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi) flash which means that for all practical purposes snaps are limited to those taken in bright light. Goodness knows there is plenty of room on the back of the unit for a flash.3) The buttons on the right side are a design disaster. The top one turns the screen or the tablet on and off. Right below it is a rocker switch to control the volume. Their feel to the touch is exactly the same. Good luck on being able to tell instantaneously which switch your finger is touching. The obvious answer would have been to put the On/Off switch on the top of the tablet.4) The socket for connecting the tablet to the world or the charger is on the bottom. If you plan on lying in bed with the tablet in the vertical position resting on your belly it can't be done without seriously bending the cable. There seems to be plenty of room on the left side of the tablet.I purchased the Samsung 2 7" Wifi Tablet in November. I am reasonably happy with my $199 purchase. Because there are now so many choices at the lower end of the price range it means that it is going to be more difficult to give them a hands on try. That being the case, make very sure you can return your purchase if you try it out and are disappointed.Good luck - but caveat emptor.

tablet_galaxy_tab|My first tablet was Acer A500 10 inch tablet. It still runs well but I'm starting to find the weight was starting to bother my wrist after extended use. I have checked several 7 inch tablet models (Apple, Nexus 7, IBM etc.,) and decided to take chance on Samsung 7 inch tablet. Because several early reviewers have posted issue with battery/charge problems, I have hedged my bet by ordering from Costco due to its very generous return policy of 90 days.As tablet goes, set-ups are pretty straight forward, I activated Google and Samsung accounts and the tablet was set to go. As others have already noted, this tablet comes with paltry 8GB of internal memories with half of it already taken over by bloatware. It can however, take 32GB micro-SD card so that helps to store your video, e-books any download you will inevitably do.Some reviewers have complained of having issues with wi-fi connectivity depending on how you hold the tablet. I have had no problems here. Signal reception was excellent both at free wi-fi spot at Kaiser Hospital and my home wi-fi network.Anyone who have owned android smartphone and tablets should have no problems playing around with this toy. The screen is veritable fingerprint magnet so I have ordered screen protectors which I will apply as soon as it arrives.If you try to read in bright sunlight....well, good luck. But indoor, it is pleasure to use. It may not have the best screen but I found it more than adequate when compared to my old Acer 10 inch.Battey life is not the best. If you do not have power-saving features on and you have wi-fi enabled, you can almost see the battery drain noticeably.In closing, I picked Samsung 7 inch Galaxy Tablet 2 for its low price, ability to accept external memory card, decent screen and light weight. I am not a power gamer so not having the latest CPU is not an issue for me.If I have issue with battery/charge down the road, then I will do an update.UPDATE: 03/05/13I've noticed that on some website, Samsung installed browser may give you problem with accessing. If so, install another browser like Opera portable and access problem will go away.

tablet_galaxy_tab|First off I'd like to say I am extremely happy with Amazon and the delivery, as far as damage, timing etc. The item arrived 3 days before it was supposed to arrive and the box was in perfect condition. I tried to buy this tablet on another website and they never shipped it, and as a result I had to file a claim to get my money back and cancel my credit card. I have a lot of friends with iPads and they haven't really used anything other than that product. I don't understand why people would use them if the memory is not expandable, plus they freeze frequently. I tried telling them they're just buying the name. Well when I brought this Galaxy Tab 2 to work, and showed them what it was capable of, they were very impressed. In fact, one of my co-workers bought one the next week! I am very pleased with this tablet, even though I don't use it because it was a gift for my girlfriend, but she loves it as well. Never had a problem with it and it was worth every penny.I gave this product 5 stars simply because of what it can do. And to those who think a 7 inch is too small, it's not! Trust me on this one.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've been debating on a long time on what tablet I should get. Finally, I decided to get this fine piece of device. Although I had to wait a couple of weeks because the item was out of stock, I must say it was worth the wait. I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeee it. :). I even bought one for my friend as a gift although he did not see the need for the tablet because he already has a laptop. Well, he is enjoying it now. The screen is responsive and efficient. I would advise to get a screen protector and a case and you're good to go.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm a fan of most everything Samsung does anyhow. But when I really started looking at tablets for personal use, I started realizing that I didn't really like the 10&#34; tablets. I come to realize that the 7&#34; tablet was just what I was after.This thing is really nice...though it would be really nice if it came with Jelly Bean. The stock model comes with Ice Cream Sandwich, which is a big step up from the Froyo/Gingerbread/Honeycomb series of Android releases, but Jelly Bean has so many cool features...it's a shame to have such a nice tablet and ignore it for the latest O/S release.If you're brave enough, it's easy enough to root and put a CyanogenMOD release of Jelly Bean on it.It is an awesome unit - bought my wife one too. She uses it nearly every day.Very much recommended.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I just bought this tablet yesterday at a local Walmart (because BestBuy was sold out) and I must say, it's awesome! I haven't been a fan of the Android OS because I've always thought it was too complicated, but I changed my mind. I own an iPad 2 and I didn't want to buy the iPad Mini because I was basically going to get the same thing in a smaller size, so I ventured towards Android and found the 7" Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 which is a little smaller than the iPad Mini. I'm a HUGE Apple fan (I own Apple TV, Macbook Pro, iPad 2, iPhone 4, iPod Nano and iPod Touch), but recently I feel that they are making their customers spend money over and over again on the same things with just a few updates and I feel that isn't fair. Again, this little tablet is wonder for a first tablet, fans of Android, and Apple fans who choose not to buy an iPad Mini because they own an iPad. At first it took me a few hours to get use to the Android OS, but the more I use it, I'll get better. Great tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Worked great, shipped and delivered on time. No problems what so ever. I loved it!!! it is so easy to use and so small you can carry it anywhere. Doesn't have a lot of memory but you can use an external memory card so it is not a big deal. Really like the buy. I would recommend buying it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is the third 7inch Android wifi tablet purchased within the previous 18 months. The Galaxy Tab 2.7 is by far the best of the lot. The first tablet was broken by our cat, now I consider his action a blessing. The second was, another inexpensive tablet, a bit better but still little more than a ereader.The Samsung is slick, fits the hand well, is very fast to load and surf. It does come with a bunch of pre-installed apps, some useful, most not. Will be stuck with these apps until the tablet gets rooted. So far every app I have installed work just fine. It is very good device, easy to use, has decent speakers (for a tablet) and can used as another infared remote for devices in the home. (now I can hide the satellite tv remote and control what everyone at home can watch and when. Power at last!)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Awesome mini-computer. Easy to carry, full function internet tool, can use at public and home wi-fi. Inexpensive. Love it, just what I needed.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm surprised at how much I like this little tablet. I bought this for my mom who has trouble with PC's so I figured this would be help. I spent some time setting it up for her. After that I tempted to get my own. So far it seems snappy and not sluggish. Has some Samsung custom stuff, but it looks like it mainly stuck to stock Ice Cream sandwich. Some useless pre-installed apps, but easy to remove out of sight. I set up widgets with favorites that I think my mom can use. Nothing standing in my way to set up and get working any favorite apps. Even put in some pics of her grandkids.Overall what got me to buy it was the external SD storage. I don't like the trend of tablet makers selling no external storage then jacking up the price $100-$150 for 16 GB and 32 GB. I hope that practice goes away.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was a little nervous about this tablet only because of the Nexus also being out and seeming like a better deal in many respects. However I have found this to do everything I want it to.In comparison to the nexus I love that I can put in a micro-sd card, and although it states only up to a 32GB card, I have found that it will actually take a 64gb sd card (if formatted properly). Additionally I love the IR blaster, and although it comes with its own app there are other apps (touchsquid in particular) that is awesome, and through which I can control every IR device in my house easily. The reason I mention this is because it gets rid of my need for other device and remotes as long as I have my Galaxy Tab 2 with me (which of course I do).Tablet is very solid, and feels well put together, not plastic-y or cheap build.Cons: Battery life is ok, 7 hours or so I think, this could be better, and I am really not a fan of proprietary connectors, I wish they would stick with Micro USB etc.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I wanted this to watch movies and play games. It works to do both. For me the major selling point was the added memory you can get from a microSD. It allows me to have all the movies and music I want right there with me on this tablet. I have an iPad3 and my daughter has a Google Nexus7 this is not in the same league with them for speed and newest technology. But isn't what it was purchased for. It's small and easily taken everywhere I go. YES I would recommend this item.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I can safely say hands down that this is the best tablet built right now without the apple tax of the Ipad
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really like this tablet, the size, the features, nearly everything. But anyone considering buying this should be aware of what I consider significant space availability issues. While the tablet is listed with 8 GB of storage, the effective amount available is around 4.5 GB. Plus, it's loaded with bloatware that I don't want & will never user, and there's no way to move apps off to an SD card like on my Galaxy SII phone. So I'm happy with this for now but it doesn't seem viable as my long-term tablet solution. Sadly. Samsung, really???

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have the Ipad but I gave this to my sister for her bday and she loves it. Some say it is better than Apple. I will say that they may be right. You can do a whole lot thru the google market and the wifi service is Fast!!!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I was skeptical after reading reviews but bought the Galaxy because of the OS and open nature of the product. I owned around 400 ebooks in four different formats so wanted one device to read them all. I wanted to be able to do email and a little web browsing. Also wanted some of the same apps as my Droid. I was not disappointed with the device. It has been great tablet. Battery life meets my needs. I have Kindle, Nook and Mantano loaded with all my books. I live block from the beach and can read the screen with no problems. The tablet has been very stable with only two minor app glitches that were quickly fixed. It recently upgraded to newest OS and happy with the improvements. I would definitely buy another.

tablet_galaxy_tab|To be fair, this is my first tablet purchase so my review is not relative to any other tablet options. However, I do consider myself a tech junkie and did a good bit of research before my purchase.My motivation for buying a tablet was to make my job easier. I'm an outside sales representative and meet with many clients in their homes or businesses. I needed a tablet that had a rear facing camera, expandable storage, and blue tooth capabilities.I thought I had found the perfect tablet, and had until I tried to print. When I'm meeting with clients, I need to print contracts, product literature, financial information, etc. Normally, I do this from my laptop to my blue tooth portable printer.However, carrying a laptop can be cumbersome and time consuming to set up. The Galaxy Tab 2 was the perfect solution, except that you can only print to a Samsung printer! Yes, there are apps that allows you to print to other printers, but only via wifi. Blue tooth printing, however, is limited to Samsung only.I realize my application is very specific, and not likely to be an issue to many others. So, to be fair, it seems to accomplish other tasks admirably. My daughter plays games on it. I've watched a few YouTube videos and music sounds great through the speakers.So, all in all, a good tablet but the printing limitations are a deal-breaker for me.*** Edited Review - a follow-up comment to my review suggested an app that may work for Bluetooth printing. IT WORKED!! I'm beyond relieved that this tablet will do the job. I'm changing my review to 5 stars. At this price point, and with the ability to run my business through this tablet, there's nothing more I could ask for.

tablet_galaxy_tab|The unit has so far has impressed me. I am not a standard (regular tablet user.) It was purchased for my daughter in Mid November for a Xmas present. So I had it a while. My wife has an iPad so this is where I get my reference from.From out of the box the unit had a nice solid well built feel to it. I did not play with it much at first because I didn't want to drop it while it was not protected. Once in the protective cover, I had a chance to use most of the neat features of the unit. I have not tested the video quality yet.Pros:In comparison with the iPad, I find it quite useful if not more so. For one thing I was able to get it to print to my Epson R2000 since it was on my network. This is likely something the iPad can do but I have not really looked that hard either. The network connection seems to hold very well. I was even able to do limited network intensive operation while tethering to my BB on bluetooth. The mapping program works great, even on BT. The camera takes really good pics, much better than the iPad ver. 2. The movement around the screen was just as fluid as the iPad's. As far as loading apps, that was relatively painless with Google play, I can even send apps to the unit while logged into my google account. That is a huge plus, since I am not the primary user of it. The battery life seems to be on par with what to expect from devices such as these. With about 8 hours daily use it would be good to plug it in for the night for an overnight charge. One of the biggest pros to me is the remote app that you can use to program all your devices in your home (bye bye Harmony!)Cons:The only thing I can think of is the fact that the antenna is not that strong. I was in a hotel and easily picked up the wireless with my laptop. With this unit it seemed a bit more difficult. This seems to be a problem with many tablet devices. But while in my home it does just fine.Conclusion:Pound for pound this unit will hold it own with the iPad ver 2. But with the cost in the equation, this wins out big. Especially with the remote app. Now I just have to figure out away to get it from my daughter. ;)Also, nothing gets 5 stars from me...

tablet_galaxy_tab|I had originally looked at the nexus 7 but after I thought it over I had decided to go with the galaxy tab. It feels amazing in my hands and I am able to hold it for hours. I originally had the kindle fire which I was pleased with but found it to slow on the web with Amazon's silk browser. And there wasn't a large enough choice of apps. There are many more on the galaxy. The galaxy also has an sd card slot good for cards up to 32 GB of space. It also has a large amount of onboard space Wich was nice. Overall, I am very happy with this tablet and will recommend it to everyone.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I waited for the iPad Mini to come out, but when it did, I was disappointed in the price and the features. Insisting on 7 inch tablet that is a comfortable size for a reader, I considered all of the 7 inch models that were available at the time. Each one seemed to have different features that made it a better alternative than the others. What made me choose this one was the balance between the price and the features. While I know it doesn't matter for everyone, the expandable storage was a major selling point for me, even if the specs were a little less than the competition.So far, I have been completely happy. The display is crisp and clear, and the sound is great. This is a lightweight tablet that is easy to hold. I would say the one downside is the backside is smooth and doesn't provide much grip, so the right type of case may be necessary for some. I do not play resource-hogging games, so I can't speak for the performance of those apps, but as for the email app, web browser, and Kindle app (the 3 apps I use the most), the performance is excellent. I would consider this more of a productivity tablet and less of a gaming tablet, but if that's the type of tablet you need, this is the perfect balance of price, features, and performance.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I gave this to my husband as a gift for Christmas. He loves to play little arcade games to relax after work. It came ready to go out of the box and he's already loaded it with free games through the app store. It was easy to connect to our home computer through wi-fi. It is the smaller version but that makes it more portable. It is easier to play games on than a smart phone or ipod, both of which my husband has done. Overall it is a really neat little tablet. I got it at a sale price through Amazon so that made it even better.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have this one for work and an iPad for at home. I have to say, the Galaxy is an excellent choice for a budget shopper. It is very fast and the screen is very sensitive and easy to use. The battery does not last as long as the iPad, but this is a smaller unit. It fits perfectly in your hands and is easy to type on due to the perfect size. The iPad is rather large for typing and sometimes too big for easy surfing. This is an excellent bargain. The expandable memory is awesome! Very well designed.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've used a iPad and liked it but really didn't fall in love like everyone says they have, like my close family and friends. So I gave the iPad to my nephew but kinda missed have something quick to grab and not having to pull out the laptop, and my befriend told me about the Samsung and was thinking about getting it for his daughter which he did , I thought well I'll try it the price was great and I liked the size not too big. And when I got it, I loved it I'm a droid user and this was just so natural and easy for me use, I love the remote app it even works on my very old flat screen tv that my u verse remote couldn't turn it on or off. My only dislike is the flash no flash for camera and no flash support for media and videos.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I was loving this device until this past week. I was using it primarily as an eReader and was thrilled with it. This past week it began shutting off while in use, and it would not restart after a shutdown. I can plug it into the charger for approximately 24 hours and it will then usually restart. On this last incident it refuses to restart after several days on the charger.Since I still have my Amazon receipt, the box, and all materials I thought it would be no big deal; I'd just send it back to Samsung for repair. No such luck, Samsung tells me that my serial number is not valid. That's real funny, 'cause it's the same serial number I input when I registered the tablet on their site. At that time the serial number was valid and they even provided the manufacture date of the device.I'm not at all pleased with having a $250.00 paperweight or with getting the shaft from Samsung. I wasn't particularly upset with the problem with the device, things happen and electronic devices fail at times. What I cannot tolerate is a company that ignores their customers. I'm finished with Samsung products.-----In the interest of honesty and full disclosure I must update my review. Since my initial posting I was able to make contact with a Samsung customer service rep via online chat. I was finally able to convince them that my tablet was dead, and get return authorization. They emailed a UPS shipping label and my device went out this afternoon. I will update this review after my (or a replacment device) is returned.I have upgraded my opinion of the device and Samsung by one star. I still love the device, but I am troubled by the failure of it after only two months. I've read numerous other reviews by users who state that they have the same problem.I'll update my review when I see how this situation plays out.--------------Now, nearly three weeks after I sent my device in to Samsung for repair, I find out that my device will not be repaired. My device will be exchanged; apparently there would be a long delay waiting for parts to repair my device. I've spoken with a few very nice ladies at Samsung this evening. They're all pleasant, all very apologetic, and can't really give me a definitive answer on when I'll receive a replacement device. The third young lady I spoke with this evening was very pleasant, very professional, and did seem interested in trying to find answers for me...unfortunately it seems that another department has to call me to discuss the exchange of my device. When will they call me? Nobody knows.I was told that it should take another 11-12 days for the process to be completed. I'm just having a hard time understanding how, 3-4 days after you've determined that you cannot repair a customer's device and you're going to exchange it, how can it take nearly two more weeks to resolve this? I could understand a situation like this if I had an older unit, out of warranty, and they were doing me a favor. How can you drag out the repair or replacement of a new unit and call that customer service? How can you drag a customer through so much bureaucracy and expect that they'll be a happy customer and want to continue to purchase your products?I suppose my review has turned into a review of Samsung's customer service instead of a review of the Galaxy Tab 2, though Samsung's performance directly affects my opinion of the Galaxy Tab 2.Samsung does not seem to be a customer oriented company, instead it gives the impression of a government bureaucracy where no one seems to have a definitive answer and the solution to your problem is always one call transfer away. I LOVED the Galaxy Tab 2 while I had it, but the Samsung experience leaves much to be desired.Enjoy your Galaxy Tab folks and I wish you the best of luck. I think I'm giving up on this adventure and going to another brand.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Love the tablet so far, but I have found one issue that is bothering me. There is no option to move applications to the external SD card like there was with my android based phones. It appears that this is a known issue with the Samsung Galaxy line that was supposed to be resolved with ICS and has yet to be.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet has a descent sound level, the resolution could be better. It's too heavy to its size, weight is almost the same that the Ipad 2 10&#34;. I like it, the rear camera takes good pictures (during day). Video calls works perfect. I think for its price it could have came with 16 GB of memory instead of 8 GB. I hope this review has been usefull for you.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great priced tablet by a reputable brand. It is much heavier than the iPad mini tough and the screen is certainly not as big. But for the price is a good alternative if you don't want to buy a iPad mini.The main purpose of the review tough is to alert you: DO NOT BUY FROM ADORAMA. I bought from them because Amazon didn't have it available, paid more and bought new and no refurbished. Much to my dismay what I received was a VERY DIRTY and DAMAGED box with the "DO NOT ACCEPT IF SEAL IS BROKEN" already broken. The tablet altough it had the screen cover was full on fingerprints. Unfortunately the tablet was for a gift yesterday so I couldn't do anything about. Worst experience shopping from another seller than Amazon.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Finally found the tablet for me. Have an iPad in the family; too large for me, I prefer the 7" form factor. Have tried earlier Android tablets, found them to be lacking. Tried the Kindle Fire, good device but missing some key features.The size, price, features and performance of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 are the exact fit for me. I'm not going to rehash all of the pros/cons as they have been talked about quite a bit here. But this tablet is smooth, reasonably fast, the screen is good for the price, it has access to the larger Andoid app market, and Ice Cream Sandwich is a huge leap forward for Android.It may not be "the best" tablet money can buy, but it definitely hits the "sweet spot" of price/features/performance.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Having tried a Kindel Fire, a new Ipad, and the Samsung Galaxy, I can honestly report that the Galaxy performs like a small Ipad, and the Kindel performs like a small fishing weight, without the ability to catch any fish. Slooooooow, so slow to do anything, I mean make a pot of coffee, go to the bathroom, come back still hasn't loaded Yahoo slow. The Galaxy loads pages on Wifi as fast as a home computer, the color and definition are stunning, it comes with a tiny instruction book because it is so intuitive it doesn't need much instruction. The Galaxy, at half the price of the Apple, and playing flash, it is the no-brainer choice for a pad on a budget.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I will keep this short.1. I think 7inch is the right size.2. I have owned a viewsonic gtablet as well as a ainol paladin and an android phone.3. I dont like apple but not for a good reason. They make wonderfull products. I just dont like the price and culture.4. This tablet just works and is a breath of fresh air. Aps work, its very fast. I think this is the way Android is intended to be.5.Touchwiz is fine. Its not that different than stock. It does not slow anything down which is most important. Not sure why people are throwing fits.6. Have had zero problems with wifi.7. Kind of trickey to hold one handed due to no edges.8. Cameras are ok at best, but who cares.9. Battery life is great. Just had a baby so I spend a ton of time on this thing and it lasts all day. I get maybe 6 or 7 hours of surfing with 18 hours standby.10. ICS is worth it alone. So much better than 2.x series.Update: Has anyone noticed that Amazon won't show this on the home page? I have looked at this tab a week straight and they won't update my home page. (Recommendations)Also, order the Smart Case (ipad knock off) for the Galaxy Tab Plus. I hope it fits and will report.Update 2: I use the program Tunesync to put songs onto my tablet. I can save the audio files to the SD Card, and play them with the stock music player with no issues.Update 3: Battery life. I use this at work for email, browsing, and calendar functions. I no longer bring my laptop with me. This battery lasts all day into the night. This lasts far longer than any phone I have ever used. Very happy 1.5 months into ownership!

tablet_galaxy_tab|Looks to me that the pictures and the description on the page haven't changed in a very long time.Don't get confused by them, the pictures are of the european model, which as you can see, has no ir blaster and the product they are actually selling is the american one, which does have the ir blaster.Also, it doesn't come with android 4.0, but with android 4.1.1this are just some little things i thought it would be useful you knew. they aren't cons at all.I love my galaxy tab 2, is super comfortable to hold. it's not too big, it's not too small...it's just the perfect size.I can read my email, play games, browse the internet and enjoy a bunch of apps avaliable in google play and I paid less than 200 bucks!!?? i seriously couldn't be happier with this device. I totally recommend it! there is not another tablet like this at this price...you could say the nexus 7 but actually it is more than 200 and doesn't have a bunch of things the galaxy does have, for example, a memory slot and a rear camera.if you are like me and don't want to spend a lot of money in an ipad this is totally the device for you.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'll recommend this product to anyone, My advise to those buying expensive gear is &#34;Stop showing off&#34; an grow up. No one cares what you use and how much you spent on it...the bottom line is quality!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My boyfriend and I both both bought this tablet to take to school instead of our heavier and harder to lug around laptops, and we love it!!It very easy to use, light, and gets amazing battery life ( I get around 7 to 8 hours minimum usually) although it does take several hours to charge completely.I do have to say that this isn't a laptop, so don't expect it to function as one. We both got external keyboards for light typing and note taking but I don't recommend typing a 10 page essay on this thing because you will go blind.Likewise, no you can't move your apps to the SD card, something about the OS not allowing it.Overall, I've had no problems with this tabet, it's fast , responsive, and makes life much easier ( specially on the shoulders ) for any college student looking for an alternative other than their laptops on campus.ps: I just typed this whole review from said tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am so glad that I got this, I have had it for about a week now with no problems. It works just like a computer. I can hook up to netflix and stream movies and I can surf the web with ease. It is very easy to figure out, and the battery life is very nice. The camera is okay, I can take better pics with my phone. I am over all very pleased with this tablet!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I do have an iPAD; but my 16 years old wanted a 7" tablet, after some research i landed on this one... and I like it.. my daughter likes it too. it is stable, looks good, and has powerful hardware. it cannot, and should not be compared to the iPAD as they are different animals... apple OS is way more stable than Android, and they can do more with less hardware (processor speed and memory).back to the Samsung GT,,, it is a good device, and i do recommend it. The only issue i found is that it becomes very slow every couple of days especially after charging and needs to be rebooted.... i tried to kill process... but nothing cured the problem other than a reboot... so if you want to buy the device, plan on a reboot every couple of days.... (unless if the one we have has a specific issue that does not exist in other GTs).... anyways, the reboot takes a minute,.... so it is not a big deal ....
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tab is amazing I'm so happy with this purchase! Its light weight and portable, but its got everything you need right there. I use it for school and it is really useful.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 phone and love it, so I decided to try one of their tablets. Since I have an android phone, getting around the tablet was a breeze. The screen was good quality, though my phone seems more crisp. It was a little slow to react to my touch a few times. After using it for about 30 minutes to an hour it began getting very hot on the left side. I liked that I could hold it in one hand. I really liked this tablet, but the main reason I gave it three stars is because of the tablet getting hot and there was a blue dot continuously near the top left of the screen. It was a bad pixel and I even tried a few things to fix it, but it wouldn't go away. It was very obvious when watching movies. I also didn't like that when I went to a website, I couldn't hit full screen for videos. It would just let me zoom in, and the main buttons were on the bottom. They were continuously lit up and just annoying. For the price it is a great tablet, but I would advise just waiting since there are about to be some new tablets on the way.Pros: Price, customization, display, size.Cons: Web browser, overheating, random blue dot.Update 7/4/2012, added another star.I sent it back to amazon and picked up another one at Best Buy to try it one more time. This one was much better right from the start. It got a little warm while I recovered all my apps, but no where near how hot my previous one I had. The screen was also perfect, my first one had a messed up pixel. Maybe the first one I received was just a bad one. I absolutely love this tablet and with its price it can't be beat!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've had this tablet since mother's day and its really growing on me. I got a nice purple case to go with it and app for live wallpaper and I feel like a star! LOL! I have to fight with my 3 year old every night about who gets to play with it.The tablet gets a little laggy sometimes after I download a few new apps but if I restart it, it gets better. The screen could be clearer but this is a budget tablet. Overall, I like having this to call my own as a mom with 2 baby boys and a husband. It works like it should for the price. And, the size is perfect.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|When I was looking for a tablet, I did my research. I knew I didn't want to pay $600+ for an iPad, I knew I didn't want the Vizio that my mom has, this seemed like a great choice. You know what, it was an excellent choice. It's everything I needed or wanted in a tablet. The operating system is solid, it's extremely fast to boot up and load apps, movies look great, mp3s sound great, pictures look awesome, takes great pictures and movies, etc. You really can't go wrong with this tablet!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The tablet is great and if it weren't for touchwiz, it would get 5 stars from me. Touchwiz can make the tablet terribly slow and changes the default keyboard, way to create folders etc. In short, it kind of ruins the whole android experience. Android devices have got a lot of bad press because of these horrible skins that most manufacturers put. My advice to everyone would be to root the device and put something like CM9 on it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love the tablet, it works great. There isn't a horrible amount of bloatware installed (netflix, samsung store, and a few others).There are a few things that irritate me though. First, samsung uses a proprietary usb connection interface where a simple micro usb would have sufficed. Their "kies" usb transfer does not have linux support, and the device does not support "mass storage" mode, only MTP and PTP protocols which mount the device for media transfer or as a camera.For transferring data to the device, I have had some luck using sshDroid, but this does not consistently work, especially on local area networks, even with port forwarding. Kies Air did not work well with the Ubuntu system and kept giving transfer errors on large media files like movies. A good cloud service might be helpful (I'm using MS skydrive and google music). It seems like the best option may be to just use a micro sd card usb adapter to add content and insert it into the tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|At first the product seems to be great. Overall I was happy with the tablet after using it for about 3 months then a couple of days ago I was basically forced to update the device, there was no option to opt out of the update and that is the first problem. As customers we should be able to accept or reject the updates. I had zero problems with my tablet and I was happy with it but who cares about the customer right? After delaying the upgrade several times with 3 hour maximum notification time (not even a 24 hour option), I just had to do it, (I know there are drastic ways to avoid this but I took a path most customers take and did what the tablet was requesting every 3 hours and installed the update, BTW. I doesn't even tell you what version it is going to update it to, so they make it even harder on customers to know what they are getting into. After the upgrade/update most of my shortcuts were gone from the windows, the home layout was different, the notification bar was in the top and the behavior was very different from the previous version. You just have to start trying things in order to figure out the new behavior, clicking the notification bar didn't bring up the notifications now you have to pull them. Rotation will not rotate some of the shortcuts now they are in a fixed place, instead of having the shortcut to all the apps/widgets always on the top/right corner now it is on a fixed place and rotating won't move it. I used to be able to look at the clock while running all my apps and now with the change I have to get out of some apps to look at the clock. But the WORST part is that in less than 2 hours after the update the tablet froze and I had to do a hard boot (just pressing the power button did nothing) I had to keep the power button pressed for several seconds until it shutdown and then I was able to start it again. To be honest I never wanted to upgrade a perfectly working tablet. This type of things makes me stay away from these companies. They think they know what we need and for some it may be ok and they just see it as acceptable but for some people like me this is totally unacceptable, now I will have to use some drastic measures to downgrade it from 4.1.1 (I believe JB) to 4.0.4 (ICS) or now that I remember, I can return it to the store where I bought it and look for an option that give me more flexibility.UPDATE: After using it for another day with the 4.1.1 update I hate it even more, there is no screenshot button anymore, you have to press vol down and power buttons at the same time to take a screenshot and believe me half of the time it won't work and you need 2 hands to do it instead of one finger. The other thing is that the button to hide the keyboard is gone. Some people report improved performance but for me performance was not an issue and I don't notice any improvement on performance. I read somewhere that the IR Remote doesn't work on 4.1.1 and that was a selling point.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Amongst my family members, we have the ipad mini(which I own), nexus 7, and galaxy tab 2. Though not mine, I would rate the Samsung as the best deal. It's by far better than expected. Very Apple-like with respect to function and aesthetics. I use Macs and the transition to the Tab 2 would be easy-- more so than going from a Mac to a PC. I like the keypad feature with numbers across the top of the letters, which means you don't have to shift to access numbers. The word suggestion feature includes several possible words and is displayed in a row above the keypad. I find this much more comfortable to use than a pop up suggestion box. The screen is clear and colorful, similar to the ipad mini, and doesn't have the dull resolution of the Nexus 7. The Tab 2 also includes a document and spreadsheet app which is it's own version of word/excel. The sound quality of music played is not as high as my mini. Out of the three small tablets, I would recommend both the Samsung and Apple, as both are similar in quality and function. The Nexus 7 would rank in a below category-- not worth it's full price, and the quality does not attain the level of the other two. This device has changed my view of Samsung products for the good.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This device has an amazing feature set for the price point. I own the iPad 1 and the current iPad, and my beefs with them are lack of expandable memory and no flash. This little device has both, although you must download the flash app from the google store first for it to work. The IR blaster set up easily with my Sony TV, and I love the TV guide that is in the Peer app. The Kindle app gives a very clear text display. There is photo editing and even a cute little movie making app on here! Polaris office is good. I love the keyboard because the numbers are set above the letters like a regular keyboard. Dictation works great. No problems with WIFI here. My only disappointment is that the screen display lacks the vibrant color of other Samsung devices, but some people might prefer that. The display is adequate for most purposes, and you can set the font size to large, which helps with text. Pinch and zoom is smooth. The only app I find unacceptable is Facebook for Android. The text is very small and fixed. You cannot zoom it, so I can read it easier on my phone than on here. It looks better by going through the web browser, but still won't zoom. Other web pages are easily enlarged. There is a slight lag sometimes while scrolling, but you can open multiple pages with tabs, which the original iPad lacks. The speakers and volume are better than you will find in most laptops and netbooks and other tablets. Screenshots are so easily done that you have to be a little careful not to hit that button accidentally. If you install the "active applications" or program monitor widget, you can monitor what is open, and shut apps down periodically to save battery. Bluetooth works great, and will accept my Apple devices, but the Apple devices won't accept my Samsung devices. Unfortunately, it's my understanding that the adapter to load pictures from an SD card does not work with this device. I got the sleeve for the 7.0 and it fits well and doesn't add a lot of bulk. I just wanted something to protect it when I threw it in my purse. For me personally, I prefer the8.9 size and screen, but it costs more and does not have expandable memory.6/8/12 New feature! Now Bright House Digital Cable has added the ability for certain android devices to watch TV (as long as you are in your own house), and it works perfectly on this device. That's another bonus, because cable does not work on all tabs.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I own 5 tables from some of the other big names in the biz. Three are priced below the Galaxy Tab 2. Three have HDMI ports and real USB ports as well. Why Samsung did not add one to this device is making me starch my head. They make some of the best TV's with HDMI inputs just waiting to display tablet content and games on them. In my humble opinion this is a big misstep. I also say to Samsung please loose the propitiatory plug and use a real USB port.Now is any of this a deal breaker...? Not by a very long shot. I love this device and can not put it down.Some of the big name tablets I own my cost a little less but don't come close to the performance the Tab gives.The display is well above it's price point. The speed using the web and games on par if not better than many others at and beyond it's price point.It's small enough to put in a pocket, backpack or purse to take it on the run baby.The camera while not the best is very usable. You can't beat the 32gb sd slot foe movies, movies and more.Then Samsung just spiked the ball by adding a IR blaster and ICS....OOOOO....THIS THING IS NICE!!Update as of 5-25-2012Even without the HDMI and standard USB port this tablet just rock for this price.I am using the iMediaShare app to send movies and music to my tv and other devices and it works great on the Tab. As for my USB grip this is a nice work around at a low price...http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005YWIRBS/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i005 stars....pick it up

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have just spent over 2 hours with Samsung customer service. I presumed that the device would automatically allow me to write to the external SD card the same way my Android based phone does. NOT TRUE.After 2 hours the answer is that the internal storage can be downloaded to PC. There is NO option for transferring files of any type (even manually) to the external storage card.You can load the external storage with any files FROM your pc and access them on the device - to do this you have to use the My Files app (included with device).I find this truly disappointing and horrible design as well as underhanded marketing.The device is ok for other functions like internet browsing (but slow) and the screen resolution is acceptable (especially for the price)HOWEVER, I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THIS DEVICE IF I HAD KNOWN THAT THE EXTERNAL STORAGE IS ESSENTIALLY A "DUMMY" STORAGE AND CAN NOT BE THE ACTIVE STORAGE FOR REAL TIME USE!!!

tablet_galaxy_tab|Let me first say that I am no stranger to the tablet market. I started with the iPad 2 but then moved over to the 7" tablet form factor because I found that size to ultimately be more suited to my needs.I'm a big fan of Samsung products anyway (already have one of their phones) and so I started to dabble with their 7" tablets, starting with the gTab 7.0 plus. I liked it, but I wasn't wild about it, so I ended up selling it.Next I tried the gTab 7.7 from Verizon and, while it had an awesome screen and it blazed on 4g, I found that many apps didn't account for the additional screen size and so fonts were disproportionately small a lot of the time...not to mention that the 2 year commitment and initial price (despite being subsidized through the carrier) gave me more than one restless night's sleep, so ultimately - given that for the monthly and up front cost, it wasn't rolling my socks up and down - it went back.Enter the gTab 2 7" tablet. This one has proven to be the Goldilocks tablet for me...just right.First of all, it runs ICS which (IMHO) makes a huge difference in the user experience on a tablet over Gingerbread. Perhaps just because I am used to ICS from my Nexus phone, but I found this tablet iteration to be the most pleasant to use out of all of them.Obviously the gTab 2 7" can't out-spec the 7.7, but having had a 7.0 Plus, I can honestly say the differences are negligible. Is the Plus faster? Yes, a bit...but it was (at the time) also $399 to the tab 2's $249.I carry this Tab with me daily in my purse. It is solid enough to feel good in the hand, but still light enough not to make having it in my bag or holding it up for long periods of reading a burden. The screen may only be 170 ppi, and only 1024 x 600 resolution, but to be honest, it looks great just the same. I stream Netflix on it as well as play movies from an SD card and in my opinion it is a very good video watching experience.The cameras are only meh, but I have Skyped on it and it does fine. There were no complaints on either end as to quality.For the most part, I use my Tab as a consumption device; I watch movies, browse news aggregating apps like Pulse, read books (and for $249 I can have both my Kindle books and my Nook books with me on one device...sweet!), stream music, spend time on social media and waste my life playing Draw Something. I do appreciate the larger screen for managing my calendar and I have had occasion to do actual work on the thing too (though not often), which has been a good experience as well. In other words, I am not what you would call a power user - I am just your average consumer looking for a good product at a decent price point.Personally, I just love it. I think the price is right for what it is, and I really like that (as opposed to the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - both of which are good devices, don't get me wrong) I can have an honest to goodness Android experience with the Google Play Store, etc.Did Samsung need to put out yet another Galaxy Tab model? Probably not...but I have to say, owning this one, that I'm glad they did.

tablet_galaxy_tab|The tablet is incredible, but it has not flash player on it. so after a 2 days of look by internet how to install it. i finally find out the solution, follow the next step and you will see :1)ALL THIS IN YOUR TABLET...1)go to "Settings" > "Security" > "Unknown sources" and check "Allow installation of non Market apps"2) search in google.com ONLY/ANY - adobe flash player 11.1.115.12 apk - then installed it .3)Search in google.com a Dolphin HD browser apk ( you can use also Stock browser, but with dolphin in my tablet work perfect), installed.4)tap to open flash player and dolphin ( registrate) . EXIT FROM THERE .5)TURN OFF THE TABLET . SOME TIMES YOU WILL NEED TO RESET THE TABLET ( PUSH 1 SEC. THE POWER ON/OFF)TURN ON THE TABLET AND IT IS READY TO HAVE FUN,.GO TO INTERNET AND OPEN ANY PAGE THAT YOU KNOW THAT USE FLASH PLAYER ... EJEMP: DISNEY.COM/GAMES ADN CHECK IF WORKS.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Samsung is a force to be reckoned with in the android market. I have purchased a Nexus 7 which has a much smoother user experience, and a beautiful design, but it does not beat the Samsung Tab 2 7 and here is why:1. The Samsung device allows for removable sd cards. This takes away all of the storage issues that tablets have. I have a bunch of digital videos and music that I can watch or listen to just by swapping out micro SD cards. Granted Samsung should have given the device 16GB of internal stroage instead of 8GB, but the micro SD cards make this a non issue.2. Unlike the other 7&#34; android tablets like the Nexus and the Kindle this has a camera on the back which allows you to take decent videos and pictures. The picture quality is pretty good, but not great (I consider my iPhone 4 great in this area). It makes the tablet a very handy device for when you are traveling and want to take pictures and videos. I use it to shoot videos for my children when I am in Europe on business trips. This feature piggy backs on reason 1 listed above becasue you can save your video and pictures directly to the micro SD card.3. It has excellent video playback, gaming and web surfing.4. You can use it as a remote control for your TV and Cable Box. I can not tell you how liberating it is not to have to look for a remote control.The only thing that the device is missing is an mini hdmi out, and the reading experience could be a bit better. If you are buying a 7&#34; tablet to primarily read e-books then go with the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;, but if you want a full fledged device with full access to the android ecosystem then go with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7&#34;. The Nexus 7 has a cleaner design, and much better user experience (swiping is effortless) but they hobbled the device by copying the iPhone model of not allowing for external storage, yeah... yeah.... yeah I know about USB OTG, but it too clunky to have something sticking out the bottom of such a small tablet.The bottom line is that this is the best value in 7&#34; tablets!

tablet_galaxy_tab|We use it for everything, mostly for Facebook, web surfing, and games. One minor problem, the length of the charger cable is way too short.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very easy to use! Even though 7 inches sounds small you would never think that while using this tablet. Its perfect for browsing the internet and has great apps as well. One neat thing is that you don't ever really have to type on the keyboard because it has a microphone option on the keyboard itself allowing you to speak anything you want into text. I really enjoy it! And the speakers are pretty great too- I love music and love playing it on this device. The only thing that isn't 5 stars is the camera just cuz its a little low quality, but I didn't buy this wanting a camera so its no biggy :).
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Although this was for my Mother-in-law, I like it far better than my IPAD 3! The Open-sourcing of Droid operating system, ease of use, beauty and affordability makes my IPAD a sorry purchase indeed.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really like this thing... wish it had a little more internal memory for apps but it does allow for a 32 gig Micro SD card. The card will allow storage for music, photos, etc... but you can't put any apps on the card, meaning 8 gig is your limit. It's actually less because some of that 8g is used for the operating system. That being said, I am still very happy with my purchase... how many Apps does one need anyway?The Galaxy Tab is great for taking along.. to say... the doctors office, car repair garage, etc. It has a real nice browser & I can catch up on my email & FB. Many places have wireless access now so who needs magazines in the waiting room? It's pretty zippy too.. quick to come on & the battery lasts pretty much all day. It has both front & back cameras & it shoots pretty descent videos too. All in all, I'm glad I made this purchase & I'm having a lot of fun with it... SO, get yourself one!!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm going to try to make this concise and hit the major points, so it will help all you tablet-seekers make an informed decision before you finish your x-mas shopping.About me: 30s, non-technie, don't care one way or the other about gadgets. I do have an iPod touch, which I love, but the screen is simply too small for me to do a lot of things I wanted to do with the tablet.What I use the Galaxy Tab for: E-mails while traveling, Netflix, e-books/audio books, apps.Since I've never had a tablet before, some of these things may be typical of all tablets or unique to the Samsung. In any event, here are my pros and cons:Pros:+Vibrant screen, easy to watch movies, read, and use apps+Touch is, for the most part very responsive (see my comment below)+Easy to navigate the unit despite never using an Android device before+Battery life is impressive, even after watching movies or reading for several hours+Easy to get accessories for (case/stand/usb keyboard)+Optional 32G SD card, which you pop right in and forget about+Price: with the exception of all of the additions you will need (case, memory card, extra charger, etc.) it cost the same as my iPod touch with much more functionality/features+Weight: perfect for travel, lightweight yet sturdy (I even take it to the gym and use it on the elliptical machine)+GPS!Cons:-The WiFi signal seems inconsistent. Not that it's bad, but hovers around average, even if I'm near my router-Links on the internet are sometimes not responsive to touch. Not sure if that is the browser or the websites themselves-Netflix can be laggy, especially when it buffers-This is a major one for me...the volume rocker and the power button are nearly on top of each other. I'm not very tactile so almost every time I go to adjust the volume I inadvertently turn the screen off. Really annoying but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it-Android apps require a ton of permissions. As in, they basically tell you how they are going to invade your privacy. Maybe iOS apps do this too and they just don't tell you. I also don't like that a lot of apps require full-time access to the internetIn sum: for the difference in price I would definitely choose this tablet over a knock-off in the $100 range. it is a user-friendly, fully-functional, and handy accessory for travel or anyone "on the go". The only thing I would consider upgrading is possibly to a bigger screen, but then you sacrifice weight and portability factors.Happy holidays!

tablet_galaxy_tab|When I finally decided to buy a tablet, I literally spent days researching everything that was out there. For the price and features, the absolutely best deal is the Kindle Fire HD 7", which I bought and love. Unfortunately, the Kindle does not have Adobe Flash Player and it cannot be installed on the Kindle. Since one of the primary reasons I wanted a tablet was to access websites that require Adobe Flash Player, I found the need to purchase another tablet. From my previous research, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 had been my second choice, again for the price and features it offered. The Galaxy Tab is exactly what I needed and performs flawlessly! I love this tablet and recommend it for anyone who wants a small tablet that can do just about anything you want it to. The price is excellent and the compact size makes it extremely versatile. I can take it anywhere as it fits very nicely in my purse, even with the case on it.Additionally, for those who need a tablet with Adobe Flash Player, this is the only tablet on the market that comes pre-loaded with AFP. As of 08/15/12, Adobe is no longer producing AFP for Android systems and it is not available to download. So, if you do not have it pre-loaded you will not be able to get it. This may or may not be of consequence to you, but if it is then please take advantage of the days I spent researching all of this information. For more information, please follow this link: [...] OR do a search for Adobe Flash Player for Android and choose the "Android's Flash Player is dead - live with it|ZDNet published on August 15, 2012 by David Meyer.The Galaxy Tab is the only tablet in the $200 to $250 price range that has AFP. I did not research the higher-end tablets since I had decided this was the maximum I was willing to spend. I also did not research the lower-end tablets, under $150, as the majority of them have older operating systems like 2.2 or 2.3 and are only 4GB. Technology continues to change too fast to spend any more money, in my opinion, as it will be obsolete in a very short period of time.In closing, the Samsung Galaxy Tab is an awesome little piece of technology that I am sure you will thoroughly enjoy owning.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this tablet because of many things, even tough I was thinking that the Fire HD 7 inch was better. The price was better, but I knew this one was better. Something that really helped me in my decision was the fact that the galaxy has 2 cameras, and you can take photos, record videos and use it for many apps of video chat like Skype or ooVoo, but in the Fire, you have only a front camera that is only used for Skype video calls.Other thing that made me go for the galaxy is that you have access to the Google Play Store, and in the Kindle Fire you only have access to the Amazon app store, which has less number of apps than the Play store.Definitely, the best 7 inch tablet is the Galaxy Tab 2. There are just a lot of cool features that I cannot mention all of them, but be sure that this one is a great choice.

tablet_galaxy_tab|The Tab2 is an excellent value and you would be hard pressed to beat it's performance and features at any price point. It does fine with any tablet function. Movies are crisp and the big games play without hesitation. The 7 inch format is really nice (if I wanted something bigger I'd probably drag my laptop around).I guess the hottest things on the market are the Google Nexus and the Ipad, but neither of these have an sd Slot for endless memory. I don't want to be tied to cloud storage for media. It would be nice however if the Samsung had a bit more core storage. Eight Gig would be enough if half of it was not taken up by unremovable Samsung apps that I don't use (well I guess I could root it).Pros:Solid design and workmanship.Good battery life / quick chargeGood default keyboard / access to any GP android apps.Sound using headphones is excellent.Cons:You can block the wifi antenna cutting bars if you hold it wrongThe Keis computer sync program is a pig/ you don't need it on W7.You can't put apps on the sdCard without rooting.Direct hdmi connect to tv is iffy. The special cable is missing in action and the old one won't work.I haven't been able to get AllShare to fully work but thats just a tinkering thing.It's a great small tablet and of course Amazon had it at my door really fast.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I realy wanted a tablet with the bells and whistles but a compact size. This is perfect. I love how this fits in my purse or lab coat at work , it has Kindle app and KOBO ebooks, fast internet access, great camera yes a two way camera , and affordable .

tablet_galaxy_tab|Not having experience in the world of touch screen stuff, my sox are gone! I had to have a young geek friend show me the basics. I'm almost 70 so I didn't care to have to read the PDF manual at 120 pages or so. This thing worked fine at his home, but wouldn't let me enter the wifi world at mine. Thinking my ISP was having problems, I called and was asked if I had a new modem. If so, they needed the CAT #. Duh me. After that, my speed went from 2.4 meg. to almost 28 meg. down. Problem solved with the tablet. The downloading of books from Amazon worked amazingly fast too. I know I'm green, but I'm sure I will have plenty of enjoyment with this device in the coming years. That is, if my batteries hold up. Outside of a boring and difficult to understand manual, I don't know why anyone would be disappointed with this instrument of elderly confusion. It responds well to finger touch. Almost too much. And it doesn't seem to me that it lags with instructions to go from one request to another. But then, I'm only green. Time will tell if it continues to behave properly.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm an Android fan from way back, and picking this up from Amazon for a Father's Day self-gift was easy. Amazon had it to me in two days and I charged it for a couple of hours before turning it on and setting it up. Sure, I was stepping up to the Ice Cream Sandwich operating system from Gingerbread on my Droid phone, but that shouldn't be much of a switch, right?Wrong! I've been pounding on keyboards and phones for a long time, but my first 15 minutes on the Galaxy Tab 2 was not as simple as I thought it would be. I couldn't quite figure out the icons for moving around and my Gmail account did not get setup correctly. I contacted Samsung's online Support chat function and they were nearly worthless. They told me to click on options that didn't exist, so I had the Tab back in the box, ready to ship back to Amazon.Well, I gave the Tab another chance, wiped the deck clean (I reset the device to its original out-of-the-box state) and started over. The second time was the charm. My Gmail account was setup just fine (I use Google's Authentication function on my Google accounts, so that may have affected my first attempt) and the Tab has shined brightly ever since. The device is a quality build, a perfect size and integrates with my Google applications very nicely. Netflix runs my movie selections flawlessly and the battery seems to last a long time between charges. For $249, it is a steal. I toyed with the original Amazon Kindle Fire when it came out, but it is very limited in comparison with the Tab 2. If you want a really good reader and Amazon store browser, the Kindle Fire is a great tablet for those things. If you want to pay 25% more, but end up with a tablet that can do a lot more online and with Google Play Store applications, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is your next tablet computer.Positives:High quality build - it feels like a well designed tablet in your handGreat size - if you want a screen bigger than your phone, but small enough to read a book upon, the seven inch tablet form factor is great. The iPad is waaaaaay too big and clunky for causal reading.Fast - screen switching from landscape to portrait is 'right there'. Moving among screens is smooth and quick.Display - gorgeous. Vibrant colors, natural and realistic.Open - you can sideload apps (get them from non-google and non-Amazon sources) and the machine is not just an Amazon tool.Expandable - you can add a microSD card to this to expand your storage, add movies, music, etc.Keyboard - nice size and quite accurate. (If you've typed on a smartphone, you know how challenging it can be to keystroke accurately.)Negatives:Sound - there seems to be just one speaker, at the bottom. It is easy, while watching Netflix, to cover it with your hand. The sound is ok, but won't win any awards for faithful reproduction of low notes.Samsung support - they don't make it easy and their techs don't seem to know this new product very well yet. Phone support would be helpful, but Samsung uses a very slow paced chat service where you type in your questions and the tech takes FOREVER to respond. (But don't take long, yourself, to respond to them, or they'll terminate the chat!)

tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is not meant to compete with iPad 2 or 3, any of the high end android tablets like the Asus prime. This is in the medium budget category and it packs in a whole bunch of value for your money, even more than high end tablets in some cases.Pros:Android OS (you have a lot more customization, widgets, full web, easier to download and move files unlike the walled garden that is iOS)Screen (not the best, but no light bleed on my unit, and it doesn't have the diamond shape when you look closely at it like the kindle)Sound (speakers can easily fill your close surrounding, and you get stereo not mono sound unlike the iPad and Asus prime which are supposed to be high end devices)(Also headphones produce louder better sounding music the.Camera (nothing special but for $50 more than the kindle you get two cameras rear and front facing so video chatting is possible)AGPS (nothing special works, just the Kindle iPad 2,3 wifi, and some Asus primes don't even have it)Bluetooth (something the Kindle doesn't have)Performance (Both a pro and a con, it works great for video watching, web browsing, listening to music but can stutter on high end 3d games).Storage (8gb of onboard space +32gb micro sd card expansion+ because downloading and moving files is much easier than iOS online storage solutions like dropbox, of which you get an extra 50gb for one year with the tablet, work much much much better and can actually be useful and less of a headache).Music (The stock player is fine, but you can download any other player. Also I would download the equalizer app which makes the music much better).Videos (Plays any video format that I have thrown at it without the need of external apps, I use the mx player because it makes it much easier to view videos with gestures for brightness, audio, and fast forwarding. Netflix works without any issues.)Size (Is both a con and pro, because it's smaller it's more mobile and makes for an easier typing expierence).Battery life (It's around 8 hours and recharges fast especially when you compare it to the iPad 3).Remote ( Has the peel remote app and an IR which makes it compatible with most TVs and home theaters).Price ($250 for all these feautres is not a lot, and considering it's only $50 more than the kindle and you're getting so much more this makes it an amazing buy) In some sense your getting more than the $499 new iPad 3.ConsPerformance ( High end 3d games can stutter every now and then).Screen (Small for long movie watching, but this can be rectified with a samsung hdmi adapter and then hook it up to the TV.)

tablet_galaxy_tab|Like some other reviewers, I also own an iPad and an iPod (but no iPhone). I think of the Galaxy Tab 2 as filling a niche between the iOS products, mainly because of its physical size. If Apple decides to make a 7-inch iPad, that would probably serve just as well. But I was eager to try the Tab 2 to give me a feel for how Android performs relative to iOS. In addition, the price was definitely right.Bottom line: I'm happy. Not deliriously so, but happy. It does take a little time to get used to how to manipulate Android if you've been using iOS for a couple of years, but it's not a major hurdle. As a user of many Google products, I was impressed at how seamlessly Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) integrates with them; no contortions are required to access them or sync with them. I also appreciate the greater flexibility in setting up screen views, the use of widgets, and the fact that seldom-used apps are kept in the background. Also, Android/ICS lets you keep track of your files in a number of ways, which iOS keeps hidden from the user.A few minuses. First, the physical switches on the Tab 2 are easy to press by mistake; since the Tab 2 is relatively small, you're almost bound to hit one of them while holding it--I'm clumsy, to boot, which makes it even more likely. Second, the software keyboard has the small delete and enter keys right next to each other; I can't count the number of times I've pressed enter while trying to delete an entry. Third, the camera is nothing to write home about. And finally, there's very little documentation on how to use ICS; if you've been using a previous version of Android, it's probably a no-brainer, but those of us immersed in iOS could use a little help getting started.As for overall value, no question about it: The Tab 2 is great value for the money. It's only fifty bucks more than a Kindle Fire, and it uses pretty much a generic version of ICS, not a proprietary version, which means that most apps from the Android store can run on it without bother (I've found exceptions, though). It's definitely found a permanent home with me, and is likely to be what I carry around with me day-to-day. The iPad is a heavier-duty big brother, most useful when I'm sitting and doing a lot of reading, or need the larger screen real estate that it offers.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased the 7-inch Galaxy because it has good reviews and I preferred the smaller size. Two things made me return it. First, it is supposed to be an 8gb tablet with expandable memory up to 32gb. Nearly half of the pre-loaded 8gb was taken up by apps I didn't need, wouldn't use, and couldn't delete. I could have dealt with that since I purchased a 32gb SD card. However, I soon discovered that even downloaded apps can't be placed on the SD card - only content.I had also planned on using the tablet for reading documents and doing some minimal editing. The word processing program on the tablet is very difficult to use and has extremely limited capability.On the positive side - listening to music, reading books, and watching video on the Galaxy were all easy and enjoyable. The Galaxy was definitely made for entertainment.Bottom line - if you need an upgraded version of an e-reader, then the Galaxy is a great option. If you need more space and functionality, look elsewhere.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I was recently in the market for a small tablet and had to make a choice between the Galaxy Tab 2.0 7-inch and the new Google/Asus Nexus 7. I chose the Galaxy for 2 main reasons: - Expandable memory - Rear-facing camera (with video)My use for a tablet is primarily for checking e-mail and Web browsing throughout the house (much more portable and quicker to use than a laptop).For me, having a camera is useful for those times when the tablet is closer/quicker than hunting down the digital camera, or for quickly taking a picture and posting it online. There are also some apps that make use of the onboard camera, and having a rear-facing camera allows you to point the camera and see (on the screen) what it's looking at.The expandible memory is a nice-to-have but hasn't been an issue so far. If I start putting lots of music or videos on it, being able to add a 32GB memory card is going to be helpful.The one big benefit that the Nexus has is that it comes with Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) out of the box. I'm hopeful that my Galaxy Tab will eventually get 4.1 (it came with 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich), but it's no guarantee. But even with 4.0, the interface looks great and is speedy and responsive.As for the Galaxy Tab itself, it's been an outstanding device. It comes with great apps, easily integrates with the Google Play store, and easily syncs up with both my Yahoo and Google accounts. Web browsing is great, and the few games I've installed have worked perfectly. A video chat I tried with Google Hangouts worked seamlessly. I even recently tried the audio input (you talk, it types what you say) and was surprised at how well it worked.Unfortunately, it won't let you print to anything but a Samsung printer - so I have to go back to my main computer in order to print an e-mail or a map.Overall, a great tablet that I would recommend.

tablet_galaxy_tab|It can't be compared to an amazon Kindle or Nook. It has to be compared to any full size, full price tablet on the market right now, and I have to say it's incredible! The touchscreen works great, it is really responsive and the grease marks are not that apparent. Also the screen has a great viewing angle and the image is crisp and bright (although i haven't used it under direct sunlight). The user interface is easy to use and I only noticed any real lag when downloading and installing several apps at once. The GPS works great, but as said on other reviews, it works better when you have an active Wifi connection. The TV remote app works great and it was a breeze to set up, all in all its a fun function to play around with. I also have some sections in my house where Wifi is not as reliable, but the tab managed to get a lock and stay connected so I'm impressed with the antenna. The audio from the speakers is surprisingly loud although not that crisp. Also the option of having two cameras is great! As expected the front camera isn't that great but for video chatting it's just what you need and the back camera is better than the one I have on my phone so I'm happy with that. I haven't tested bluetooth or the headphone jack, but I expect they will work great. Finally for the specs you get the price is unbeatable!

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is the first tablet I've owned, and overall i really like it. I already have a Galaxy S2, so I'm a fan of Samsung and the Galaxy series. The tab has a quick response, smooth transitions from screen to screen. Apps all load pretty quickly, and downloads are fast also. The camera is pretty low quality, but i can use my 8mp camera on my phone so i don't mind. I have yet to video chat on this, so i can't comment on the front-facing camera yet.The battery seems long to me, but i only use this tablet at home when i have wi-fi, and my phone all day at work, so its not being used by me for 8hrs straight. I've used it for probably 3 or 4 straight in a day.Since its running ICS, and I've never used a tablet, i had to adjust to the layout, with the commands being in the bottom left, along with the task manager/dropdown menu bar etc. The dedicated screenshot button is completely unnecessary and in the way, but once i was used to it being there it was avoidable.I was very impressed by the inbrowser video playback. Youtube videos and flash were great and smooth. i watched an entire HBO show last night with no problems. Netflix runs smoothly, and so does HuluPlus (thought the Hulu app is not in the market yet).The IR remote is cool, but is really only needed if your feeling lazy, but when you are lazy its cool, and works well.The screen isn't the best, but its nice. Again, its hard for me to be impressed by the screen and cameras since i've experienced the AMOLED screen on my GS2. If it weren't for the larger screen size, i'd be tempted to continue watching video on my phone. But once i buy a microSD card to expand the storage, i think i'll get more use out of this tablet.I have a mac, so in order to transfer files to this tablet, you need to download a program to your computer to sync files, movies, etc. Also, you can only transfer files no larger than 4GB, which was disappointing for me since alot of my movies are HQ blu-rays that are 4.5+GB each. So a microSD card may be a must since large transfer can't be done via USB.Summary: Basically, if you already have a Samsung Galaxy phone (S2, Note, etc) I wouldn't buy this tablet, just because your phone is probably better. But if you have $250 to spend for fun, it's not bad to have. Its good for watching movies in bed, surfing the internet, playing games. Also remember it's running Ice Cream Sandwich, so that could be incentive to buy for alot of people who want to play with the new OS.it isn't a bad tablet for the price, and is definitely a great choice for a first time tablet buyer who wants something entry-level.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I owned a 10.1 in galaxy tab for almost a year and ipad 2 the same period of time. I strayed from the apple (i-Shackle) product because I hate being told what form factors I NEED to buy or use to obtain seamless transfer.To the 1 star due to seeing it had a proprietary port LOL yes lets give an item 1 star for that. Lots of companies are going this route because it helps in the development of far more future upgrades. The vast array of connectors gives developers more options on what they can come up with. i.e dock stations with keyboard and mouse. Yes a usb also can but since 2.0 has a VERY limited power source and a tiny contact patch it makes for pathetically slow connections when using something with multiple inputs. Say keyboard dock with mouse pad, 2 attached usb devices to the dock etc.To the other 1 star review who likes gingerbread more, stick with the old form factor. Ice cream sandwich (ICS) aka android 4.0 is brand spanking new. When Gingerbread was first released we had to hustle to make all of our apps compatible. I have had no such problems with mine and I'm sorry you did.Remember this is not a PRIME class device. You want that then by all means go buy a Transformer Prime. This is the 1 and only (until later this year with the asus/nexus google branded tablet) 7" device by a major manufacturer to compete in this very low price category. For the price of one 10.1 inch high end tablet or Ipad you can get 2 of these.The device is very snappy. I love android 4.0 ICS and look forward to the slew of improvements samsung will inevitably make. Camera isn't the greatest so just use your cell phone which I'm sure has a better one. I don't know why you would rather turn on a tablet to take a picture instead of yanking out your cell anyway. Screen is very bright. Though not 1280x800 like I wish it was reading is still very easy on the eyes. The screens touch response is PHENOMENAL. IPAD level response, it's so very nice to have.7" is the perfect size for us personally. If I want larger I use my laptop at home. The remote control feature is an A+ extra.1 CON - The moment your fingers or hand touch the back the WIFI drops 1 signal bar. Consistently and always. Same deal that the iphone 4 suffered. I use mine in a case so it doesn't happen to me but it is a definite note to take. HEAR THAT SAMSUNG PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM FOR THOSE WHO WILL INEVITABLY COMPLAIN AND GIVE IT 1 STAR BECAUSE OF IT.I whole heartily disagree with people giving 1 or 2 stars to an item when they don't like one, two, or even three things about it. Remember you are buying a $250 full feature tablet. The very same features you are paying $200 for when you buy your cell phone but without a 2 year contract.Android phone users (baring htc and Motorola i believe) download FoxFi app from the marketplace and turn your phone into a wifi hotspot for free. Internet for your tablet anywhere you go. Just mind those data charges if you aren't with sprints unlimited plans for some reason. I hope this review was helpful.(update 3 months later)We love this tablet. Again it's worth noting that without a cover/case on it your fingers contact with the back drops the wifi signal 1-2 points. 4.0.4 update was received over the air this morning. The fact that it has a microSD card memory slot is a huge perk over the nexus 7. I had been waiting to purchase the nexus 7. However with only 16gb available with the high end one, it doesn't seem enough. With media for the kids alone it's almost full. We love this tablet and my 2.5 year old has already figured it out. If that doesn't tell you how easy it is I don't know what will. Definitely a Samsung family now.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I was excited about it for the first few weeks, but I've run into a number of limitations that have me questioning this purchase:I can't move Apps to the SD card. While the box says it's an 8GB device, expandable with an SD Card (32 GB) the reality is different. 4GB are available to use, the other 4 held by the OS. 4 GB might be a lot for some, but try installing a few Gameloft Games, and suddenly you are out of space with no option to move the data over to the SD card. What's the point of a 32GB SD card? Photos? Unfortunately, that doesn't really work either. Photos taken with the camera seem to show up on the SD card, but if you use any fancy Apps for taking or editing pictures, they are on the device - not the SD card. Photos downloaded from Flickr or Picassa using different Gallery Apps also stay on the device. After syncing a gallery app with Flickr, my device was full again.I cannot mount this device to either of my computers. They both run variations of Ubuntu (Linux) but this device will not mount no matter what I try (and I've tried lots of options offered by the internet). I've downloaded drivers for the MTS mounting system, switched USB debugging on and off, and tried connecting it as a camera. No dice. Can't connect. Can't transfer files. My 2 year old Android phone and my iPod touch both connect and transfer files to the same computers with no hassles!If I try to just plug the SD card into my computer and manually add music and videos, I get all sorts of errors trying to write to the card. Plug it into the tablet, and they're not there. In fact, the only thing on the SD card is a DCIM folder with pictures from the default camera app, and LOST.DIR. No other folders can be added. No other folders exist on the card. the 32 GB card is completely empty but for a dozen pictures yet the device itself is full.I bought this device for the smaller form factor and to avoid the Apple walled garden, but it seems just as bad (if not worse) on the Samsung side of the fence. Booo. I'm going to have to jailbreak this thing and start over. I can't believe I have to jailbreak an Android device to make it connect to a Ubuntu computer. So much for open!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased the wifi first. Love this tab, but when I bought the 4g for internet, I was shipped a Verizon tab. I have at&t. Sending back for return, but be aware. This is a Verizon product. This needs to be added to the product description instead of question marks...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was our 4th tablet. 2 iPods and one pipo. This is a GREAT tablet. I prefer it over our iPads. The screen is great. Almost on par with the iPad yet costs half the price. I would highly recommend this tablet. Save your money from an ipad and get a great tablet at half the price.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I chose the rating cause my tablet is wonderful I dont dislike anything will reccommend it to anyone its amazing

tablet_galaxy_tab|I was going to buy the Kindle Fire or the Kindle Fire HD but when I looked at the regular one it didn't seem like you could do much with the background image and so on. I'm not sure about the HD though and also the icons for apps were at the bottom as a scroll and it was just all too weird, I was looking for something similar to a smartphone really and I totally found it with this tablet. I'm so happy with this tablet it's unbelievable. I get download apps very easily from the Android market and transfer files from my pc as well. It's also quite easy to use and easy to upgrade. I wish I'd gotten a bigger memory though. I think I need for the internal memory to be at least 16gb and then expand it. This tablet is simply amazing.

tablet_galaxy_tab|i love it that is all, it is amazing and i can use it everywhere i go i can also manage my xfinity from it which i loooove so much i recommend this product highly

tablet_galaxy_tab|Here in brief is the Kindle HD vs Samsung Tab2 Comparison.I bought this Samsung after a lot of thinking about maybe getting a new Kindle HD where the Samsung seemed to be a little better and after few days of use here is my thoughts:Comparisons between Samsung Tab and Kindle Fire HD:1- Kindle has a better and friendlier User Interface than the Samsung, specially for Novices and Kids. Easier Navigation and switching between apps.2- Kindle has a more sensitive and receptive touchscreen, it seems that I have to push the screen several times sometimes for the Samsung to respond.3- Samsung have a better App Store(Google) compared to the Amazon.4- Samsung can have a SD drive added.5- Samsung has back and Front Camera, Kindle just front.6- Samsung has less memory(8GB, 4.5 usable), Kindle starts with 16GB.7- Kindle processor is 1.2G while the Samsung is only 1GHz.8- Samsung seems to get a little sluggish at times specially when opening several apps in a row where never had that issue with the kindle, maybe because the kindle will not allow apps to continue running in background after closing them.9- Seems that the battery life is a little better with the Kindle.10- Kindle does not come with a charger(Ridiculous!) and alot of complaints of ads while using Kindle.11- Amazon customer service is superb, I don't think anyone beats them.12- Samsung has GPS, not the kindle.13- Kindle has hDMI output, not the Samsung.14- Samsung measured usable Ram is around 700MB and not 1GB.15- Same Price.16- Amazon Video Library and access is great, Parental control is great. Don't think Samsung has a Parental control and still haven't used their video library and to see if u can download bought movies to watch later?!17- Samsung options and settings are more versatile and editable for the experienced than the Kindle.18- Battery life is worse for the Samsung compared to kindle, 6 hours on continuous use.19- Samsung Tab Glass is NOT Gorrila Glass, Broke after a drop, Kindle took alot more beating and no scratch.So far, Seems the Kindle might have been a better option but not sure, I'll keep the Samsung for now and update this review as things change.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I picked up the Tab 2 at Walmart a few weeks ago since the PX (Air Force exchange) here in town was sold out. The extended warrently at Walmart was MUCH cheaper than Best Buy. We bought our daughter a Nook Tablet for Christmas which she enjoys, but is locked into B&N's limited OS. For the same money we spent on her Nook, I have Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS). The screen resolution is very nice, and important for my "older" eyes ;-) I enjoy having a choice of e-readers to use and have so far prefer the Kindle books on Amazon. I love Amazon for their super-saver-shipping and their gracious handling of my recent returns!! The battery isn't perfect, and I too miss the simplicity of a micro-USB port, but the tablet looks great, handles crisply, light weight, fits in my purse, I installed a 32gig MicroSD card to store movies, ebooks and music, and the price-point was just right for my budget. Oh, FYI...if you are looking for a cover I should tell you that several of the Kindle Fire covers fit wonderfully. I picked up a Belkin cover for the Fire that allows me to prop it (built-in easle) in landscape mode for movies and reading. Another nice surprise was that all APPS I have on my Android phone will load on the tablet at no extra cost...hurray!! ICS can run phone and tablet apps. Apparently Honeycomb can only run tablet apps.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Samsung has won over yet another satisfied customer! I am absolutely in love with my tablet! I will never buy an apple product again :D The tablet is cute, functional, sleek and fits in my purse. My only complaint is the size of the digital keyboard T___T The keyboard is really small :( BUUUUT the positive aspects out weigh the negative and make the tablet worth purchasing! THANK YOU SAMSUNG!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have owned several Android tablets but this is my first running 4.0. The OS is so intuitive and runs very well on this device. The option for expandable storage via SDHC card cannot be overstated. It is such a marvelous thing to have a card for movies and a card for my day-to-day things like music separately.I don't understand why some users are complaining about the battery as it is one thing that I have been most impressed by. I use the device quite often and never have to charge it more than once every other day.The form factor is marvelous and it really makes it a pivotal piece of my morning commute and is less onerous to drag around than my Transformer.The device has been a delight and the freedom of Android is really marvelous with regards to operating efficiently on a tablet.Thanks Samsung!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I admit I am a techno freak. I've tried using a couple of other devices (Chromebook, iPad, etc.) before landing this device, and it blows the doors off all of them. This thing is just plain FUN to use, and it does everything and more than I want it to do. Being a heavy Google Apps user, and deep into cloud applications, the more I use it the more I find uses for it. Some of the apps I have installed include Citrix Receiver for login to my most used cloud app (Thomson Reuters SaaS), A1 Keyboard Plus, Chrome to Phone, File Manager HD, Flipboard (very cool), GrooveIP, Kayak, NOAA weather, Open Table, Play Music, Sports Tracker, Spotify, Spotimote, Xfinity TV, Zinio. Plus, lots and lots of games. Out of the 5gb of included storage, I still have 3gb left. Plus, I installed a 32gb microSD card, but I'm not sure yet when I'll need it. My home screen shows me my Gmail account, Google Voice, Drive, and Calendar, plus six more of my most used apps. The only app that doesn't want to work for me is the Peel remote control, but I'm working on getting that going, it would be great, if it worked. With GrooveIP I can use it to make outgoing calls over wifi. The 7" size makes it great to use while eating breakfast, or in bed or on the couch. It even fits in my pocket. Battery life is great, and the screen is more than enough for my needs. At times, it will bog down a little, but I find restarting it fixes that issue. The volume can be way louder than I need it to be. Screen brightness is best left on manual, and it gets brighter than looking at the sun. The five home screens hold a lot of icons, and I have one I haven't even started to fill yet. The widgets are useful, as well. I highly recommend this product, and the Amazon price and shipping are awesome. For $250, it's the best deal out there. I love my Tab 2 7.0, and I feel sorry for my old Android phone now. It just pales in comparison.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Let me start this review by saying i'm a Kindle lover! i read a lot and for me the best ereader on the market is the kindle, that being said, i needed a change, and at first i looked at...what else...the Kindle Fire...but the lack of expandable memory kept me back...that for me was the deal breaker with this tablet, the fact that i can expand my memory up to 32gigs is awesome!!!! so now i can load my movies...books..images...etc...i've heard people talking about issues with the wifi, i have not experienced this, in fact mine have been been pretty constant, people are also having issues with the fact that it's not possible to store apps on the external sd card, i choose not to make that a problem, as the price point more than makes up for that....netflix streams seamlessly....movie playback is great...i've transferred my books from my kindle to my tab and its perfect....my son loaded a few games and according to him game play is awesome....my advice to you is this....if you are in the market for a tablet that's easy on your pocket whilst being great in all other areas...you cannot possible go wrong with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0......

tablet_galaxy_tab|I received this tablet yesterday. Already have a Xoom wifi tablet which has served me well for almost a year now. I traveled internationally only with the Xoom last year to Japan, Singapore, and India. This worked out very well for me and meant that my bag dedicated to laptop and electronics was suddenly much lighter. I plan on using the Galaxy Tab 2 for every day use like editing documents, writing email, viewing websites, watching movies on netflix.I found the tablet to be very responsive and installed all the applications I wanted but this is where I take one star away and only give 4. If you have an investment in some HD tablet applications like quickoffice HD the market, play store, whatever will claim the device is not compatible. You can install the "phone" version with no problems. I believe that this is because of the display size primarily but if someone knows more, please let me know here.Getting ICS by default is nice and means you can get the thing up and running as you want and not sit through updates at first. This makes a very nice difference on these tablets especially. I believe that this form factor is the future for tablets. The Google Nexus tablet will probably come in at this size and we'll see new tablets I believe through this year stress-testing this size.Finally, the tablet has a very nice feel in the hands and the screen is quite nice and fresh. Installing wallpaper does not result in the usual "cropping" requirements.I was never tempted in the final analysis to buy the Kindle Fire or this tablet. I view the Kindle Fire as a "Amazon Experience" device only. If all you want is that content, by all means get one. I want one that is expandable, has the market/play store on it, can do more tasks and be a light-weight companion when I do travel. I think traveling with this little slate will be quite enjoyable. If you journey forth for pleasure, try doing it with no laptop and using a tablet. Along with the games, wifi connectivity, bluetooth, etc; I'm sold.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Have had the galaxy tab 2 7.0 for less than 24 hours but in setting it up and using some apps and features for a couple hours I must say this is a neat device. For twice the money you could have a better screen, but the response on the screen is good and the audio is surprisingly good for its size.I hope the ex SD problem gets ironed out. That seems to be an issue for many people. I have a lot of Apps on board and still plenty of room. Otherwise it seems you must load music and movies on to the ext card yourself.Some apps aren't ready for the tablet size which surprises me as they have had a bit of time to set it up.The big difference between the ipad environment and the android world is the involvement you have with android devices. I like that a lot, some may be smarter to stay with the apple experience. I have both a ipod and ipad which I enjoy, but I like android more than apple though you can't argue with the apple business plan. 35,000 iphones a week, amazing commerce. Oh not to forget this Samsung product is made in South Korea, not at the Foxconn city in China... Personally a good thing for me.I have to add that I have found that the clarity of video playback is different with different apps. The native video player doesn't seem to be as clear as Meridian. After using this tablet for the weekend I can affirm that for the price it is an exceptional deal. As an e-reader, web surfer, video player, music player it does it all and you can multitask with it as well. I have had no problem with WiFi and Bluetooth, they both stay on and provide decent coverage through the house and yard There is plenty of room for apps in the available 4 Gb, more would be nice but Samsung was going after the Kindle with this so they made calculated decisions to keep the price as low as possible. The 7" form factor is very usable, I would be very surprised if the Apple people do not put out a 7" tablet, as they like having a share of everything...Well, it looks like Apple is going to produce a smaller tablet so my above prediction is correct so far.I use this tablet daily and enjoy it a lot. It lags sometimes and some apps force close but overall it works. I mostly stream audio on the tune-in app and listen to music and audio books. I have expanded the memory with a 32 GB card and am very happy with it. I keep saying a couple of generations down the line tablets will be a fantastic universal item for everyone's every day use.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have a week with this tablet.I use Sketchbook app, and it sucks on the Galaxy Tab 2. It's not responsive enough, I try drawing a straight line with my finger and it only comes a wavy line. It's not smooth. And with it a Stylus, forget it....cut lines and wavy. Even the Kindle Fire is better for drawing.Another thing, many apps are not supported for this tablet. Even when apps say they are supported, at the end you find out they are not supported. I went on Google Play and saw a check that Adrenaline 6 game was supported for this tablet, I downloaded it and waited for all the files to download. Then, it didn't work and I had to request for a refund. Something about the Kindle Fire is that all the Apps on Amazon Appstore are supported for the Kindle Fire.If you have a Mac, it would not be easy using Android File Transfer program to transfer your files. I can't create folders, rename files, etc. I have to use a MicroSD Adapter, that way I can connect it to the computer without using Android File Transfer.Cameras suck, but I am glad they are included though.I like that it has bluetooth, I can connect it with my wireless speaker and mac keyboard. I bought a 32GB MicroSD to transfer some of my files (Movies, Books, and Music).*This is not a perfect tablet, but I am fine with it. I wanted it to use it more for web browsing, watch my videos, and read books while on the go. I didn't want a iPad, too big. This is the right size for me. *** If a smaller iPad comes out, I might get it. Maybe

tablet_galaxy_tab|I didn't order this product from Amazon, but from Verizon. I am very impressed with everything about it. It's fast, the clearity is amazing, and the start up is fast too. I read some reviews that said this tablet is slow and kicks them off the internet or freezes. Well I haven't experienced any of that happening.All I can say is be the judge for yourself. I'd recommend this tablet to anyone.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Great size tablet that does everything and easily fits in my purse. It is a little on the slippery side and I purchased a Moko slim fit cover/stand to address that. After receiving items I realized I badly needed a screen protector and 32GB micro sd card which I purchased later at Best Buy (where they installed a screen protector with a lifetime warranty on the Samsung Tablet). I wish I would've thought of these items when making my purchase on Amazon because I paid DOUBLE for the items @ Best Buy.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Pros- Great form factor. Easy to carry and hold in one hand for extended periods of time.- Excellent resolution for reading newspapers/books, listening to podcasts or watching downloaded movies.- Battery charge is great - gives me about 6 hours of reading time.Neutral- Samsung's Kies application is a good first attempt to access your tablet from a browser on your PC - similar to how you control IPad through ITunes. One big limitation is it does not let you manage your apps (add, delete, move screens, etc).- Pairs nicely with other samsung products - Blue Ray player, TV - but works mostly as a remote.Cons- You can spend money and buy an SD-Card but you can't really use it with this tablet. There is no way to move apps from internal memory to SD-Card, download videos directly on your tab to the external SD-Card. What's the point of the Lobotomized SD-Card then? Nice design decision, Samsung. Kudos to the product manager.Recommendations to Samsung- Allow the external SD-Card to be used as an extension of internal storage.- Allow watching whatever is on your screen on the tablet on TV or Blue Ray player. Extend the interaction between the products. Will be great if that's done as an app/firmware update on Samsung devices - wishful thinking?

tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this item from Crutchfield but decided to review it on Amazon since more people would probably see it. There were many who said this would be a bad purchase with the Google Nexus 7 being released. The Nexus 7 is a nice tablet and trumps the Tab in screen resolution and processor power. But neither the Nexus 7 nor Amazon's Fire appeals to me, and many others, because they lack a micro-SD storage slot and support for USB host mode (also called USB On The Go). The lack of a storage slot alone is a deal killer for me. And since I use the tablet to control my Canon T1i using a very cool Android app called DSLR Controller, the USB OTG function is important also. Though no match for the Nexus 7 in resolution, the Tab's screen is very nice and the dual core processor is very peppy. HD videos play beautifully with MX Player. I also installed GPS Test from the Google Play Store and the Tab picked up more than a dozen satellites inside my home under a metal roof and got a position fix in seconds. So it should be a fine GPS navigation device with the appropriate software. I could go on about how well it runs other apps I've installed, but the point of this review is mostly to disabuse potential buyers of the notion that this tablet has become completely obsolete because of the Nexus 7. It's still a bargain and for some of us a better choice than the Nexus 7. I love the size, features, and performance. You can safely make a buying decision based on your particular needs.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is the my 1st experince with a Samsung product and Android OS. I bought this device for a larger screen than my ipod, but samller than 10 in. I watch embedded news vidoes online a lot. Compared to my ipod, this device is less responsive, and occasionally freezes at webpages while my ipod and laptop do not do the same on the same spot. At first, I thought the particular device I bought was defective, and requested for a replacement. But the second one is only a little bit better. One review at techradar I bumped into after I bought the device tells exactly what I've experienced, so I quote it here:"The sensitivity of the display was lower than we expected, and we found it hard to register presses on small parts of the browser, such as links, and the close tab button.While watching embedded video, skipping and scrubbing through the movie was a challenge, due to the lack of response."In addition, I've found that some embedded videos become visible only on a full-screen mode. I love my ipod and still prefer to watch news from my ipod than this device.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have owned and used several android tablets and I have to say that this is a really nice buy for your money. I currently own the ASUS transformer T101 and was looking for a smaller screen size that still has Ice Cream Sandwich. I needed the device to be able to stream movies over my network at home or on the go, and let me VPN to my work site and monitor equipment. The Galaxy does both with ease, and is just the right size to take with me to lunch and catch up on the news with Pulse or Newsreader. Compared to a Fire or a Nook Tablet this thing just blows them out of the water. This is not Android with a locked down interface thrown on top....this is pure ICS goodness with a few Samsung touches that can be bypassed with ease. What that really means is that you can customize the tablet to fit your needs. Example: Don't like the built in browser? Install Dolphin and enjoy fast tabbed browsing. Don't like the built in Samsung Music Player? Install Google Music, Rhapsody, TuneIn radio or any other player no questions asked. Add Kindle and Nook apps and you are good for reading, and apps like PlayOn let you watch Amazon video and Hulu on the go. You can do some of these things with Fires and Nooks, but you can do all of them with the Galaxy. Add a 15 dollar 32G Mini-SD card and you have plenty of room for your stuff. I even like the TV app. So check this Tab out, you won't be disappointed.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I've owned an Ipad 2, a Kindle Fire and now the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.I personally feel that Ipad's are overpriced and a little too bulky for taking anywhere outside of the house.I thought the Fire was okay for the price but you're very limited to Amazon's media library, they make it difficult to get anything from The Play Store, there's no camera, no bluetooth, etc.So for $50 more this is a no-brainer.I love the new version of Android, it's snappy, fast and does everything I need it to do.The size is perfect for taking it on the go, it's the size of a book, I take it to the doctors office and it's easy to travel with. The screen is also big enough to easily enjoy browsing the web or watching movies on.I have to do a lot of writing for work, and when I'm on the go it's a lot more convenient than a laptop. I bought a blue-tooth keyboard for it, downloaded the free app Kingsoft Office and it's just as easy to write on as a PC.The camera's aren't the best, but do the job for Skype and everyday use.The battery life is great, seems to be around 6 hours of constant use.Love the fact that you can plug in SD cards, giving you 32gb of storage.All in all, surprisingly great quality for the price. I've had it for about a month now, use it daily and have nothing bad to say about it. I bought one for my Mom on Mother's day, she's loving it too.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I was in the market for a tablet for my son. I was considering the Kindle Fire, but then saw the Samsung Tab 2. This is a much more versatile tablet. Looking at the specs, the two are very competitive. However, on closer inspection, the Tab 2 came out the winner. And here's why:- The Samsung Tab 2 has upgradable storage. I can add up to a 32 GB micro SD card to the Samsung. The Kindle is not upgradable.- The Samsung Tab 2 has both a front and rear facing camera. If all you want to do is Skype, then the front-facing camera is fine, but if you want to take pictures using the Kindle, good luck.- The Samsung uses Android Ice Cream Sandwich, and I prefer it to the Kindle's UI. The Kindle seems to use Android apps, but these must be purchased through Amazon's front end. I guess I prefer the versatility of the Samsung App store and Google Play.- The Samsung uses a "standard" tablet UI environment. This is a minor point, but I like the thought of my son getting used to a more conventional UI, as it will prepare him to use a real tablet in a real world. He's growing up in a world where tablets are commonplace tools. If he learns how to navigate and organize his day using a standard tool, he will be better prepared in tomorrow's world. Again... a small point, but an important one.Cons:The Sammy DOES have a proprietary charger as opposed to USB (This is where the Kindle wins). For this reason, I cannot give the Sammy a full 5 stars.The Sammy also lacks the app time-out feature of the Kindle, which lets parents set time limits on some apps. This is easily accomplished using apps on Google Play, however.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first "mobile smart" electronic device. I bought it as a treat for myself without expectations of it being really usefull. I was wrong. I keep it next to my tv/reading chair and whenever I need to check something on the internet it is right next to me. No need to get up and head over to the desk with my main computer setting on it and waiting for it to awaken. I also consolidated all my little to-do lists and reminders, appointments, work hours, etc and everything is in one spot. I also enjoy many of my favorite games and it is a good combination of size and portability. It took me a while to get used to the Android operating system but now that I am comfortable with it it works great. The Galaxy Tab 7 is quick, clear, and has worked flawlessly in the month I have owned it. I would have no qualms about recommending this device to anyone.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I really do enjoy my Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 - The tablet was at a great price, it is fast and is well built - however, there are some quirks and some Samsung-isms that detract from what is overall a very nice 7" tablet. I'll try to be brief but thorough, scroll to the bottom for the cliff-notes.::Hardware::Processor: Dual 1.0ghz - Pretty standard for 2012, zippy for most things but not record breakingRam: 1gb - Again, pretty standard for ICS in a middle price point device; fine for 99% of tasksScreen: 1024x600 WSVGA - Gorgeous. Samsung makes pretty screens and good hardware.microSD: Accepts microSDHC (Up to 32gb of external storage) They use a dumb mnt name though ...microUSB: NONE (Samsung! What were you thinking!)miniHDMI: NONE (Samsung!! Seriously!!)30 Pin Proprietary Port: Yup. Instead of industry standard ports Samsung saddles this device with a 30 Pin port (*cough Apple rip-off cough*) You will be stuck with Samsung brand cables and accessories. I don't know why companies think that proprietary ports are a good idea ... whatever.Camera: 8mp Rear / 3mp Front. They are decent but only really useful for Skype and video chat. Taking pictures on a Tablet is awkward and there is no flash.IR Blaster: You can control your TV (I had wondered where this feature went 7 years ago when it disappeared from devices. I'm glad it's back, it is by no means life changing but it is fun.)Speakers: Better than I had expected, but unfortunately they are located on the bottom so when you play games or watch movies in landscape the stereo experience is lost. Also, if you have big hands and hold it from the right your hand covers the speakers muffling the sound. Oh well.Audio out: Headphones work. The jack is a little tight so you worry about breaking it the first time ... but it works fine.Bluetooth: Works great. Keyboards, mice, gamepads, etc. Go nuts.Battery Life: Much better than I had expected. It generally lasts a whole day even with heavy use. It lasts longer if I am just checking the web and email occasionally. It won't last much longer than 3 days on light to moderate use.Connectivity: I bought the WiFi only model and it connects well to a Wireless B/G/N router.Bezel / Case: The device is well built and does not feel flimsy. It has a little weight to it, but the appearance is very slick and attractive. Occasionally, because I have big thumbs, I accidentally touch the screen when holding the device one handed. I suppose someone with smaller thumbs would not have this problem. (Thumb-ectomy?)::Software::OS: Ice Cream Sandwich is awesome. Google made some great improvements with this release of Android and it is much more polished than Honeycomb .... unfortunately Samsung has included some "Customization" and several of the Android menus are truncated and some options are missing. (Mostly things like Themes.) I guess this is leftovers from the "Touch Wiz" era. This is too bad really, because on a stock build the device would probably run a little faster and have some more UI options. Samsung ... STOP IT!Pre-Loaded Apps: This is the part of the review that makes me sad. Samsung really does make gorgeous hardware, but their software is kinda crap. They have pre-installed the Samsung Media Hub, custom gallery and calendar apps, and a slew of other Samsung branded "Features". Most of them work o.k. but you can't get rid of them and they don't really add anything to the Android experience. I wish manufacturers would stop trying to provide "extra content". As usual the Samsung Experience apps are protected and cannot be removed without rooting. You can however hide them in the app drawer so you don't have to look at them and most of them do not automatically load into memory unless you tell them to. More or less I find they just take up space. The Galaxy also comes with the standard Google apps pre-loaded. The new Ice Cream Sandwitch email app works so much better than the Gingerbread/Honeycomb one and Gmail's App is much improved as well. Also, Google Chrome is available for Ice Cream Sandwich. It works well and syncs all of your bookmarks from your desktop browser if you let it.::Summary::Great price, nice hardware. Runs most apps flawlessly. (High end emulators will have to accept some frame skipping to get past the standard processor.) If you like spending extra money on proprietary cables, there are a slew of accessories from the Galaxy Tab 1 7.0 that will work fine with this.Hardware - 5/5 (*For this price point)Software - 3/5 (*Ugh! Samsung warez!)Galaxy 2 7.0 vs. Kindle Fire = Buy this tablet! It crushes the Fire in processing and overall user experience.Galaxy 2 7.0 vs. Nexus 7 = Hmm ... depends on how important microSD is to you. Probably get the Nexus 7.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Let me start this review by saying that I do own a "New" Ipad. I do love the Ipad I wanted a smaller tablet, something that I could put into my pocket if possible, but something smaller and easier to transport.The pros:The 7" screen my not be "HD" but it you would not know that unless someone told you that. The images are very sharp. I like that I can change memory cards so I can have tons of video or pictures. Basically I'm only limited to how many and the size of the memory cards I own. This is very light.Cons:While I can change the memory card when I want to, I do have a hard time sometimes getting the memory card out of the tablet. It's supposed to work on the push the memory card in and it pops out just a little so you can grab it. I have a hard time with this, sometimes. For this reason only I have to give it 4 stars because it really does bother me.In conclusion you can't go wrong with this 7" tablet. It does everything I could possible want a tablet to do, all you need is a little patience when it comes to changing memory cards.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great tablet. For $250, you will not find a better deal. I have tried the Kindle Fire and the Nook Tablet, and the restrictions in the OS make them fall short compared to the Galaxy Tab 2. Ice Cream Sandwich is sleek, quickly to respond, and very customizable. The best Android OS out there so far, without doubt! I dare to say it's even more customizable than OS X / OS 5 in some aspects. There are numerous apps and it allows for third party apps to be installed as well.One of the silly things I care about is wallpaper customization and the sorts, and I was disappointed that Kindle Fire didn't allow for that. This tablet, however, is super customizable as far as those things go.The size is perfect. I don't care for the 10inch displays of the iPad. I wanted something I could hold in my hands, put in a purse and carry around without having to worry with its size. Display resolution is great. I couldn't tell the difference between it and the Fire. I haven't tried the IR or bluetooth functions yet, but I'm still playing with it. Yes it has a proprietary cable, but seriously, what doesn't these days? Also, the camera resolution is not that great, but I'm not going around carrying a tablet to use the camera. I am photographer so that's the last thing on my mind when I shopped for a tablet. It's okay for the occasional snapshot, but if you want superb pictures, get a decent camera or pay extra for a tablet with good camera. Can't have it all man, but this tablet is an absolute bang for the buck!

tablet_galaxy_tab|Pros:Ice Cream SandwichCompatible with phone appsGreat parter for aldiko reading appLow price pointDisplay takes away from the soso pixel densityVery sleekLots of cases available for it, as all galaxy tab plus cases fit it nicelyHas a cameraEasy to useMicro SD expandale up to 32 GBSmall bezel, portableNot that laggyAbility to hide bloatware from applications menuCons:Horrible wifi reception (on mine at least, returning it for a new one)Landscape apps look sort of stretched out because of the tall screen and the menu on the bottom always being thereAbout the WiFi thing... my tab cannot connect to wifi unless it's in the same room as the router and if it does, it keeps connecting and disconnecting. It's not my wifi network because it's like this on every network I've tried so far, and my friend, who tried it on the same networks, had no problems.

tablet_galaxy_tab|After 3 weeks, the screen went completely dark. I've gone to online chat rooms for help and I see that this problem is disturbingly common.I can't just go to online service and support because it keeps telling me that my serial number is not valid!!!One LiveChat session with their "support" folks revealed that I had to do a factory reboot: a complete re-set that wiped anything I'd loaded onto the little devil completely clean.That doesn't fix the problem so it is going back to Samsung (assuming they follow up on my request for service this time). They say that if they cannot fix it, they will send me a refurbished unit!!It went bad in no time at all, and they won't replace it with a new one?? I highly recommend that nobody waste their time and money on this defect.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I wasn't sure about this tablet when I first ordered it because I was so used to my iPad. To my surprise, I was very pleased with my new galaxy tab 2. I really got all the same features with this tablet plus more than I had with theiPad. I wad really tired of having to do everything through itunes. Now, I can upload, delete, backup, and add without worrying about having to hook up top another computer. Life us so much easier!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I thought that the product was great because it was limitless, but I recently found out that this is not the case. I bought the 8Gb drive expecting to use the external drive once I filled the internal drive, but this is not the case. To start out with half of the 8Gb is taken up by the tablets firmware and bloatware. That leaves a piddly 4Gb to use for apps. From what I have gleaned from my research and talking to Samsung, Samsung has disabled the ability to move your apps to the SD card. So, if you buy and download apps, which I guess you would because that is what Droid is about, you will NOT want to purchase this product. From my experience apps that you cannot move include: games, apps that use the internet for push updates, and apps that download offline content (some of mine are close to 1Gb by themselves). I would not recommend this product. If you are going to be limited by Samsung and have to store all of your content on the internal drive, you might as well get an iPad. The features are great, the speed is great,and the definition is great.Samsung's customer service will not do anything for you if you are unhappy with their product. You cannot leave a negative product review on their website either. They say that it goes against their posting rules, but it doesn't. I have submitted two product reviews tailored to their posting requirements and both were unjustly rejected. DO NOT trust their rating on Samsung.com because it is engineered by Samsung to falsely give a better impression about their products than it should. You cannot even give feedback about their poor customer worth because they say that they "appreciate your aggravation and are sorry for the inconvenience, but there is nothing they can do to help" me. Pay the extra money, get an American engineered product, a better supported product, and a more secure product. I wont be purchasing another Samsung product again. I am done with them.

tablet_galaxy_tab|After doing literally days worth of research on tablets within my budget, it came down to the Kindle Fire, B&N Nook, Blackberry Playbook, and this device. All retailing for less than $300, but after reviewing the specs of the aforementioned devices over and over, and watching many Youtube video's, and reading countless posts and discussions on this device I went ahead and pre-ordered it. First off, I tip my hat to Amazon, who got this sexy piece of technology to me a mere day after it's release (keep up the good work guys). Now on to the review.Right out of the box, I love the way this device feels in my hand. It just cradles my hands perfectly, and has a nice weight to it, and the materials to me, feel like quality stuff. Upon fully charging it, I did the initial setup, and then proceeded to download all of the apps I would need on this device (SBM, Quickpic,Camera ZOOM FX, Aldiko, Rage of Bahamut, A Comic viewer, Evernote, etc.). After testing all of them under various conditions, I am very pleased with the performance the tab offers. There was no noticeable lag or performance issues at all in starting, using, or playing any of my favorite apps. The TouchWiz interface blends nearly seamlessly into ICS, and I for one like the the way Samsung integrated the two interfaces. The capacitive screen is very responsive, and I had zero problems using SBM on this device to keep my many invention ideas drawn and saved for further refinement. Speaking of which, the screen is gorgeous at 1024 x 600, and while not the highest end screen out, is simply stunning for the price range. I tested a variety of HD videos, and all of them ran without a single hiccup in the frame rate, and had all had bright crisp pictures, and awesome sound quality (the speaker was far better than I expected it to be). Watching the HD quality video of One Ok Rock Live at Shinjiku Loft was truly awesome on this screen, and didn't stutter a single bit.Regarding reading e-books, it housed, ran, and performed far above my expectations, and I found myself reading in a variety of lighting conditions, in all of which it functioned perfectly as an e-reader. Haven't tested the camera's yet, or Poweramp, or some of the more advanced features yet but I'll update this review once I get a chance to play with them a bit more. Oh, and lest I forget, the battery life on this bad girl is beyond sweet. Since my initial charge, and using it moderately to heavily for three days, I haven't hit 60% of the battery use yet. Also a quick note for those wondering about cases, the device fits in my Navitech case like a glove, with none of the buttons or ports being blocked (besides the rear camera of course). So far, after testing all of the aforementioned tablets, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is serious contender with all of them, especially the Kindle Fire. For only an extra $50 you get expandable memory up to 32GB (a huge plus in my book), two cameras, ICS without the need to root anything, full access to Google Play, and more. Unless you're a serious power user this tablet is more than capable of handing most anything you throw at it. While a bit of a downgrade from it's Samsung siblings, for the price you currently won't find a better tablet.UPDATE 4-26-2012: Been using the Peel remote app with the built in IR blaster for over a day now and to say I'm impressed would be an understatement. I have a brokSonic TV that I use for television watching, as well as my PC monitor. While the input (i.e. switching from HDMI, to coaxial/TV, to component, etc.) is not supported by the app, it more than meets my needs. Turns my TV on in the morning, and is able to switch channels on my Comcast DTA. Now for those of you who have Comcast and a DTA (the small smartphone sized box like device), you know that there is no guide for us. And this is where Peel, and the IR Blaster captured my heart, as not only does is function as smart remote, but also has an awesome program guide built into the app. So now I can see what is on TV at any given time and allow me to instantly switch to the channel. This functions either automatically by clicking the Watch on TV button under the show currently on, or if like me and the app seems to want to double down on numbers (i.e. changing to channel 33 instead of 3) can be done manually by pressing the appropriate channel button in the upper right hand corner. A very minor annoyance, but considering me not having to give Comcast $9 a month more just for the privilege of having a guide, I give the IR Blaster, and Peel remote app, two huge thumbs up.UPDATE 4-30-2012: Poweramp works like a champ on this tablet. The sounds while not mind blowing, are crip, with good lows, mids, and highs. The bass is more than sufficient for listening to music through the speakers, but as always if I need deeper richer sound I just plug in my JBud J3's and enjoy my tunes.UPDATE 6-6-2012: Finally got the Poetic case for this tablet, and got a chance to take come videos and pictures with the rear camera. While I wouldn't substitute this for my DSLR (obviously I guess lol), it works awesome as a standard point and shoot camera and camcorder, taking pictures in surprisingly great quality. Also I wanted to note that in bright light, watching videos with any dark scenes is difficult, but it's not so big an issue as to take away from all of the awesome positives.

tablet_galaxy_tab|In reviewing my Galaxy Tab 2 I compare it to my iPad 2, which is less than a year old, because like it or not, iPad is the gold standard of tablets. I was actually going to wait for the 2nd generation Kindle in hopes that it would include a memory card slot. It didn't take long to fill up 16GB on my iPad so I wasn't going to downgrade when I got a 7" device. But I have to thank Amazon for setting the price bar for 7" devices to a more affordable level. At $249 for a tablet with 8GB and memory card up to 32GB, on a 2nd generation device, the Galaxy Tab 2 is the best buy out there right now.The Tab 2 is slightly thicker than the iPad2, which, being 2nd generation, disappointed me. But at 7" in size, it was still light weigh and didn't bother me a lot. Like the iPad, the Tab 2 starts immediately. I found my finger does not slide across the screen on the Tab as smoothly as on the iPad. Finger prints are also a lot more difficult to wipe off on the Tab. Scrolling on the iPad is also a smooth fluid motion where the Tab 2 is a jerky movement. However, if you've never seen a iPad, I doubt you'd notice. Where Samsung succeeds is in just offering 7" as an option. Steve Jobs was wrong when he said no one would want a 7" tablet. I find myself using it more than the full size iPad. The Android store is also easier to search than the iTunes store, which brings up so many Asian language apps that I waste a lot of time trying to find things. But one of the best things about the Galaxy Tab is that it is a standalone device. The iPad must be connected to a PC for setup and updates. The Galaxy does not require that. Samsung Kies software is available if you want a PC interface but I was never able to get it to work on the PC or the Kies software for the Tab.It seems Samsung does not offer mobile broadband with this device, unlike the earlier 7" Tabs. That's too bad. I know people who would get one if it did.As you can see by my 5 start rating, any fault I find with the Tab, doesn't really bother me a lot. Overall, I think the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 this is the best of the 7" tablets out there today.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I own a IPhone since they have came out. And I was going to purchase the iPad until I had talked to some friends they said hey try the Samsung Galaxy 2 you will be surprised and happy and you will save a few hundred dollars.Well I took a mental note from my friends and still needed more proof due to being a true iPhone/Apple fan.Well I was watching all the commercials a bit more and reading the reviews and then I went to YouTube and watched Samsung Tab 2 videos well I must say I was sold!I purchased from Amazon for 199.00 and received the next day. I'm not lying if I say I opened the box and turned on and located my WiFi and within 5 minutes I was up and going!I love it and I have been playing with it since I cannot stress enough how pleased I am and I'm going to keep it.Lisa

tablet_galaxy_tab|I'd wanted a 7" iPad. I had a first generation iPad and it was just too big and heavy for my intended use. I tried the Kindle Fire, found it lacking out of the box because it doesn't do well with Gmail and Google Calendar. I rooted the Kindle Fire, tried Cyanogenmod 7 and 9, and it still wasn't great for me.Enter the Galaxy Tab 2 7". It's lovely hardware, significantly lighter than the Fire. With bluetooth, which the Fire lacks, it plays very nicely through my Creative D100 bluetooth speakers. And it is much more satisfactory than the rooted and modded Fire--recent OS, and much fewer bugs than the unofficial Cyanogenmod ports (blessings to all the devs at Cyanogenmod and XDA!)The Tab operating system, Ice Cream Sandwich, is sleek, smooth and attractive. Although there are far fewer apps than for the iPad, my needs are met well. I really like the voice dictation and command interface that is very well integrated into the apps. Too, I'm using the SlideIt keyboard, available through the app store--much better than the stock keyboard IMO (and one of the reasons that in this instance I prefer Android to IOS since Apple doesn't make this kind of Swype-like input available in such a well-integrated manner).Other reviewers have commented on the pros and the cons. I'll just add that while there are compromises compared to, say, the iPad 3, the compromises are reasonable and don't affect my enjoyment of the device.It may be that new tablets such as the vaunted Google tablet will provide more bang per buck. But at the moment, the Galaxy Tab 2 7" provides plenty of bang, with a fluid and enjoyable user experience for this size of tablet. Glad I got it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I waffled around for quite some time before deciding to grab a Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. After all, I had my laptop for gaming, my netbook for traveling ... WHY did I need another computer like 'toy'???From the minute it arrived and I put it on the charger, I could not resist playing around with it to see exactly what it could do. I explored the app store, which previously was only available to me on my phone, and poked around in the games, something I'd not bothered with on my phone, due to the small screen. What a MOST pleasant surprise it was to be able to sit and enjoy games, looking around on the internet, or reading (I transferred some of my Kindle content to my Tab). The light weight of this Tab is easy on the hands/wrists, even for extended periods of time. It can snap a quick picture if I need to, check my email, allow me to browse the web for something that pops into mind, and get some of my favorite phone apps as well. I became an instant fan!My hubby, who is not tech minded, saw me playing with it and commented it looked like fun. First time I got a chance, I purchased another for him - which he is enjoying greatly. The great thing about this Tab is: it's designed for easy accessibility, and you don't have to understand a lot about tech to fully enjoy it. It makes his little handheld individual games obsolete, and he is really having a great time playing old favorites, as well as trying out a few new ones. Since he has now retired, it will be something he can really enjoy using any time of the day.The slim size of this Tab allows me to take it AND my Kindle when I'm out somewhere I know I'll have to be waiting. Best of both worlds, in a convenient size ... I'm in heaven!! If you are waffling about getting one of these little gems ... grab it now! You won't be sorry!!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm sure none of you need a 492nd opinion (as of this writing) but I am so impressed by this tablet, I feel compelled to write about it. I should point out that I bought this elsewhere (sorry Amazon - it was easier to return if I didn't like it and it was less expensive) and it's the Student Edition, which includes a USB link and an attachable keyboard. Both are great and I highly recommend this edition if you can find it.I agonized comparing this to the Fire HD and Nexus 7. Recognizing each has pluses and minuses, I finally made the plunge with the Galaxy Tab and am glad I did. It is everything I wanted in a tabletTo put my review in perspective, I didn't want a tablet for playing games, viewing movies, listening to music, or mainly shopping. I wanted a lightweight piece of hardware that would allow me to access the internet, as well as maintain my calendar, contacts, to-do lists, and other general "workhorse" tasks. The Galaxy Tab does all of this amazingly and as I've found, far more.The Good:1. It has the best calendar program I've ever used (including Palm, Apple, Google).2. The display, though less than its competition, is clear and adequate for my purposes.3. Battery life has been great, and I've been putting it through its paces. As other reviewers note, you have to be mindful of what's running. The Tab allows killing programs easily, turning WiFi and Bluetooth on and off quickly, and generally tweaking to your heart's content.4. Navigation is fantastic and fully customizable.5. Touch is for the most part, responsive (see below for so-so.)6. It has voice dictation that is highly accurate and makes composing emails, searches, etc. very easy. It's not perfect but then again, neither is Dragon.7. WiFi performance has been excellent. I'm not sure why some reviewers have had problems but I haven't. At home, on the train, and at work, this has picked up, identified, and connected quickly, and maintained the connection even with weak signals.8. The customizable universal remote is FANTASTIC. I am having so much fun with it. It's not perfect but it's good enough.9. I was worried about performance given that the processor is lower speed than its competition and only dual core. Also, this is the older version of the Android OS. My fears were unfounded. This has performed quickly and responsively with everything I've thrown at it, including real multi-tasking.10. The USB dongle included in this edition is also great. I've moved files and so far, avoided having to get a micro-SD card.11. Though I keep thinking I should have gone for the 16 GB version, so far, I haven't eaten away that much of the storage. And I see the micro-SD as a solution should I need more.12. I've accessed my entire Kindle library and the entire Android market with ease. The Tab holds its own to the competition.13. Internet usage is smooth, fast, and I haven't experienced any clipping.14. It reads and allows editing of MS Office products admirably, as well as reading pdf's.The So-So:1. Touch response is usually fast but sometimes lags. I've found that sometimes it's because my other hand is overlying the screen somewhat, but there are occasions where I have to keep tapping.2. The feel of the screen is dampened by a plastic overlay, so this lacks the smoothness of moving your fingers over true glass.3. The overlay is a true fingerprint magnet.4. The camera isn't that great (haven't used it for Skype yet) but this isn't what I want in a tablet anyway.5. No manual on the device. I personally don't tend to read them and enjoy finding my way around hardware and software but others might be daunted. The manual is available on Samsung's website (and other reviewers have given links in this forum) but it would have been nice if they had included it.The Bad:1. As others have noted, placement of some icons, and particularly with the keyboard, are awkward. I've taken too many screenshots with the camera than I care to admit.2. Syncing software with their calendar and Outlook proper (not Exchange) would be great but is absent. There are low cost options in the Android market but then you lose Galaxy's wonderful calendar (I think - I haven't bought any syncing software yet.)With this market, the Galaxy Tab is fast becoming "old" but I think it is a very viable choice. My review may be too late to the party, but I'm so in love with it, I thought it proper to put it in writing.UPDATE 10-18-2012Still loving it. Maybe even more. My two "Bad" comments above have been addressed. Taking inadvertent pics with the camera from the bottom screen has been fixed as you can program that area to do other things. And Samsung's own "Kies" software syncs its wonderful calendar with Outlook!This tablet is the very productivity pad I wanted. With free android apps like Evernote, I'm able to keep my personal and professional life well-organized. The only hiccup I've experienced is that it sometimes chokes a little on large pdf's (such as the electronic manual to this). But other pdf's don't faze it at all.Oh, and for me, the battery life is great. But I practice conservation: shutting down apps I'm not using, turning off wifi when in sleep mode, etc..

tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm very happy with this tablet. I had every intention of buying an iPad 2 but played with this tablet in the store and thought I would give it a try. I'm very impressed and saved $100 to $150 bucks. The user interface Samsung laid on top of Android 4.0 is excellent. The screen is responsive. Syncing with Gmail and Google Calendar is perfect. To my eyes the screen looks better than its specs. The Wi-Fi signal seems consistent and strong. Definitely worth a try.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have been using the tablet for about a month now. I ordered both the playbook and the tab since their specs are very similar. I liked the Tab for reasons mentioned below and returned the Playbook after a week. I'm quite happy with it's performance, if not mind blown. Its definitely worth the money I paid but I still see a lot of scope for improvement.Form factor: The biggest pro for the Tab I'd say is the weight. Even without getting into the specifics of the OS the Tab wins hands down compared to the Playbook given its much lighter build and better screen. The Playbook has a much solid build and the rubber finish on its back feels much better in your hands but it's a little too heavy for comfort.Display: Speaking of the screen, the 1024x 600 display is vibrant and sharp. One of the best ones out there. It a joy to watch HD videos on this baby. The display is definitely much sharper than the Playbook. The auto brightness wouldn't work properly out of the box - the screen was always way too dim. But I got an over-the-air update 2 weeks after the release date and it's working fine now. I haven't noticed any other changes from the software update.Battery: The battery is also good. This is my first tablet so I don't really know how long these things are expected to last. Checking my email 3-4times a day and about an hour of browsing/video means I need to charge it once every 90hours. Reading books with the display inverted (white letters on a black page) means you can go for two days without having to recharge.Keyboard: One of the best things about a 7" tablet is you can type with two hands in portrait mode as if it were a smart phone. The stock keyboard is really miserable though. It's extremely slow and the auto correct behaves like a 5year old baby. I use the free version of GO keyboard and it's just brilliant. If not for this I'd have returned the Tab. There's a bug in the software that doesn't allow you to move the cursor to the second last line when composing email - which leaves some unnecessary space between the content and my signature. And removing the two extra lines takes more time than writing out the entire email since the keyboard doesn't have arrow keys. If you use the Tab for writing emails a lot you'll find this really frustrating. God bless Go keyboard! It is not only much faster and has a better layout, it has a better auto-correct (though not as good as that of iOS) and the much needed arrow keys.Speakers: The speakers are loud and clear, with two separate speakers at the bottom. This however is a bad design - putting both the speakers next to one another. Isn't the whole point of stereo having one on each side? Unless you're holding the tab upside down in portrait mode you're blocking one or both speakers. The playbook does a much better job here with two front facing speakers. No wonder playing NFS on the Playbook gets your adrenaline going. The Tab on the other hand doesn't even have a supported version of NFS. Blah!OS: This is my first Android device. And I'm pretty satisfied with the performance. The device is responsive and navigation is fairly intuitive. The device does slow down after continued usage though and a quick reboot brings it back to pace. Roughly 600MB of RAM is under use all the time - I'm not sure what causes the slowdown. I wish there were something like a favorites menu to access the most frequently used apps without having to put them on one of the home screen. The Playbook OS 2.0 is clean and minimalistic and does the job. But if you want to go beyond just emails and work, you would want to choose an Android or iOS device. One of my main reasons for choosing the Tab over the Playbook was the android eco-system.Email: The default email client is buggy (like I mentioned before). The mail widget seldom doesn't respond when you click on unread emails. You have to open your inbox and then open the unread mail. The unread mail count on the email icon doesn't update when you've read your email, which is also really nagging. The Playbook has a much better email client; that's BB's home ground after all!Music Player: Nothing out of ordinary. You can scroll down easily by the letters on the right side column for songs/artists only, but not for albums. I don't know why. The music player widget is convenient way to accessing your music player but the playlist always scrolls back to the top. This is really irritating when you have a long playlist with hundreds of songs and have to scroll down each time.Really smooth with docs. Renders pdfs superfast, even the bulky ones with thousands of pages. I'm a grad student and this was my main reason behind getting the Tab.I could go on and on. But I've hopefully touched base on the most important points.tldr; The Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 still has a few kinks but it's the best 7inch tablet available in the market as of now if you're looking for a tablet for more than just reading. If its ebooks you're after you might as well stick the Kindle.

tablet_galaxy_tab|All I can say is wow!! This is a amazing product. I was told its like a ipad, it really is just more afforable. I havent ran into a app I cant download yet either. Awesome! I love the touch screen. Even with a screen protector its a easy touch. It does everything I need it too. Wifi on this thing picks up great, I can sit in my car outside a bit from the house and still have wifi. My phone doesnt even do that and its new too. I dont have one complaint about this, its perfect size. You might think its small since they have a 10inch option also but this just fits in the hands perfectly. I love it. Its a great choice, you wont regret it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I almost returned this. I got it for the IR remote, which turns out to be a waste of time. The provided free remote is very limited. The play store remote is very very very expensive. I used the trial, and found out the database is limited. Most of the devices I needed to control by IR are NOT in their database. But I would not pay the fifty bucks for it anyway,,,,,,the better remote app should be under $20. There seem to be only two remote apps for it, the provided one for free, and the squid one...which is too expensive, and as I said, limited in database/devices.The IR feature problem, and the proprietary cable connector took off one star. I would give it three stars but it is such a good value, I gave it four stars.Setup was frustrating at first.1) Be careful about getting the Samsung account. I did not get the registration email. Their system is not capable for correcting this. I had to create another gmail account to use it.2) Of course, you need a gmail account with payment method attached if you want to use the play store.3) Don't bother using the amazon app store, as you need to install the app store app to use anything you bought on the amazon store. Just use play store.4) Tech support is outsourced out of USA and is totally useless, I found. It should get one star less for the crummy ignorant and arrogant support, but that is the way of the world for an international company like Samsung.5) Most apps I use run fine. Dish, Squeezebox, Kindle reader, cool reader, and many more.6) Video app built in is better than most.7) DOes NOT seem to support flash, and I could not get it to load.8) Works well with the Pogoplug home device. This allows you to stream video and must, as well as see files on pogoplug device in your home network. Pogoplug app seems to be ok. TO stream video you must "optimize" video on the pogoplug (it does that itself, but is VERY slow). Once the pogoplug optimizes the video, it will play on the Galaxy fine. You can get pogoplug cloud storage too, cheap, and have all your stuff in the cloud if you can;'t get to your home network stuff.9) Video and audio quality during playback are fine.10) Touch screen is very sensitive, but good.11) You can get spare cables from amazon. Including a cable that converts to female usb connector. I think you might be able to use usb flash drives with this.12)Many cases or covers available.13) Battery life is ok. Depends maily on running apps that constantly stay on to access network stuff. You need a task killer to effectively kill these when not really using them.Overall for the price, an excellent value. Worth the extra bucks over the cheaper nasty tablets.Recommended, overall.

tablet_galaxy_tab|You run the risk of finding out exactly why it was returned to be refurbished in the first place. I have no need to return it as it works 89% of the time. Just had some issues with the video display a few times. Turning it off and turning it back on seemed to work.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first personal tablet. Have really enjoyed it. Worked great, very fast.I play games, email, web browsing, and Netflix on it. All work well.Also, the one I received actually came with Android 4.1(Jelly Bean) as the OS.The only drawback I can think of is that the power/data cable that comes with it is rather short. It's about 2-3 ft. Had to buy a longer one for my own comfort of using while charging.Battery life has been ok, But it won't last all day if you're using it for most of the day.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is great! It comes preloaded with so much stuff. The HD quality is amazing to say the least. No problems here.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Personally I prefer e-ink Kindle 3 (aka Kindle keyboard), which I have for 1.5 years, but in two weeks after release of Kindle Fire I bought it too, because my son, who is medical student, wanted something compact to read his color textbooks. I'm not a fan of gadgets, at least I do not like to have more than really necessary, but I'm quite experienced with them and my friends bring them to me to set up very often. So, I played a lot with different Android phones and tablets as well as with different IOS ones, like iphones, Ipods and Ipads. I do like Apple products quality, IQ and interface but for me they look like handicapped ones comparing to Android devices - no USB host and memory extension, limited number of supported file types, need of iTunes to copy files (no chance to download anything from other computer without it when you are travelling), so sometimes it is even not a lack of features, it is lack of freedom. Actually it relates to Kindle Fire in some aspects, too )))Anyway, I wouldn't buy this tablet, but I'm going for vacation and it seems that it will be necessary not only check my e-mails, but to read some documents and to answer, my smarphone is not very convenient for this and I do not want to carry my 13" laptop, so I decided to give this tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, WiFi, 8Gb) a try. I played with it for two days and may say the following:GOODScreen: Excellent. Very similar to Kindle Fire, though of different type, probably viewing angles are a bit different, but anyway very good and comfortable screen for reading, browsing and watching movies.Battery: Excellent. I fully charged it and it worked for 10 hours 43 minutes during two days, when I checked it yesterday (there is a battery meter in the Settings). Today it worked for about 20 min and switched off completely at 5%. I think that 11 hour is very good for first cycle of charging, usually it became a little better (10-15%) after 3-4 cycles of training. This 11 hours were active browsing, downloading applications, reset to factory defaults, WiFi was on 80% of time, screen brightness - 30-40%, manual. Overnight it eats 2-3% in sleep mode, so the battery is really good. UPDATE for battery - the battery meter shows the time from the last charge of the tablet. Mine restarted after reset to defaults, but anyway, its estimated work time was more than 10 hours, it's why I desided it shows real operation time.OS: Good. I did not notice any significant difference in speed and touch sensitivity over regular Cyanogens, Kindle or IOS, but I'm tolerable enough to some delays. Actually, after initial set up we do not work with OS, we work with applications and widgets, so I do not care what type of OS is hidden behind, as soon as it is stable. And I do not care if it requires 10 sec to find an icon and to start application, if after that it works okay without lags for hour.10 sec may kill some guys, but I usually survive. But it is not the case, Tab 2 OS is intuitive and responsive. The only thing I did not like - it is impossible to set two and more languages in Samsung keyboard, so I had to install additional keyboard. Well, it is stupid, any Samsung Android smartphone has this feature.Applications. It seems that many applications are not optimized for ICS. I live in different country, but I usually set US as home country for the devices bought here - sometimes it helps to avoid stupid software limitations. But Skype could not be downloaded from Google Play, it told it is not available for my country. Probably they track IP, but even the version, downloaded from 1mobile market told that the device is not yet certified for it. Anyway, Skype works perfectly.Quality: Good. It seems that it is assembled very well. A bit plastic, of course, but I put it into Roocase leather case immediately and now who cares what is inside?WiFi: Good. No problems with connection to office, home, and restaurant WiFi networks.BADNo external LED battery indicator. Or it is hidden somewhere inside the case, but all the other buttons and connections are accessible. So you have no idea, if it is plugged in, is it charging or not and is it charged completely before you switch it on. Not very convenient. Sometimes you even could not see on screen battery indicator when the device is charging and off. And charging time is very long - at least 5 hours (from 5 to 100%). But its because of good battery )))Proprietary cable. Well, it would be probably okay, but supplied cable is very short, it seems it will be very difficult to handle device when it is charging.In general, very good tablet. I'm not going to use it for a long time, and after I'll be back from this travel, I'll give it to my son to replace Kindle Fire, which he will sell to his mates. At least it's what I recommended to him, though he likes his Fire and have laptop for any serious work. I'd recommend this tablet to anyone who wants good multimedia device. Frankly, all this stuff, including Ipads and other 10" tablets, is mostly for entertainment, if you want to DO anything, regular cheap netbook is better.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I was wide open to any tablet on the market when I started looking. I was open to iPads, Galaxy Tabs, Thrives, Nook, Fire, Sony's tab, Asus's tab, etc...I ruled out the Nook and Fire for their locked ecosystem.I went to best buy, and ruled out a good number of tablets based on their responsiveness and ease of use. I was left choosing between the Galaxy 10.1, Galaxy 2 7.0, Galaxy 7+, or iPad.I thought I was going to end up choosing a 10 inch tablet, but when I went to Best Buy and held the tablets, I realized 7 inches is more than enough for most tasks. So it was between 7+ or Tab 2 7.0.I'm cheap, so I went with the Tab 2.@Pros: Very responsive UI Android 4.0 Runs games fairly well Plays movies very, very well (including netflix, or those on sd card) Camera on front and back (back camera is not bad) Has external microSD card slot Peel SmartRemote stuff@Cons: !!Fairly small internal memory, and it's difficult to move things back and forth Not top-of-the-line hardware A little bit of bloatware@I use the tab for a few things, for which it is perfect:- SmartRemote that knows when my favorite shows are coming on, and I can actually switch to them with the tab (the app isn't perfect, and I haven't found a better one, yet)- Quick games- Checking email- Quick SSH sessions for checking disk usage and things- Reading online documentation- Small edits of MS Office docs- Looking up something on IMDB quickly- Watching a 20 minute show in bed on Netflix (it's the perfect size for 2 people to watch a short show on without arms getting tired)- Skype works better than my computer- It's okay for watching something longer (and it plays it very well off of external microsd cards)@There are a few tasks it's not great at, that I occasionally use it for:- Note taking- Using Citrix to do database work (if there's a tablet that did this really well, I would be all over it)

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have been using a Kindle Fire since it came out, but was wanting a more full featured 7" tablet. I also have a iPad but due to its size I find that I rarely take it with me, the 7" form factor is far more portable. So, I began exploring the idea of the B&N Nook and then rooting it to use the latest version of Android on it, ICS. Then I read about this tablet. For only $250 it is shocking how much you get. GPS (yes, even without the cellular radio), front and back cameras (not the best quality but good enough for video chat). Dual Core 1ghz processor and 8GB of internal memory plus a microSD card slot.This beats any other tablet in the price range. If you are looking for a full featured 7" tablet this is the one to get. You can access the Google Play store, the Amazon App Store and use it to read all of your Kindle books or B&N books, so you don't need to be locked into one vendor for your eBooks or Apps.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This Tablet is great for me. I was going to buy the iPad3 but didn't want to spend the money. I already own a Mac laptop. Also, I wanted something small to carry and it was mainly going to be used for reading. I played around with the Nook and Fire but I liked the idea of adding memory and its more than a reader . The screen is clean and crisp without glare. Easy to hold in one hand and no extra weight added to my bag. No problem with WiFi. I love and use Swype on this machine. Great tablet .

tablet_galaxy_tab|I buy, learn to use and then mostly resell tablets after I learned about them. Not this one. I've had several 7 inch tablets. Kindle, Nexus, etc.. This little guy with only 8 GB of ram blew them all away for practicality. Drop in a 32 GB Card and you've got a great 7-inch! It's user friendly and running Android 4 Ice Cream Sandwich. I haven't found anything on Play Store I can't run. My favourite is &#34; Air Calc&#34; because you can run it along with any other program or browser (at the same time). Great for doing your online banking! I have the 10&#34; model of this too. I might sell it too! This little guy you just grab and go! I have it in a leather case with no screen saver, and other than wiping the screen off every once in a while, and using an alcohol pad once a week, I don't have any scratches even though most of the time I mistreat it badly! I got mine before the Christmas shopping began for $179. This is by far my favourite Android machine. I use it as much as my iPads. Why? It's cheap. I couldn't afford another iPad if I screwed one off them up, I probably could this! Buy this! If you have any regrets, I'd sure like to hear about them!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I am truly overwhelmed by this tablet. I purchased this to replace my aging Palm Pilot. I primarily use this tablet to organize all of my work files and it is turnng out to be a great tool.I transferred all of my notes from my Palm consisting of nearly 500 procedures. The transfer was tedious and required beaming them to a laptop with an IR beam. I then dragged and dropped the individual procedures from the laptop to the tablet. The tablet has Polaris Office which easily converted the imported text files and stored them in the Memo tool.I imported my contacts in a similar fashion. All but a handful were successfully added to the tablet without having to re-enter them by hand. I also dragged and dropped my photos and MP3's from the Palm to the tablet via the SD memory chip.I had numerous HanDBase databases on the Palm that I transferred by saving them to the Palm's SD memory chip. Then I transferred the databases from the memory chip to the tablet. Fortunately HanDBase has an Android version of their database program and I was able to start using my databases in minutes. HanDBase is so much easier to use on the tablet.Lastly, I opted to enter my calendar appointments by hand to the S Planner.In all, the process of transferring my information from the Palm to the tablet was painless. I now have all of my information on a much better tool and the wifi capabilities is icing on the cake. By the way, I have found the wifi to perform better than expected. I have wireless devices that do not work on the third floor of my house but this tablet works flawlessly. The GPS and mapping features are awesome. I have several GPS devices that range in price and I am really amazed at the precision and effectiveness of the built-in GPS. The battery life is very good if you don't over do it with the wifi or GPS. I usually get 7 days of battery life if I don't use the power hungry wifi/GPS. If I sparingly use the wifi/GPS then I can expect 2-3 days of usage. I have owned this tablet for 3 weeks now and I am still finding better ways to utilize it and it has been a great companion at work.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I had begun to be interested in the world of tablets, and I started to look for a small, budget conscious device, and I found the Galaxy Tab 2 7 Inch, and I am pretty astounded by the quality and value of this device, it does not mimic the cheapness found in similar tablets of this price range, with a highly responsive screen, full Android 4.0, and a good build. Also being a 7 inch device it is very easy to hold with one hand, and it is very light, it is definitely a good choice for those who are on the move often. The device is not perfect though, with a few hiccups.PerformanceThe device responds quickly to commands, plays media flawlessly, and runs every app without incident, but after a week of using the device, there was an odd slow down of the home screen that occurred for about 5 minutes, I did not get the issue again since, that is the only issue I have had with the performance. I think it was the stock TouchWiz interface, I have since switched to GOLauncher, it's great.Battery LifeThe battery life is great so far, after being charged to 100% I got 2 days of use without charging, tasks on the device included a little web browsing, browsing and installing apps, and some video/picture taking.NetworkingThe device is WiFi only; I have had no issues with it, reception is no different than the other WiFi devices in my household.InterfaceThe device uses Samsung's TouchWiz interface; which to my guess is a modified 4.0 interface, it is a nice interface, without lag, but the lock screen seems a little boring, I will probably look into using the default 4.0 interface, or something else.ScreenThe screen is very good in my opinion, it displays content nicely, and it is very responsive. There have been a few instances where I have sworn I tapped the screen and nothing happened, it could be my error, or the device's.AudioThe device features two speakers at the bottom of the device, which sound nice but are not the best I have ever heard. The microphone is located at the top of the device near the 3.5 mm headphone jack, from a little use of the Google voice command feature, I have found no issues.CamerasThe device features a front and rear camera, the rear camera is 3 MP which takes decent photos, while the front camera is a VGA camera that is good for video chat, it is no SLR camera, but has good cameras.PortsThe Tab 2 features a 3.5mm headphone jack at the top, Micro SD slot with door, proprietary Samsung USB port at the bottom. The most interesting is a built in IR Blaster located on the right side, which is supposed to be used with the included Peel Remote app ( I had to manually update the app before being able to use it) which worked very well with controlling my devices (LCD TV, Sony Surround system, Comcast DVR). My only true gripe is the lack of a Micro USB or micro HDMI port to be used with projecting content onto a TV screen, one must purchase Samsung's adapter to do so.ButtonsThe Tab 2 features only 2 buttons, which are located on the right side of the device, the first button is the usual lock/wake button, and a volume up/down button, I would of liked to see a Home button, but the 4.0 interface takes care of that.Build QualityThe Tab 2 has a solid hard plastic build, the back of the device features a soft metal like shell that feels good when held.Pre-installed AppsThis is one of my gripes with the Tab 2, the device comes pre-installed with a suite of bloatware, that cannot be installed as far as I have discovered, I prefer the default Android apps, with apps I choose to install. It does come with some useful apps such as Netflix and Kindle bookstore.Overall, it is a fantastic device, with a few hiccups that may only bother a select group of users, being a first time owner, I cannot compare this tablets to others personally.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I recently bought a new iPad for my wife, so I thought I would also like a tablet for myself. I commute on a train and thought the 7 inch size would be just right. I initially bought a ZTE tablet from Spring. It was ok, but with the cell bill would equal $580 for the two year contract. No Go.Then I bought this Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. I love Android on my phone, so I wanted the continuity onto my tablet. ICS on this tablet did not have the wow factor that I envisioned. Also, the processor is weak for a brand new product. Then there was the crappy camera... my 3 year old phone was way better... The nail in the coffin was that I could not watch MLB games using my MLB At Bat account. Something else I can do on my 3 year old Android phone. On top of that, the Samsung apps are by and large horrible.The whole time I was using these tablets I kept looking at my wife and her new iPad... and I was envious. Everything was smooth. Everything (but Flash) works. And the new display is incredible. So, I did the obvious...This is a great tablet for a newcomer to the tablet scene who has never touched an iPad and does not do heavy processing... Not a bad product for $250, but not great.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have been holding off buying a tablet for years now. The Ipad, Motorola Xoom, and others are great. But, in my opinion, they are not worth the $500+ price tag, especially if you already own a good smartphone and laptop. So, i tried this, and am very impressed. It's a full featured Android tablet, unlike anything previously in this price range. Ideally it would have a bigger screen, but i think that is probably impossible at anywhere near this price range. There are plenty of reviews on sites like CNET that give accurate descriptions of the strengths and weaknesses of this tablet. I think they are accurate. You are making some tradeoffs for the price, but in my opinion they are completely worth it. One of the cameras is lower quality, but the other one is great. The internal memory is small, but you can add a micro SD card, so no big deal. The tradeoffs are 100% worth it given the price savings. At the end of the day, if you want a "real" tablet, and do not think it's worth $500+, this is the perfect solution.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have been looking at tablets for a little over a month to fill the void between my phone and laptop. For me this was the right choice. It does everything I need it to do without the cost or bulk of a 10" device. I have been using it practically nonstop for the 4 days since it arrived. The battery life is reasonable and everything just plain works. There are several reviews that report a lot of problems, I just haven't had that experience. Love it!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have honestly tried to think of something that I dislike or am disappointed with about this tablet, but I honestly can't think of any. It has met all of my expectations and then some. I would recommend this tablet to anyone who is looking to purchase. Battery life is excellent with a bit of tweaking I easily get 4 hours on a charge.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'll admit that I didn't really need a tablet - but I was using my phone more and more often to check email and try to browse the web - which, let's be honest, is not that much fun on a phone. The 7&#34; Tab is perfect, and it's nice not to boot up the laptop every time I want to look something up. I even use the Peel television remote control and program feature, which was pretty easy to set up (and it works with Tivo). I was concerned about the poor wi-fi reported by some users, because I already knew that I had a weak signal in my bedroom (my phone would often not connect via wifi) but a booster solved that problem (Netgear WiFi Booster for Mobile WN1000RP-100NAS)(available on Amazon) and I've had no problems at all.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had this unit for just over two weeks now and have put it through the ringer. I'll make this short and sweet.Pros:Great size. 10" tablets are a bit too much.Extremely solid construction.Camera front and back.SD slot (with restrictions)Great battery life (I was sick one Saturday and it took me 8 hours to drain the battery between Netflix, Comcast on Demand, and web surfing.)Very responsive with zero freeze or crash/resets.Sound is excellent. Even more amazing with good earbuds.The app Peel is a nice remote when it works. 3/5 stars for this preload.Cons:SD slot - You can NOT put your apps onto the memory card. Also, the unit resets to the default of the download from memory card to internal memory from the internet everytime it is turned off. I'm still trying to figure out how to keep the settings like I want them.Flash not available for Android 4.0.x and above. (Please try to download Flash before the ungrade and see if you can hold on to it.)Only Samsung cables and Samsung printers are allowed to interface with it.Too much bloatware that you can not delete, but you can deactivate at least.Amazon does not have an app for movie streaming for android (but they do for iPad?)ios and bloatware eats up HALF of the memory of an 8gig unit.Lack of ability to move pictures and files back and forth from sd card to internal memory and vice versa. I did find an app that did this for me.Summary:Great item. I even purchased a second one for the wife. The best, in my opinion, of the 7" tablets by far. The whole memory/sd card issue and too much proprietary requriements restrict this from being a 5 star deal. The company that comes out with a blank tablet that lives off apps will make the money.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Pros: built-in speakers, bright display, subjectively realistic color, excellent form factor for travel, came with android 4 ics, smooth video playbackCons: un-removable bloatware, unable to move apps or data to external SD card, should come with 16gb internal storage, touchscreen sometimes slow to respond (adding a screen protector makes that worse), battery life with WifI on could be better, shortage of compatible accessories- - - - - - - -I wanted to replace my first-gen iPad with a 7" tablet. My choice came down to this device and the Nexus 7. Samsung won for one simple reason: the micro SD slot. If you have any desire to carry video around to watch where you can't stream, you need storage space.The Gtab is lighter than the iPad -- though hardly lightweight, especially when compared to a Nook Touch -- which makes a difference for extended reading of e-books, or reading while lying down. Being a smaller device, it's also easier to travel with; it doesn't take up as much room in a carry-on and it fits in a coat pocket (or even a cargo pocket in my shorts!). The micro SD card slot means I can carry more videos to watch on a plane, though the battery life for video isn't as long as I'd like. Battery life while streaming Netflix via WiFi is even less; it's good for 2 - 2.5 hours and then it's time to recharge.I don't understand complaints I've read about the screen and its resolution. The screen is bright (turn off the auto brightness adjustment and do it manually), colors look reasonably good, and playback is smooth. Any artifacts I've seen in videos come from the videos themselves, not the screen. It's a 7-inch tablet; how many more pixels do you need?Small speakers don't sound particularly great, but these are at least good enough to let someone else listen with me on occasion. Sound through good headphones is quite good.The Gtab is good for reading, too; the size makes it easier to handle than the iPad. I've had some issues with certain e-books, but they're from the e-book or the reader app, not from the tablet.I'm not happy about the lack of an adapter for video out so I could watch purchased movies/TV shows on my HDTV (although reading elsewhere indicates that you can't port DRMed material on any of the Tab devices to a TV through Samsung's HDMI adapter (which is not compatible with this device)). For that matter, not happy with the custom connector in the first place. A mini- or micro-USB connector would have made life easier all the way 'round. There also appears to be no docking station of any kind that's compatible with this particular device. (Seriously, Samsung? You have other tablets with the same type of connector, but you changed the pin-outs or something on THIS device so that it can't be used with any of the accessories that work with them?)I'm glad that the Gtab came with Android 4 installed, so I didn't need to wait for an upgrade (the Gtab recently upgraded itself to version 4.0.4). However, I'm not happy that there is so much bloatware preinstalled, and no way to remove it without rooting the tablet. I also dislike the fact that there is no way to move apps -- or data that they download/install -- to the external SD card without rooting the tablet. Some apps can't even see the external card (which, I realize, could be the fault of the app rather than the tablet).Given that Samsung has locked down so many things to internal storage, it would have been nice to have a 16gb device available. I'd have paid an extra $50 for that. Instead, I'll get around to rooting the tablet one of these days so I can ditch stuff I don't use and move data (downloaded videos and books) to external storage. For now, though, the combination of price, usability, and form factor means that I'm fairly happy with the Gtab.Note: If you're switching to the Gtab from an iPad, and want to continue using iTunes for organize your music, get the iSyncr WiFi app. You may have to create special playlists -- iSyncr doesn't support picking & choosing songs/videos, it just grabs the whole playlist -- but this is the best iTunes tool available on Android right now.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I am very happy with my new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.0 - 7". It was reasonably priced and provides what I was looking for to replace my heavy, large laptop. I enjoy watching streaming video movies and my only improvement suggestion would be for the battery to last longer and recharge faster, but this is not a major concern.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great Android tablet, and although the TouchWiz UI that Samsung lays over Android definitely slows things down a bit launcher-wise (the home screens and app drawer are both painfully slow at times), you can always change the launcher to something like Apex or Nova, and that should make things better. It handles games and hd video very well. The cameras are sufficient for a tablet, but certainly nothing special and you can definitely tell that this is where Samsung cut some money out in comparison to the 7.0 Plus. With sub $250 Quad-core 7" tabs on the verge of release, I felt a slight urge to return my Tab 2, but the built-in IR blaster and free Peel remote service really is awesome. I will likely buy the Nexus tablet when it is released and keep this Tab as the coffee table tablet :)

tablet_galaxy_tab|My wife wanted my Kindle Fire so instead of purchasing another I wanted something with a little more. Something with expendable memory, Bluetooth, gps, mic, and camera and this tablet hits on all cylinders. I have a 32.gb micro .sd card in mine loaded with movies, pictures, and music along with documents. Plenty of internal memory for apps and games. The display is excellent, making for excellent video watching, and sound quality is excellent for music as well as movies. There is very little I can't do that I could do with the Kindle namely watching Prime videos and shopping on Amazon is a much better experience with the Kindle Fire. However with this device you overall get much much more for only $50 more than the Kindle.When using this device the drop down menu is actually a pop up menu on the bottom right of the screen for easy and quick access to a quick settings menu including Wifi, screen brightness, sync, GPS, silent mode, screen rotation,Bluetooth , notifications, and ariplane mode. This menu also has a set button for access to the full settings menu and immediate access to the screen brightness control as well as ongoing audio and notification. At the bottom of the screen there is also a button for instant access to mini apps including email, calculator, alarm,music player, planner, world clock,and task manager. These mini apps pull up small windows in the center of the screen that allow quick access to these features without leaving the screen you are working on. There is also an instant screenshot button and a button that pulls up apps that you have previously been working on giving you the ability to quickly return to them.The camera takes excellent photos and videos and the forward facing camera is not all that great but does allow for selfportriats and face time. I personally make VERY little use of the camera but thought it was worth commenting on.The GPS works great, just as it would on a good smart phone although it will not give you driving instructions without wifi.The built in mic allows for use if voice dictation when emailing, writing Amazon reviews etc. I admittedly have very little experience with using this feature.The Bluetooth feature was probably my biggest complaint about the Kindle Fire but this device does make use of it making listening to music untethered a pleasant experience as well as transferring data between bluetooth devices seamless and quick.Web browsing is excellent on this tab, very quick and fit to screen is excellent as although pinch to zoom can sometimes be a little laggy.This device comes with Polaris Office as it's native document program instead of Quick office. I have lots of evperience with DataViz, Quick office, and Office Suite as I read and edit documents on my mobile devices daily and Polaris blows all the other doc readers out of the water with it's (my opinion only) ease of use, and is visually very pleasing. I still use Office Suite some as I am more familiar with it by I expect that will come to an end as I become more familiar with Polaris.The IR blaster was a surprising touch as I can program my tablet to control my TV and other IR devices in multiple rooms. Though there are glitches with the native Samsung app that makes use of the IR abilities it is still very nice.Battery life is one thing I don't complain about vs other reviews. I get a full days use from a single charge, even if I use it a lot, however I keep the screen brightness down and unused features off like GPS, notifications, wifi if not on the net etc. I do the vast majority of my internet surfing from this device as well as TuneIn radio, mp3, Amazon mp3, Rahpsody, and YouTube and get a good 8 hours or more out of the device. I do believe screen brightness and of course streaming video or audio are the major factors when it comes to battery usage.Now, in the spirit of full disclosure I strongly prefer a 7 inch tablet vs a larger tablet. The ONLY thing I like a 10 inch tablet better for is web browsing , though a 7 inch is no slouch in this department. A 7 inch tablet IMO is better for virtually everything else, games, email, video/audio, portability, and especially as an Ereader. The Kindle app for Android allows me to carry all my books very similar to the Kindle Fire.I keep my Galaxy Tab 2 in a Poetic hard cover/stand with camera cutout and the device literally fits in my back pocket making this device truly portable vs, a 10 inch tablet. I use this as my Bible, web surfing device, hand held video game device, mp3 player, video streaming device, (youtube, Netflix, hulu, Crackle, etc) email, doc reader and editor, voice and video caller (when connected to wifi) PDA, and ereader. In the short time I have had this device it has become a "must take with me everywhere I go device".ProsAndroid 4.0Expandable memoryGPSPriceBluetoothMicBattery lifeCamera (rear 8mp camera is excellent, front not that great)Fast and responsivePortablePolaris OfficeFull access to Google Play store, Amazon app store.Syncs to your google account including contact list , Google Docs and calendar.IR blasterQuick access to mini apps and recently used apps.Built in screenshot with instant editorExternal and virtual volume rockerExternal speaker good, not greatConsFinger print magnetSlick in the hand without a coverHome screen takes almost a full side to side swipe in order to switch screensDedicated sync/charge cable instead of the more universal micro USB charger

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have nothing negative to say about this tablet. It may not have the best camera resolution, but that is not the reason why I chose this tab. The convenience of a 7 inch tablet is what I was seeking. I own an iPad but hardly take it out with me because it's like holding a folder. Originally I wanted to wait for the google tablet because of the cheaper price tag, but figured a Samsung tab at this price was as good as it's gonna get for now at least. Since I already own a Galaxy phone, using this tab is a breeze. I'm pretty sure anyone would find this user friendly. I feel confident that this tab will keep me happy for a couple of years until I upgrade and can pass this to someone in my family.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 for a couple of weeks now and so far I like it a lot. It does everything I want it to do and probably stuff I haven't figured out I want to do yet! I will say that all I want to do (right now) with a tablet is be able to load it up with tons of videos, music, books and hidden object games. For what I want it to do this tablet is fabulous. I gave only 4 stars instead of 5 though because I think you should be able to transfer downloaded apps to the sd card. I had a cheap little Pandigital Star before I bought this and you could transfer most apps to the sd card on that so don't understand why on a much nicer tab you can't do that simple thing. I have read that it has something to do with the 4.0 ICS and that eventually it will probably be updated and you will be able to transfer the apps. It doesn't matter that much to me because I don't download hundreds of apps, what I want to put on the sd is videos and music and you can do that so no big deal, it just seemed a bit odd that the apps wouldn't go. I knew that this was the deal before I bought the tablet from reading other reviews though. I knew that the 4GB of storage that was on the tablet after the 4GB the OS takes up would be enough for my app needs. Also I don't give a crap about the camera, but I have tried it out and to me it seems to take decent enough pics. If I want to take a good pic of something I will use my regular camera. The speakers on this tab are AWESOME! I had to put an external speaker on the other tab I had to decently hear videos and music, not so with this one sound is GREAT! I have not had any problems with the wi-fi connection at all as I have seen some other reviewers say. Reading the reviews it seems like people who were connecting to wi-fi with 802.11 n seemed to be the ones having problems. I have 802.11 b/g and have had no problems. Not really sure if that is the truly the case but it seems so from reading tons of reviews. I think the battery life on this tablet is really good. The battery on the Pandigital Star was terrible it is the reason I had to buy another tablet.Will update if I think of anything else or any issues arise but so far I really like my GT2.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have to admit I'm not a big tablet junkie, and this is my first tablet. However, I did find it easy to use. The Ice Cream Sandwich interface is smooth...like a delicious ice cream sandwich. The audio quality on this is good. I normally use a Cowon J3 for portable music listening, but this is almost as a good. Whenever I listen to music with my Westone 2 earphones, I like to bump up the bass slightly along with the clarity. Unlike the Cowon J3, however, the audio quality on this tablet is decent even without EQ. I do recommend messing with the audio settings to get the sound signature you want, though. A lot of people insist on wanting flat EQ because "that's how the music was meant to be heard." This tablet plays .flac files which is a huge plus for me since that's about half of my music library.The other thing I like to use this for is playing games. Angry Birds is so much fun on this thing, and unlike my cell phone, this thing actually has the battery to play for extended periods. I do recommend getting a stylus to fine-tune the angle of bird trajectory especially if you have fat fingers.Some people complained about the resolution not being very high. I don't see a need for it, personally. The screen isn't that big to begin with. The videos I play look fabulous enough as it is.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Short review:Nice screen, halfway decent camera and camcorder (no autofocus, though), and a good size to hold in your hand.However....The Wifi antennae is VERY weak on this device. I use an AT&T Uverse Wifi modem in my house - a very standard unit and one used by a good number of people in my particular area. It's been out a while as well, so is not an odd standard or unknown third-party device. I noticed quickly that I was dropping Skype video calls on my Samsung Tab, then I noticed Netflix movies were buffering, and Youtube videos would do the same, all with me being only two rooms away from my router. Through coworkers, friends, and a neighbor, I have had people come over to my house and test their devices on my Wifi, so we've had a range of Android phones, a couple of iPhones, and one iPad in here trying it out. Everyone averaged around 12-18 Mbps download speeds on their devices, when in my living room, two rooms away from the router. My Samsung Tab barely got one bar of signal, and averaged around .5 to 1.5 Mbps download speeds (if that). Same room, same location in room, etc.There are no updates to the device software. Samsung support ranges from "we're aware of it" to "send it in for repair". I'll be taking it back to where I purchased it as my "repair" - sorry, I'm tired of companies using the public to test their devices before they have. That's my experience, yours may vary.UPDATE (April 2013):Decided to try this again as by now the kinks should have been worked out on newer production stock, so went back to the Big Box store and got one that runs Android 4.1 (instead of the previous unit's 4.0), showing it's an updated model. This time, the WiFi worked *slightly* better with *slightly* better range than the previous unit, this time averaging about 6-8 MPS on average (in a 22 MPS area, however). I noticed that for whatever reason, this unit had more "bloatware" apps installed than my last unit, that cannot be removed, and upon investigation many of them keep trying to kick on constantly even after you disable them (?). Not a deal breaker, but irritating. The "up to 11 hour" battery life is also stretched of course, too - with consistent normal use I'd say it's more like 7 1/2 hours depending on what you're doing.This is app-specific but worth noting too - I tried a very popular scanner app that allows you to create PDF documents of papers you have, and upon installing I was told by it it was not compatible with this device because the Tab 7" only has a 3 megapixel camera on the back, and you really need at least 5 megapixels to be table to clearly scan documents. I know this is specific, but something worth noting, as people do like to get smaller tablets for work uses as well.Overall I upped my rating one star from 2 to 3 but there are still enough quirks and irritations to make me tell someone to look further (maybe a Nexus) unless they are getting one specifically just for very casual uses like Netflix, etc.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Yes it came with jelly bean 4.1.1, even the box still says icecream sandwich but it's not, can't tell the difference because i couldn't use 4.0, but it's fast and responsive as an android tablet should be, now if you came from the ipad then you can tell a difference in smoothness, the ipad is still smoother and more responsive on the fingers, this is slow compared to even the ipad 2 in finger swipe but for the money it's ok. I'm not a reviewer that's gonna bash android, but it still needs some refinement and more responsiveness to the touch, the camera is great for panorama mode on jelly bean 4.1.1, but the 720p video is super grainy i dont recomend video capture neither night or day it's simply awful even for a 3.2 MP camera. To summerise if you want this tablet for the camera then dont do it, get the nexus 7 and get a better powerhouse for your money. Other bad thing about it is the battery life, it takes like 7 hours to fully charge from 1% and it gives you around the day 5 to 6 hours when you use it on power saving mode and auto screen brightness for music and videos which is quite nice.Now the good about this tablet*It does not weight as much as an ipad which for me is great, i hate tablets that break you knuckles.*Memory expansion, you can put up to 32 GB Msd for more videos or music (you can't install apps on the MICROSD, you only get 4GB of space to download apps on the device which is horrible but you get what you pay for)* It's perfect for one hand use if you want to read books and magazines, 7 inches is the perfect tablet, not so big as an ipad mini or ipad and no so small as a laughfable ipod touch.*It does come with bloatware from samsung that cannot be erased but for the first time is bloatware that you can actually enjoy because samsung has refined their apps to really work with the new tab.* it costed 179.00 which is a steal, i was not gonna hand 270 buck's for a a nexus 7 on the net or even 330 for an ipad mini without retina display, apple can stay with their mini ipad, it's not worth it and it's still to big.*The google play store has everything i needed for free when the apple store had me pay for the same apps. If you get apple it's obvious you really want to loose cash on stuff that's free on android no brainer.*The sound it's incredibly loud on the speakers, better clearer then the ipad's.*The resolution 1024x600 is great, i really dont understand how people can see 720p or 1080p on a 7 inch tablet, videos looks incredible on this screen, i really dont understand the nonsense of people wanting HD on a phone or tablet, i do not see a difference between my ipad 4, my samsung S3 and this little guy, for the money you are getting a premium device for a small price tag, way to go samsung you are really killing apple sales and making them consider to lower their so called premium prices for "premium devices".*Last and not least, it's beautiful, it's well made (really strong) and can be a tablet i can use and take anywhere, this is the real portable tablet, anything else that is not 7 inches is simply clunky and old as a laptop.Why i did not buy a kindle Fire? well if you travel abroad the kindle fire will not work outside the US, search google for the troublesWhy did i not buy a nexus? because it did not have memory expansion, i have tons of tv shows and movies and music, i cannot live without my entertainment, i dont play many games so if you really are a gamer please get the nexus, but if you are a heavy music player or video loko then get this baby, it's a monster for the price.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this tablet 4 days ago and it's been good for the most part...well the main reason why i bought this tablet is because i like something small for facebook, E-mail and that kinds of thing, i didn't want to buy a laptop because i wanted something small and compact, but not as small as a phone, and it's perfect at that web browsing is actually really good on this device (if you have wi-fi)and i really appreaciate that. well i can tell you this i love android more than apple but not because i can't afford apple it's just because android gives you more freedom to do what you want with your device (even rooting which is actually legal). I've only had one problem with it it's the storage: if you are like me that i dind't buy this tablet as a gamer's tablet, but you know i enjoy some games sometimes, so on the second day i was really enjoying this tablet aand my friend showed me new need for speed most wanted game so i decided to download it (it was only 30mb) until i opened it and made me install 1.5gb of data for the game.the tablet is supposed to be 8gb but only has about 4.5gb of storage so i decided to buy a mini SD card for it 16gb was great for this (i recommend you buy a class 10 sd card), it turns out that you only have about 3gb for apps and you cannot install them in your SD card which is my BIGGEST PROBLEM, so after getting the need for speed gae i only have 1.8gb of internal storage left which sucks!!! what most people tell me is you should have bought nexus 7 16gb, but this one was 179.99, so i figured if it has a mini SD card slot, i can get how many ever apps i want, WRONGG! samsung should have been more clear on this on this description. thats my only and biggest problem and it is a deal breaker for me but oh well i guess i'll have to live with it!Pros-price-fast-lighweight and compact-mid to high end product-great web browsing (i recommend Chrome)Cons-Doesn't support apps on ext. SD card (deal breaker for some people)-4gb of internal storage out of the box (too much bloatware, crapware?)

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first foray into the world of tablets, so I don't really have anything to compare this to, but I'm having a lot of fun with this little tablet. I really, really wanted a tablet and the Galaxy's price was right. I think it's probably a good starter tablet. It took me a couple of weeks just to get used to using the touch screen because I've never had one before, and then about a month to work my way through all the apps that were already installed on it, to figure out what they did and which ones I wanted to keep using.I think of this as my Google Galaxy because I have easy access to my Gmail, Google docs, contacts, Google Play, Google books, Google music, Google everything, right on the home screen. And I like the little whistle it makes when I have new email.Oh, and I can't forget my Kindle app. If I want to spend an hour or more reading, I prefer my actual Kindle, but the Kindle app is great for a quick bit of reading here and there and it synchs with my Kindle so I can pick up where I left off on either device. Also, I've found that the Kindle app is the best choice for displaying PDFs (among the choices that came already installed). The Galaxy is the same size as my Kindle so it's easy to take along everywhere I go.At first, typing on the touch screen drove me crazy, but now I'm pretty good at it. However, I would never use it for a lot of typing, just short emails. (I'm typing this on my laptop, not the Galaxy.) I still have trouble with the tiny "x" on the browser when I want to close a screen. I have to try several times before I hit it just right, toggling back and forth between the screen I want to keep and the screen I want to close. Arrrrgh! But, nevertheless, I'm having a lot of fun with this little gadget and I'm glad I bought it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I am not the type to write reviews but this tablet has been such an positive experience for me I have to share my experience. First and foremost size was my primary driving factor. I didn't want the standard 10' tablet. I wanted something bigger than my droid cell phone that was easy to hold and easy the hand to type on the keyboard without having to strain or remove my hands from holding the tablet. This does that perfectly! It was easy to set up my gmail account and sync all other email accounts along with my calendar. The camera and video camera work great and deliver quality resolutions images and there is pre-install editing software for both photos and videos. The web browser took a bit of time to figure out how bookmarks are set up and managed but aside from that it works great. The speakers are way more than I expected out of a tablet. This is a dual core processor tablet which is reflected in how well it responds when navigating from app to app or within a specific application. I was able to use the tablet for extended periods of time with heavy camera and video usage without having the battery drain on me. I would say I had the tablet on all day while traveling in Manhattan and was constantly taking photos and video from early am till late pm and the battery still had life to it. Very impressive. Navigation is easy from app to app to settings with easy access touch screen options for viewing active/open apps or navigating to the task killer (nice feature) to quickly getting to settings. The wifi works great in detecting wifi networks. The Samsung comes with a feature to track your tablet should it get lost/stolen.Things that could be improved (but not deal breakers). In BRIGHT outdoor sun, viewing the screen image is difficult depending on the angle, even with the brightest screen setting set (which is easily accessed from screen). It would also have been nice to have a USB port to easily transfer photos/file/etc to and from a flash drive (although the existing power cable easily connects to a USB port on your computer to get around this).Side note: My first couple of days after setting up the wifi connection in my home, the internet connection would repeatedly drop for a few seconds and immediately reconnect. After a bit of online research I found out it was not the tablet but rather the channel my router was set to. This was easily resolved by installing a wifi analyzer app from Google Play, seeing what channels had less usage in my area and switching to one of those channels. My tablet has internet connection and has yet to drop the connection.I really am very impressed with this gadget/tablet and would recommend it to anyone.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I am SO glad I went with this instead of the Kindle or Nook! It is so much more versatile and user friendly! I have both Kindle and Nook apps on it and both work great! You cannot do that with either of the others....they are TOO PROPRIETARY! I also have both Amazon store and Google play and both download fast and are simple to use. I did not have to 'break' or whatever the term is, my new tablet just to get free apps from the most reputable sellers! I guess I don't understand why they are so stingy with their stuff. I think it is silly to be that proprietary! I am sure they could find a way to make even MORE money if they would just open up.Anyway, I recommend this tablet for people who simply want a great E Reader...that also CAN play games, search the internet, check email, and see in color. Its great!Thanks Samsung!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I was torn between the Galaxy Tab, Kindle Fire HD, and Nexus 7. I consider this the best purchase I've made in a while. Got it refurbed (in perfect condition) for 159 from Amazon; also saw it was $159 refurbed on Walmart, and saw it later at my local Costco for $189 new with a few accessories. There were things I liked about all the tablets; what it came down to for me was that the Galaxy Tab has cameras on front and back, expandable SD storage, unlocked Jellybean, and the refurbed deal. I had actually decided on the Nexus 7 over the Kindle Fire HD when I walked in to my local Best Buy and picked this tablet up. I found its form factor to be excellent and the tablet was responsive. I hadn't heard much about it previously but it came into the mix and in the end won out.Overall: 5/5 - It's thin, light, easy to hold in one hand, it's weaknesses are less weak than others, and it's just an all-around solid tablet.Battery - 4/5 - Has lasted at least 5-6 hours on every charge so far, if not longer.Display - 3.5/5 - This is probably its biggest weakness. It's more than adequate, but it won't amaze you. Both the Nexus and Fire HD have it beat here. It won't blow you away but it does what it needs to.Processor/RAM/Speed - 4/5 - Doesn't have the greatest specs, but it runs smooth on Jellybean. All apps I have tried work fine, rarely if ever a force close.Speakers - 4.5/5 - I wasn't expecting much out of the speakers, but was pleasantly surprised. They get plenty loud without sound tinny. Not much bass, but they're great!Accessories - I do wish it had the normal USB chargers as I already have a million for my phone, but the battery lasts long enough it's not a worry. I recommend the TechArmor screen protectors, around $8 and easy to put on. Got a case but it's not here yet. I haven't got an SD card yet. I don't plan on taking a whole bunch of pictures or anything.Included Apps - The peel smart remote is cool! It's better than my cable remote for sure. Takes about 30 seconds to set up. The included Samsung App store is worthless, just stick to Google Play.Great tablet! Buy it, no regrets!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my Girlfriend for her birthday and she says its the best gift EVER! We went on vacation and she brought it and it has a prety loud speaker. I used it and its just like using my phone so its pretty easy. The only problem with it is that I didnt get one for Myself.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this product because I had an inferior tablet, which I was not able to get the same results as I expected. My friend has the Samsung Galaxy Tablet and when I saw what she was able to do with it, I was sold, and purchased the same product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought it after the ipad mini came out. I had an ipad2 but found it too awkward, bulky and heavy. I don't like the idea of having to pay for the good ipad aps. In that regard Samsung and android have better choice, in my opinion.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm a free thinker and anything that is not named after a fruit I feel fine giving it my endorsement. Behold the humble Galaxy Tab!It's called GALAXY, not I-(insert any noun beginning with P here), not Black(fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary). It's called a freaking GALAXY!!!!Pros1) Android, Open Source, Freedom.2) Fits PERFECTLY in one hand.3) FULL ASCII screenlock password (numbers, letters, symbols)4) Full encryption for the entire device (configurable).5) The GPS works indoors (kinda spooky though, The NSA would have no trouble finding me).6) Came with a 32 GB Card (The &#34;I&#34; crowd usually goes silent at this point).7) Came with a neat Poetic Leather case that is as tough as an old chainsmoking grandmother.Cons1) The video playback, while barely noticible, is not as good as the I-Pad (crap I used a bad word). I'm willing to overlook this minor flaw becasue it's so small it really isn't even worth mentioning.So, if you have the ability to think for yourself, buy this tablet and you will be most pleased.!! :)

tablet_galaxy_tab|I was recently gifted this tablet as a replacement for another tablet my cat felt the need to destroy. Initial impression was good - Nothing was broken or missing, no dead pixels, no screen flickering or nonexistent battery life.Having tinkered with it for the past two days, I can say with absolute certainty that, short of it bursting into flames, I love this thing.The screen is adequate - Not the best, but not even approaching bad. The tablet feels very solid, like a piece of equipment rather than a toy. Touchscreen is responsive, smooth, and hasn't lagged at all. 'Tis a fingerprint magnet, but that ought to be obvious.The cameras are nothing to get excited about, but are neat to have. The speakers are probably one of my favorite parts of this tablet - While they aren't front-facing, neither are they on the back of the thing - They're located on the bottom edge, and louder than I expected.Wifi is functional, with range on par with that of my phone (Samsung Infuse). Bluetooth works fine, with no complaints.Battery life is pretty decent, and it charges quickly. The Micro SD slot works fine, and the cover fits perfectly. Haven't used the IR, so I can't comment on that.Overall, I love this thing. While it certainly isn't the most powerful or shiny tablet out there, it is far, far more than enough for $199. My single complaint - and not about the tablet itself - is the charging cord. I don't mind it being Samsung's proprietary cable, but the thing is friggin' short. I can work around it, but it's still mildly annoying.Will update this review if anything changes.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Overview:I am very happy with the Tab and use it daily for many things. The highest praise I can give is that my wife is jealous of it. But you have to go into it with reasonable expectations - if you compare it to an iPad you are likely to be disappointed. I had no previous experience with an iPad, other than testing it an an Apple store, or any smartphone, so the capabilities were a revelation to me. I chose it primarily because of the price and size - the iPad seemed too big and heavy for use as a book and magazine reader, and I did not want a phone with a monthly payment. The Tab is comfortable to use standing on the Metro, on airplanes or lying down on the couch. Others have complained that it is laggy, but I don't find this a big problem. Like others I have found that it can be difficult to press the right button, especially in apps where the buttons are closely spaced, but somehow over time this has ceased to be an issue for me. Typing with two thumbs is easy and responsive, especially in portrait mode. Caveat: the market for small tablets is changing rapidly, with Google's Nexus, new flavors of Kindle Fire, and a rumored mini-iPad in the offing, so the competitiveness of this device is up in the air - it will have to evolve to stay viable.Specifics:1. Reading books: I chose this over the Kindle Fire and BN Nook because I did not want to be tied to one vendor and wanted a more open Android experience. I do not regret this. I also considered some e-ink readers, but have not found any problems with eyestrain reading the LCD screen and can read in sunlight to a degree if I crank up the brightness.2. Reading magazines and pdfs: I chose the Tab over an e-ink reader in part because I wanted to read media other than books. This works well despite the small screen size. While not optimal for 8.5x11 or A4 size pages, expanding 2-fold by tapping or pinch-and-zoom is available in most magazine and pdf apps and is good enough. I mainly use Zinio for magazines and repli-go pdf reader for pdfs, which in addition make it easy to jump around in long documents.3. Camera: Specs are not impressive, but I have found it quite useful for close-up photos like portrait shots. The convenience of having it on a device I often carry with me anyway and direct upload to Dropbox or Picasa make it preferable to a stand-alone camera.4. Web browsing and email: A great convenience to have on-the-go or when you want to look up something in a book. For serious usage, I still prefer my laptop.5. Calendar: Sync with my Google calendar is very handy. Again, for serious usage, a laptop is better.6. Storage: I don't store movies or much music so even the 8 GB on board (4.59 GB usable) is adequate, but I bought a 32 GB micro SD card for extra space (and a bargain at $20 plus shipping). Most apps can't use it, so it is not a complete solution, but it is a convenient place to stash photos and documents that are not tied to a dedicated app.7. Battery life: As advertised if you limit Wi-fi use, Bluetooth, and GPS to when you need them. It also helps to keep the screen brightness down as this is the main power hog.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this tablet with second thoughts thinking I didn't "need" a tablet, as my smart phone and laptop are excellent. After much pondering, I purchased it. I absolutely love it! The browser is much faster than I expected and the visual quality of the pics and videos are much better than I expected. This device is axiomatic for most people probably, with not much use for the user manual. I looked at the manual after I had used it all day and already had it set up like I wanted it with apps, icons on the screens, etc. The battery life is better than I expected. I often checked the battery level after watching a Netflix movie and found only about 10-12% drain on the battery level.I would recommend getting a stand and a nice case for it. The stand so you are less likely to drop it and the case so if you do drop it, it hopefully will protect it. It is very easy to slip out of your hands, so be careful. I'm still looking for a rubberized perimeter protector for it and haven't located on yet. Buy a micro SD card too for extra space. I bought a 16 GB to go with mine.I have noticed that I use my laptop less now, so that will extend the life of my laptop hopefully. Facebook, e-mail, weather, and reading news is a very nice experience on this device. I got the 7 inch one instead the 10 inch. I held the 10 inch and it just seemed too big to be convenient. I have no regrets with the 7 inch. It is large enough for ease of use, but not too big for a bulky experience. I hope this is helpful.

tablet_galaxy_tab|First of all, I have to really wonder about the many reviewers who bought this device, then returned, and gave it bad reviews because it doesn't save apps to the SD card. Since about 1 in every 5 of the 274 reviews (and counting) clearly complain that it doesn't save apps to the SD card - do you people who still continue to buy it, return, and complain because of that NOT bother to READ any of the reviews first before buying it???Anyway, I've had this device for over 6 weeks now, and it does everything I wanted in a tablet - and within the max price I was willing to pay. I previously bought a $150 tab and ended up returning it because it was under powered (IMO, you really need dual core CPU to properly run ICS 4), and my research indicated that the really cheap devices couldn't even play netflix movies properly.I added a few 'accessories' that further enhanced the quality and usage- a Poetic case for ~$18 that fits like a glove and is very functional (multiple viewing angles for movies, enhanced grip and no fingerprints, good protection)- a good screen protector (originally designed for the 1st samsung galaxy tab 7) that gives a smoother feel when swiping on the screen- turned on the "hotspot" feature on my android phone (extra monthly fee from verizon), so now I have 4G with this tablet anywhere there is 4G service...sweeeeeet!Pros:- netflix runs great on it- good ebook reading experience- screen quality is very good for doing the above- camera - only because it's better than not having one at all (it's not great, but not as bad as some have written).- 7" rules for portability and comfortable reading. It's kind of funny watching folks trying to comfortably hold up their clunky (compared to 7") ipads for reading during the daily commute.- internet surfing is excellent, either with home wifi or connected to my 4G phone via hotspot.Cons:- Peel remote app doesn't work at all with my Sony 40" tv. I sent a support request to the company, a couple of times, and received no response.- guess what? YOU CAN'T SAVE APPS TO THE SD CARD FOLKS!!Since neither of the above Cons impact what I need a tablet for (still have plenty of internal memory to install more apps, if I need to), I gave it 5 stars, for overall quality and functionality.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I really have to hand it to Samsung when it comes to their 7 inch Galaxy Tab 2. I've been waiting for an inexpensive 7 inch tablet to come out and this one really hits the mark for me. It has the features that I need and does without the features that I don't care about to give me a fantastic piece of awesome for only $250. You get the full tablet experience minus some arguably, unnecessary extras. For instance, HDMI out is not supported and there's no flash. Other than that, this is like a Kindle Fire with two decent, basic cameras, a fully functional Android 4.0 ICS build, and the 7 inch frame that my thumbs and back pocket love. On top of that it sports the best battery life of any 7 inch tablet available, and that's what really sells it. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great 7 inch tablet and doesn't care to spend over $300. Thanks Samsung! I'll be looking forward to investing in the 7 inch Galaxy Tab 3 when it arrives on the scene.P.S. If you're a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 owner and are having battery life issues you can take some steps to make it better. The first thing I would recommend is controlling your display brightness. That's the biggest culprit. Another recommendation would be to learn how to root your device, load Clockwordmod Recovery, and load a custom rom. Cyanogenmod 9 is out for this tab and it really makes it a pleasure to work with. I don't really care for Touchwiz anyway.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I had been wanting a tablet for a while, but I couldn't justify paying $500+ for something I didn't absolutely need. I had considered other, less expensive options, but not been happy enough to actually purchase anything. The Barnes & Noble Nook Color was an option, but I would have wanted to root it, and I didn't want the hassle. I wanted to use my tablet, not work on it. The Kindle Fire is nice, but it has limited storage (which isn't expandable) and doesn't have access to the Google Play store.Then Samsung finally got my business. A 7" tablet with a good processor, expandable memory, and decent battery life, all for the great list price of $250.The screen on this isn't the highest resolution, but it is clear and represents color well. I am not crazy about the auto-brightness control; it seems a little too bright in dark light and too dim in bright light. But lock the screen brightness to 50% and I rarely have to touch it. Plus, you can set up a screen widget to change the brightness if needed.The body of the tablet is nice to hold, not too slick, but no rubbery feeling. The heft makes it feel solid, but it is not too heavy to hold for long periods of time.The battery life seems to be doing well for what I need. The only caveat is that, as with all wireless devices, the wifi will drain the battery faster when it is searching for but not connected to a network. Not a big deal if you are at home and connected, but you may want to turn the wifi off if you are taking a trip.And the OS is Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich or ICS) straight out of the box. There is no need to root this device to improve the software; its already as good as you can get (at least for now).Is this going to match the experience of an iPad? No. It isn't really meant to either, since the screen is only 7". But it isn't locked into the iOS/iTunes ecosystem either, like an iPad. This also isn't as expensive as an iPad.If you don't plan to take the tablet away from wifi, don't need expandable storage, and are happy living in the Amazon ecosystem, the Kindle Fire is a good choice and a little less expensive. If you are willing to spend $500+, there are tablets that can do more, run faster, or have more features. However, if you want a tablet that can hold your music or movies while you travel, want the full Android ICS experience, and aren't made of money, this table it for you!To sum it up, this tablet is the best value of quality, features, and value currently on the market. I fully recommend this tablet.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I already own the Ipad 1 and I share that with my kids. Due to the 16 gig limit and my kids needing to stuff it with apps I wanted to get something to call my own. Truly I didn't want to spend a lot of money since I already have an Ipad and I wanted something with significant memory so that I wouldn't have the same maxed out storage issues I have with my Ipad. So I decided to purchase the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and for the most part it meets my needs. It runs smoothly and the additional storage option (32 gig mini SD) is welcomed. I don't miss not having the App Store because The Android Market has many of the same apps as well as more than enough apps to keep me happy.My only issue is that I wanted to play movies from my digital download library so I could watch a movie when I wasn't in a WIFI hotspot. Although the specs say that this thing plays most codecs I found that to be untrue. After attempting to load 15 or so movies I literally got only one to play. To me this is very disappointing and frustrating. It also takes a long time for movies to download onto the device unlike iTunes. I hope this is a temporary glitch but it's enough for me to take one star away from the device's score.Other great features are the cameras. Although they aren't up to actual dedicated camera standards they are more than adequate for a small tablet. I don't plan to use them that often since I own cameras. Being able to view websites with Flash is also nice. The size of the tablet is perfect for on the go as well. I don't find that the 10" Ipad is that cumbersome but this 7" tablet just makes it that much easier to take with you. The screen size and quality is nice.In my humble opinion this device is well worth the money. It really meets most of my needs. Now if you want the fastest device with all of the premium specs you will be disappointed. This is as good as it gets at this price point for now. I am happy with my purchase so far!PS. If anyone has any information on how to make my digital downloads play on this device please share. Thanks.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Original review:For this review I thought I would provide some details about this tablet from a comparison point of view to the Asus Transformer Tf101. I won't focus on the obvious hardware differences (screen size, port differences, etc.) But instead will talk about some of the lesser known differences.Pros-mini app bar - this is a nice feature (but also a source of annoyance) and can provide quick popup access to some features (calendar, alarms, email (not gmail), calculator, music player, task manager, world clock). Asus provides nothing like this.-a dedicated screen capture button on the Galaxy while Asus requires holding the Recent Apps Key.-the Galaxy keyboard is way better than the Asus provided keyboard. It uses a much smaller percentage of space but yet is still easy to use. I am used to using Thumbs Keyboard app on the Asus and even that app occupies more screen space than the Samsung keyboard.-Samsung provides a better application list UI than Asus does. With Asus you can just view the apps and jump to the store. With Samsung you can also customize the order, hide apps and create folders of apps on your home screens.-Samsung doesn't require an insane amount of power to charge the unit. My Motorola droid USB charge adapter (which I have several for use with ipods ) is powerful enough to charge this. Asus on the other hand requires an insane amount of power.Cons-mini apps bar reduces visibility to notification icons when in portrait orientation. I can only see the battery, wifi, time, and weatherbug temp. No ability to see email notifications. When held in landscape, the other notifications become visible. It is odd because there is still about 3/4" of space between the mini app ^ and the last icon.-mini app bar is not able to be disabled. This means if you value the notification area more than what this feature provides or get annoyed by hitting it instead of the spacebar there is no ability to shut it off.-Asus provides the ability to disconnect wifi when screen is off setting to help preserve battery life although no similar offering exists with Samsung-Asus provides the ability to disable the screen capture feature-Asus provides several custom Widgets while the Samsung does seem to have anything special.General notes I am disappointed that when adding a memory card it does not allow it be used like on a phone where you can install apps on it to recover some internal memory. This seems to be a flaw with Android's ICS OS and is not specific to this device, as the same is true for my Asus. I just didn't buy a memory card for my Asus since it has 32gb. I am not certain if I would have got this had I known about this before. In any event I suspect that I'll be able to manage as I can have the camera use the sdcard and I can also store music on it. And these should be the main consumers of space.The home screens have grid dimensions of 6 cells wide by 5 high. On Asus it is 8 wide by 7 high (this makes sense given the resolution difference)So far I have run into one app that I wanted on this that play store said isn't supported (peapod) but I was able to transfer it to this from my Asus and install it, and it seems to work just fine. I like knowing that this is an option that I can try if more apps have a similar issue.Now if I can only find a better way to prevent purchasing content through one click through the Amazon Appstore I might be inclined to get this for the kids. The price point and features are certainly where I wanted it to be and I am happy with this purchase. My only wish was that it had a 1280x800 resolution but it seems less of an issue now that I have it.UPDATE 12/2012 - Comparison to Google Nexus 7So my kids wanted a tablet and they ended selecting the Google Nexus 7 (16gb) instead of this one (and at the time it was purchased the same price. Now you get a 32gb Nexus for the same price). Now that I have been able to use both I have a few comparisons to point out about the Nexus to this tablet.The main issues I see with this device compared to the Nexus is the 8gb of built in memory. Although true Galaxy allows a memory card for music/photos/movies and the Nexus doesn't, my wife often complains that she runs out of room for apps. There are a few apps that are quite large that just limit what she can put on this. The kids have 8gb of space still available so I don't foresee them complaining of space issues anytime soon.Another issue I see in day to day use of the Samsung is with the size of the back, home, app manager on-screen buttons. They seem to be a bit too close to each other and also seen to be harder to reach if a case is installed (they both have the same brand/style case) . The design change that was done for the Nexus OS which puts the buttons in the middle with more space between them actually works very good for this size tablet. I first didn't like the Nexus change but now I find that it was a good change.As for speed comparisons I do feel that the Nexus is faster than the Samsung. The Nexus is significantly smoother than the Samsung. Its even smoother than my Asus. As for network speeds, the devices are the same. I saw 19k kbps/3.8k kbps on both units. This is slower than my Asus which received 22k kbps/3.8k kbps.The screen resolution is the same on the Nexus as the Asus so it also looks better than the Samsung does.The only point which I feel the Samsung exceeds the Nexus in is the fact the Samsung has 2 cameras while the Nexus doesn't. This means that the Samsung can take quick pictures of things for easier reference later, while the Nexus can't.So if the kids need a quick copy of a document they must scan it and save on the device instead of just taking a quick photo. The scans are obviously better quality but less convenient.The other advantage the Samsung has is due to the fact that it is an older OS so it still supports flash content, while the Nexus doesn't. I'm certainly disappointed in Google's change in direction on this as it means like Amazon video reviews are not viewable on the Nexus.So in the end now that we have all 3 of these devices, I must say that I prefer the Nexus over the Samsung (and I think my wife wishes she had it instead).

tablet_galaxy_tab|So far, this tablet, an early entry for Samsung in relatively discounted tablets, has more or less met my expectations and I really like it (if Amazon would allow half star ratings I would have done 4.5).One thing new buyers should be aware of is that as the operating system version, Ice Cream Sandwich, is still fairly new in deployment, there are still some shortcomings albeit on the whole minor. The only prominent shortcoming I've seen so far, and it's significant but short-term, is that nearly all of the applications are not yet capable of taking advantage of the external SD card, and the very popular apps that allow one to move data and applications to an external SD card don't seem, from my experience, to function yet with this new version of the OS or at least on this hardware implementation. It's clear this will change in fairly rapid order, but given it's only a 4 GB internal card it's quite easy to fill up the storage on your first day if you are a content-heavy person (I was loading the hundreds of songs I would typically put on, not realizing it wasn't going to the external card at first, even though one of the "move 2 SD" apps said the app in question had its data on the external card).But the performance is great on this device, and I've already loaded dozens of apps and am able to run everything quite smoothly.The only other notable disappointment is Samsung does a poor job of giving a user a good start on the device, at least in my opinion. Instructions on how to start using it are quire spare. If I were not an experienced Android user I think I'd be at least somewhat upset; even as an experienced Android user I experienced a few frustrating moments but nothing insurmountable or lengthy. Some of this isn't Samsung's fault (though they really could have provided a far better guide), rather there's also the issue of the ongoing changes in Android's environment. For example, when I went to use the Android App Market, I suddenly got the Google Play app asking for permission, and I had somehow totally missed the news about Play replacing the Android App Market. This led to some issues as I tried to stop this "strange app" which was appearing with no explanation whatsoever.For my uses, this is really an excellent product (or at least it will excel as soon as more data and apps work on the external SD, which clearly will happen), and I'm glad it came out so I didn't have to spend more on the prior "Plus" 7" tablet. I think the design tradeoffs (the lesser camera, and some other things I read about that I don't recall) are quite fine and I look forward to using this device for some time to come.Oh, one other frustration I should mention, the plastic door/gate/whatever it is that is supposed to hold the external SD card in is really wonky and at least feels like it's going to break off with any real use. Just trying to open it I felt like I was breaking part of it, but I think that's because it hangs by a plastic thread, so to speak. Not sure. But I want to note that once I seated it back properly it has fit fine and so I cannot tell if my concern is mere perception or if over time, especially if the card is taken in and out on occasion (though not sure that will happen), it will detach.Otherwise the hardware is really quite nice.

tablet_galaxy_tab|So this is not my first Android or Samsung device but I have to say for under $250 it sure is a fun toy! I had a Kindle Fire and have switch. Why? Becuase they are both 7 inches but the Galaxy has way more feature and full Android Play store. No need to go there for this review.Here's my observation and experience so far using it for a few days.Display -Obviously, AMOLED kicks rear as typical with all Samsung devices.Screen -Layout is a little lacking in terms of height/width adjustments. I do not like the extra spacing between the clock and the weather, should've made it a little tigher together. I felt the open spaces between widgets and icons just was useless and a waste of screen real estate..Sound -Much much louder than a Kindle for sure. This is awesome on flights where you sit near the engine.Battery -So far so good, I left it on with my WIFI on all day and came back after 9 hours of work to find it at 97%. Not bad at all. Have yet to play 2-3 movies to see if it'll hold up against what the Kindle can do on a 5hr flight. TBDWIFI -does not see ad-hoc wifi (wifi tethering on phones), but nothing Foxfi BT or Rooting won't solve. Not a killer deal but sucks compared to Kindle.Signal strength is fine for work or office and locks on quick.GPS -Not not yet used, don't care to use it since I have a Galaxy 2 phone.Form factor -Love it, great size, good feel to it, light enough to not feel fatigue when holding. Though I have ordered a case and screen protector (which I always do).Memory size -Yes like everyone says, around 3.5GB left on internal memory. Nothing Rooting won't solve with APP to SD. :) Love the External SD option.Charging cable , interface -This is where I hate. Come'on Samsung don't you ever learn? Galaxy 10 and now this? Who puts in a proprietary plug (I won't name Apple... Opps I did). Also the cable is not long enough! Even the Kindle and Iconia had micro USB and both I've owned in the past.BLOAT WARE / Software?My other grip is no SWYPE! After using it on my G2 phone I need it, Samsung phone is Samsung, is Samsung Tablet not made by Samsung? Does the company not talk to each other and have some kind of standard on what comes with a Samsung Android device? WTFail. No Swype is sad, get up to speed and get your act together.That's all for now. So I guess you can't have it all so I took 1 star off due to the charging cable/proprietary plug and lacking Swype.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this primarily so that I could use it for ebooks in both the Kindle and EPUB formats. It has surpassed my expectations for this. An added bonus which I did not realize I would get is that it also runs the Overdrive application so that I can access library books directly from the device and not have to download and transfer them as I did with my Nook. I run all three of the major reading apps (Kindle, Nook and Overdrive) and all work well.I also use this as a web browser when I travel. It is far better than carrying a laptop, and much more readable than my smartphone for internet use. Sites seem to load well, and once you learn to not hold the device at the lower left hand corner the wireless connects easily and quickly, and is pretty stable once connected.Is it a heavy duty laptop replacement? No, but it does work well for browsing the internet, email (both yahoo and gmail), and it is a GREAT e-reader. It is far superior to my nook tablet.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have the New iPad (aka the iPad 3) and my mom has the Kindle Fire so I have used that as well. I would have to say that overall the Galaxy Tab 2 has worked great. I received it about three days ago and I really like it. I like my iPad but I always thought it was a little too big. I liked the size of the Fire but I felt that the operating system on it was too limited. I decided the Galaxy Tab 2 7" looked right for the price. It's $50 more expensive than the Fire and $450 cheaper than my 64GB iPad 3. The screen is not as clear or bright as the iPad 3 and the video quality isn't as good as the Kindle Fire but I would say that it is not too bad. Don't expect excellent video quality because it's not but you can't expect all the bells and whistles of a high end tablet for only $250. I like the android ice cream sandwich OS. It looks nice on this device and it's a lot different than Amazon's version of android OS on the Kindle Fire. The interface is fairly smooth and intuitive. I haven't really had much delay when tapping on icons or sliding the screen. It's not quite as smooth and sensitive as the iPad but let's face it, if you are interested in buying the Galaxy Tab 2 7" it is probably for the price and you have ruled out the iPad for that reason or because maybe you have one already. I think the camera isn't too bad considering the Kindle Fire doesn't even have one. It is front and back. There is 8GB of internal memory with an expandable slot for up to 32GB micro SD card. That is a plus over the Fire. I find it easy to put music and movies onto the micro SD card, then put the card in the Galaxy Tab and it very quickly loads all of it onto the device to play. Easier than using the iTunes software if you ask me. The speakers on the Galaxy Tab are not as clear and crisp or even as loud as the iPad 3 but it gets loud enough for my taste. The sound is better and louder with headphones. With headphones it sounds pretty good. The Galaxy Tab 2 is more portable than the iPad because if you don't carry a bag of some sort to put it in you can still fit it in your front pocket. You wont be able to put much else in that pocket and it sticks out but you certainly can't do that with the iPad. As far as android play store, I am new to it. I'm used to iTunes but there are many of the same apps available on the play store. There is a Kindle app so you can still read your ebooks. As far as I can tell there is no way to play Amazon VOD for Prime members or otherwise. You also can't really sync your iTunes purchases to the Galaxy Tab 2 either. There are work arounds that allow you to put iTunes movies and music on the Tab but if that is something that interests you, you can always look that up. Surfing the web is easy and you can use firefox or opera if you want. I have read some reviews that say surfing the web on this tablet is slow but I have no found that to be the case. Web pages don't load quite as fast as the iPad but they load pretty quickly. I also read reviews about how the wifi connection isn't as strong on this device as it is on other tablets. That appears to be the case but it really hasn't resulted in slow internet speeds for me; and my internet provider doesn't provide me with very good upload and download speeds. Overall for the price I would say this is a good tablet. You can get a few cellphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note or the upcoming SIII for $200-$250 that are like this tablet but with better specs. However, that is the price you pay if you have an upgrade available otherwise without an upgrade you will pay retail of $500-$550. I think that even the Galaxy Note's 5.3" screen is a bit too small for a tablet though. The 7" screen is just right for an extra-portable tablet. I would recommend the Galaxy Tab 2 7". You can wait until July when supposedly a 7" Google Asus tablet will be released for $200. It is supposed to have better specs. Just FYI.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This Tab surprised me somewhat with is overall performance. Knowing its the baby in the new tab range I expected a fairly bland device. I have an Ipad2 and use that as my yardstick to measureImpressed me was:1. Peel universal remote control, operates all my LG devices as well as Allshare*2. Full GPS3. Really responsive, runs applications well and multi-tasks well.4. ICS is nice, but I also like Gingerbread.5. Streams music and video as though it was born to do so.6. The upgrade to 40 gigs cost only $22 for a decent SD card7. Is a nice size to carry around, is light too - functionally mobileNot so cool:1. Now and then a Lag while scrolling2. Sometimes wish I had the 10.1 inch, but is not annoying to read magazines and KindleIf it was about a 8 and a half inch, I reckon it would have got 5 starsThe apps, while making this tablet complete, I miss one or 2 that apple has, but then again, I would say the same for the apple.

tablet_galaxy_tab|It's a good tablet for a price. Well built, nice minimalistic package.Samsung support could not confirm Gorilla Glass screen on this product, so i wish a screen protector being there, but...Unfortunately, the WiFi only (P3113) versions comes first, and still no 3G versions (P3100).Cons:1. Lack of internal memory (just 4,5Gb free of 8Gb), and no option to install apps to external card. That is a Samsungs feature - sdcard is a internal card, so you can move apps just there, but no extsdcard.2. Touchwiz (samsung launcher) is laggy3. Cameras, not good quality, both of them4. I wish battery lasts at least a hour more (it says 7hrs but in fact is 6hrs)5. No NTFS support right of the box (NTFS Mounter app helps)Pros:1. Well built product, good materials and construction2. Good WiFi quality (it finds networks that no other devices finds)3. 48Gb of free Dropbox space (for 12 month)4. microSD storage (bye-bye Kindle Fire!)5. IR booster, but lack of apps using it. Also its in american (P3113) versions only6. It's slim an pretty fits on my jacket pockets. Size like a Kindle Keyboard 3g, and cheap cover from K3 fits too!!!7. Customizable by custom firmwares (from XDA, etc.), getting root is vital for me, so it can be done easylyThe USB OTG feature is working well with adaptors, i've tested some of USD Flash and 2,5 HDD with external power.I hope it supports some USB 3g modem, bu it has not confirmed yet.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this for my wife 2 weeks ago. She decided she wanted a tab after playing with a friends kindle fire. She was a little annoyed that I spent more money on a tab she didn't want, but after 1 day with this she is so glad she has it instead of the fire. In our opinion the fifty dollars is well worth it. This thing is very fast I was surprised, it is very responsive in every way. It has bogged down once but that was on the first day after setting all up and downloading all her programs for the play store. I rebooted after that and since then it hasn't skipped a beat.Pros:Battery life- My wife gets 3 to 5 days on a charge using it 2 to 4 hours a day mainly for reading, light web browsing, and email.IR blaster- the included remote software is pretty cool (it has a built in TV guide on the T.S.)Screen- very bright, bright enough for outside viewing and also still looks very good when turned all the way down for viewing in a dark room.video- plays video buttery smoothSound- Nice and loud from the on-board speakersmemory- expandable memory is always a good thingspeed and smoothness of the UIOS- ICS is a great OS it took a little bit of getting used to coming from gingerbread but I like it a lot.Cons:Cameras- The cameras are both a little low res. On the front it's not a big deal it still looks good over Skype. The back camera however seems a little soft even in bright light, and of coarse there is no flash. For us this is non issue we don't use a tablet to take picturesScreen- it is a bit reflective this would be a bigger problem if the screen wasn't so bright. I would say this will probably benefit from a slightly matted screen protector (this is just a hunched we haven't tried one yet)speaker placement- both of the speakers are on the bottom when you hold it in portrait mode this gives you good stereo sound, unfortunately when you hold it in landscape (the way most people will watch videos on it) this puts both the speakers on right side of the screen so not only do you get sound in only one ear you often also end up covering one of the speakers while your holding it.For what you get over the kindle I would have expected it to cost $100 more than the Fire.In the current market I consider this to be a bargain $249 buys one heck of a tablet!!!I hope this helps

tablet_galaxy_tab|So I've been looking for a tablet for a few months and I hadn't really seen anything that looked very spectacular. Either the tablets are priced at the cost of a mid-line notebook, or they don't provide near enough functionality/power for what I want. My primary needs for a tablet is to be able to read books, watch movies, and occasionally browse the internet and check email.To that end, this little tablet is great! I've tried bigger and more expensive tablets before, including the galaxy 10.1", but they always just seemed too big and clunky, and not very comfortable to hold. Plus their size made them a little less portable to carry around. This tablet on the other hand is comfortable to hold in both portrait and landscape mode, and is powerful enough to do anything I need it to. The fact that it was the same dual processor and nearly the same specs as the Galaxy 10.1" is pretty awesome!The only complaint that I have, is that although the screen is capacitative, and the device itself is highly responsive, the touch sensitivity seems a bit on the lower end. It's hardly noticeable the majority of the time, but when you're doing something touch intensive, you can tell.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Just bought in from costco. Love it. Advantage buying from Costco is 90 days return policy with no question asked.If you want to get top of the line tablet, then get Samsung 7.7 from verizon or wait for Toshiba Excite 7.7. Both will cost you $549-$599.This one is very good and not only it cost $250, but it does everything you would really need from 7 inch tablet. watching movies and reading books are great. On 7 inch you do not really need more pixel count screen. BTW, it is important to get right application from Android market. Get MX video and Cool Reader. you wont complain. Skype works perfect. Camera? Do you really hope to get good quality pictures from ANY of tablets or even iphone? I have DSLR for that.Performance of this tablet is really good. No problem with wifi connection. It in fact much faster then HP touchpad i have (POS BTW). Battery life is really good.I'm perfectly happy with this tablet. you can always wait for something better and cheaper at the same time, but then you are one of those people who always complain and NEVER buy anything. There will always something new with better specs, so you will wait forever.This tablet will probably satisfy needs for 90% of consumers who are looking for 7 inch tablets.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Had the Fire for a day. Glad I returned it as the Galaxy Tab 2 is truly a much better experience. At start up it upload all my Apps from my Thunderbolt and they work! (except a couple which were phone specific). Took a while to load my ITunes, but using DoubleTwist Air Sync everything worked great. Watched Iron Man 2 on Netflix - such fun. It even shows my iGoogle Home page, not some mobile phone simplify version. If you want a fun tab experience, this is a great choice.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Ok, the title of my review might be a little extreme but I stick by it. Anyone considering a Nook or Kindle should give this tablet a long, hard look. For an entry level, low cost tablet it has a lot of features the purpose built readers leave out. Not the least of which is this tablet is not tied to Barnes & Noble or Amazon. With this tablet you can get content from anywhere you want. Also, the Samsung has a GPS, front and rear cameras and a memory card slot. I believe the Nook has a memory slot too but the Kindle does not. The Samsung also has an IR blaster for controlling your home theater.My only other Android device is my nearly 2 year old Motorola Droid X phone and this tablet makes my phone feel very inadequate in almost every way. The tablets screen is bright, crisp and clear and it is very responsive with little to no lag. I believe that this screen has a higher pixel density than many of the 10" tablets as it is nearly the same resolution as the larger tablets in a smaller screen. I was holding out for a high res 10" tablet but decided to jump on this one because I was tired of waiting. I am not disappointed. It will be interesting to see if I end up preferring the 7" tablet after I use it a while. It is very light, small and portable and the screen real estate is really quite usable.Universal Remote:I just got my tablet last night and setup my home theater easily. I am disappointed with the interface of the supplied remote app though and will look around for a better version. But at least the tablet provides the ability to do it. To be fair though, I did not spend a lot of time with it so it may be better than I think.Kindle Reader:The Kindle reader app is very nice as the text is sharp and it turns pages very quickly. I think anyone coming from an e-ink based reader will enjoy using this tablet as a reader as well. My wife has the e-ink Kindle and has often wanted a back lit reader instead of using a book light. This screen will not be as readable outdoors though but I think most of my and my wife's reading is indoors so there is always a trade off.Streaming Music:I have not tried other media yet other than Pandora radio. You do get a little hiccup in the audio if you are surfing data intensive apps like Google Maps while you are streaming music. This may be the result of my pitiful DSL connection at home though. Will have to try it on a faster broadband connection sometime to see.Maps:Google Maps looks great on this device. Fortunately this tablet has a GPS chip so location based services/mapping are possible. It is a great size for mapping and once I get a 4G phone with WiFi ability, I will try it out as a navigation device. Hopefully Samsung will come out with a car dock for this tablet. Google Streetview is very nice on this tablet as well.Gmail:The Gmail app is extremely nice on this tablet. Even in portrait mode you get the folder list down the left side and your email in the currently selected folder displayed on the right. On my phone, you only get one folder at a time.Google Reader:I use Google Reader as my RSS app and it is very fast on the tablet compared to my phone. I go cross-eyed staring at my phone for very long but I can tell from my limited use of the reader on the tablet that the tablet will be great. The reader is really one of my most used apps and a big reason I wanted a tablet.Facebook:What can I say, Facebook is much nicer on a tablet than on the phone.Real Estate Apps:I am currently in the market to buy a house so I have the Realtor.com and Zillow apps. Both are much nicer on the tablet than on the phone. The photos on the Realtor app are much larger than what Zillow provides though which is odd. Photos on the phone are ok, but are hard to tell much about. With the tablet, the photos are much more usable.I may come back and add more to this review as I use the tablet more but in my 1 evening with it so far I can tell that I am going to love this tablet.**Update 5/9/2012**I got a chance to play with the tablet some more and have a few more observations to add.YouTube:YouTube looks great on this tablet. It will seamlessly flip from portrait to landscape without stopping the video. I personally think the YouTube app has a much better UI than the internet webpage.Speakers:The speakers are on the bottom of the tablet when the tablet is in portrait position. You have to watch that you don't rest it on your lap when listening to something using the speakers. If you turn it to landscape position, you have to watch that you don't cover the lower speaker with your hand. I found that if you hold the tablet with your fingers and cup the corner with the speaker it actually helps project the sound to you. I don't know where else they could put speakers as almost anywhere they are you will have to watch you don't cover them when you hold them so I won't complain about it.Games:What can I say, Angry Birds is awesome on a tablet. Words With Friends is nice as well. I haven't tried other games yet but expect them to look much better than they do on a phone.7" vs. 10" tablet:I don't know what to think about the size yet. I was trying to hold out for a high res 10" tablet that Samsung is rumored to be working on but got tired of waiting. I am really enjoying the light, small form factor of this 7" tablet though. So now I am not sure if I will want a 10" tablet or not. My brother has an iPad and that thing is a brick compared to this tablet.WiFi:I am a little worried about the people complaining about WiFi issues. So far mine has been working fine. It is indicating the same signal strength that my phone and laptop show. Maybe the problem is hit and miss but I hope if there is a real problem it is something a software/firmware update can resolve. But so far I have no complaints.Battery Life:I charged the tablet overnight and took it off the charger in the morning. I didn't use the tablet until I got home about 11 hours later. It was at 98% charge so it only drained 2% in 11 hours of no use. I used it for nearly 3 hours and it dropped to 66%. So 3 hours was about 1/3 of the battery life. That should translate to about 9 hours of battery life. I could turn the GPS off since it isn't needed most of the time, I also saw a tip about having it turn the WiFi off when in sleep mode and I have manually set the screen brightness to around 25% which is plenty bright indoors. Overall, I think it is going to have pretty decent battery life. I should get about 3 good evenings or a full day on a charge.**Update 5/21/2012**I have lived with the tablet for a couple weeks now and have a few more observations.Screen Sharpness:I got to compare it with my brother's iPad 2 this weekend and the screen on the Samsung is much, much sharper than the iPad. In fact, my dad's Nook was much sharper than the iPad with the Samsung being sharper than the Nook. The difference was amazing.Browser Speed:I was completely happy with the browsing speed of the Samsung until I compared it to the iPad. The iPad was much, much faster. Not sure why, but it is very noticeable. I installed the beta version of Google Chrome and it appears to be better than the built in browser but still not as fast as the iPad. But like I said, I was happy until I found out there was better.Connection Issues:I have observed the connection problem some people are reporting. If you hold the bottom left corner, the reception does drop down. As soon as you left off, it goes up 1 bar. But I also found out that my router was not operating at full strength. I had the old standby Linksys WRT54G but recently upgraded to an ASUS RT16N. As soon as I did, I noticed my cell phone and laptop were not showing nearly as strong reception as before. I am running Tomato on the router and discovered that you can turn up the signal strength. By default, Tomato is dialed back. My nearest neighbor is a quarter mile away so I dialed up to full strength. That upped my reception by 1 bar when covered and uncovered. So now I have better signal strength, even when I cover the antenna. I am not worried as I don't lose connection and it is showing a similar signal strength as my phone and laptop.Overall, I love this tablet.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Like the first review, I wasn't planning on buying this today...but after playing with the Fire and Nook and being underwhelmed with their performance, I almost left Best Buy empty handed. We stumbled upon this, and I loved it. My main problem with the other two was that they seemed very sluggish (compared to the iPad2 my fianc&eacute; has). This on the other hand, is finally a quick and responsive 7" tablet at nearly the same price as Fire. Apps just launch, graphic intensive magazine pages flow, and the touch screen keyboard is easy to use with my relatively large hands. What's more is you aren't locked into anything, get a very accurate GPS, a smart remote, bluetooth, and a nice and bright screen. I'm sure I'll be adding more praises as time goes by.Only issue I'm having is that the compass is always 90 degrees off, it always points West instead of North. Sounds like a software issue, but time will tell. When using the GPS enabled apps, North is dead on (as you'd expect). That's the only reason I gave it four stars (I'd actually rate it a 4.8 or something, but I had to point out the issue).

tablet_galaxy_tab|I am a newbie to tablets so I can't compare to many different tablets except the Kindle, which I owned for about 3 days. Got the Kindle for a great deal, $139, special 1-day deal, refurbished direct from Amazon, 1-year warranty. Couldn't pass up this deal. Played with it for about 3-days. Everything about the Kindle was OK. Nothing great, did everything as advertised.Then I saw the SGT 2 7 advertised. There were 4 things that appealed to me as upgrades from the Kindle. Extra storage capability (huge), camera, availabilty to full android market and ICS (the newest android operating system). I decided if I was going to have a tablet, I wanted something I would be happy with for several years not just the next 6 months. So I pre-ordered the SGT 2 7 from Amazon. Was told I would recieve on the 25th but was actually delivered on the 24th, nice suprise. Have played with it for 3 days now, very impressed. Gave the Kindle to my wife. She loves it. Now my wife and daughter can swap Kindle experiences, whoo hoo.Review:Overall, love the tablet. Everybody has different reasons to get a tablet. This is simply a play toy for me. Do not need for business. Not looking for or needing the best tablet on the market.* Look and feel are great, lighter than the Kindle. Not difficult at all to hold and read book for an hour or so.* Screen is good! Everything looks clear and sharp. Not the best on the market but definitly OK for the price. Watched Neflix movie last night, picture and sound were great!* Touchscreen very responsive, minimal delay in opening apps.* Wi-Fi is good. Goes down from 4 bars to 2 bars when I go upstairs. Does not seem to effect reliability much.* Sound is great. Cranked the volume all the way up and had minimal distortion. Better that expected for this tablet.* Love the ability to set my screens up the way I want (unlike Kindle)* Many more apps available through Google Play then Amazon's App Store. Big plus.* Camera sucks. But I generally take pictures with a real camera (remember those). Good enough to take some pictures when you forgot you camera or your cell phone isn't working. No big deal to me.* I have heard people complain about the proprietary cable. Really, get a get a life. Cable is used to charge and connect to my laptop to xfer video/music files to tablet. Works perfect.* Only real issue is the remote control app. Started Peel setup, recognized my Vizio OK, could not recognize DTV box though. After 2 trys, app loaded up email to send trouble tik to Peel, pre-loaded all info, I just needed to enter DTV model no. Received email within an hour from Peel advising they had received my email and would look into it. 72 hours later no response. Not a Samsung issue but dissapointed Peel doesn't support there product better.Overall, very pleased with the tablet and confident I will get many years of enjoyment. If your in the market for a good tablet to play games, watch movies, listen to some music or surf the net, you will not be disappointed with the SGT 2 7.

tablet_galaxy_tab|So I did a lot of research; I've been in the market for a tablet for 5 or 6 weeks. I really wanted to wait for the Asus/Google Nexus announcement, but I don't want to hang out that long on the hope that it will be announced and have everything I want. This tablet has almost everything on my list I'll detail out why it got a 4 from me in a minute.The GoodPretty responsive over all, and while some folks might take issue with the picture, I've never been particularly concerned that my device have the deepest blacks, and the most staggering whites on the block. You might notice a small amount of lag if you have tons of apps open (as I tend to do) and if you have a samsung/nexus smartphone as I do, you may notice the setup is not quite as set it and forget it as that. I am still looking for a couple of apps/widgets such as my photos from my google accoutn. I've heard other reviewers say that ICS seems a bit cramped on a device this small, and I can't say that I disagree, but for the most part it does what it says on the box and I imagine you'll run into the same situation on nearly any 7 inch tablet with a similar resolution. I wanted this device for Netflix when I'm on the road, Google Reader for cooking in the kitchen, and Evernote for taking notes in meetings. This does that and then some and you can't say that about the kindle fire. To me that's worth $50. I haven't run through an entire battery cycle yet, but so far it seems solid, moreso than my phone in fact due to the lack of cell connectivity drain.The BadAs I said, the GB of RAM, and downgraded processor are noticeable vs beefier models only if you have lots of apps open. Other reviewers have talked about the junky camera and I will echo that sentiment, though if you'd just doing instagram or something of that ilk I doubt you'll be disappointed.The Bottom LineI have no regrets about pulling the trigger on this device at this time. It does what i want, and I even got a logitech bluetooth keyboard. Easy to hookup. Easy to use. My wife took to it like a duck to water while watching TV last night. One other bonus, which I didn't know when I bought it was that it's incredibly easy to switch between accounts. If she has a recipe on her google reader, or in her email, the device is connected to both accounts at all times, so it's just a few taps to get there. Good stuff.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this recently. It is a fine tablet, except for one MAJOR flaw. You will never be able to do anything with your SD card other than use it to hold pictures and videos. Even books cannot go on the card. Instead, Samsung creates a fake SD card space inside your limited 4gb free internal memory, and any ap that wants to access the SD card is sent there. I am unclear if this can be circumvented by rooting the device. As far as I can tell, even those aps that use music and videos may have a hard time accessing the sd card to get to them. So far I have only been able to copy stuff to the card via a PC and then if it is music or video the stock built-in ap can see it. But I am not sure even the normal music and video aps (like podcasting aps) can even write to the card (although that may be something I can overcome, I am not sure).Anyway, I am forced to describe the SD card feature on this tablet as essentially useless. And I think most of the 5 star raters are people who have not yet discovered the SD card limitation.For those who think differently:In answer to questions concerning their SD Card, here is the answer direct from Samsung on their support site:We apologize for the delay in addressing your question. If we are understanding you correctly, are you asking if you can copy/store apps on an SD card? If this is the case, apps can only stored on the internal memory only. The only thing that can be stored on the SD card is pictures, music & video files.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Very impressed with Amazon's delivery on a SUNDAY, at that! I pre-ordered and assumed I'd get it on Monday or Tuesday with my Prime delivery, but was surprised at to see it at my door today!As for the tablet itself, so far it has been a breeze to use! Connected to my WiFi right away and it seems pretty speedy...of course I haven't bogged it down with a bunch of junk yet. ;-) I logged in with my google account and before you know it, my apps were all synched over while it was charging. I didn't want a full size tablet, this is much more portable, yet big enough to be easier to read than my Samsung Infuse for browsing, games and Kindle books. Love it so far!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I periodically review the comments on this product, and am disappointed in some of the reasons given for providing low ratings; therefore I am submitting the following general information and suggestions.The following is a response from Michael S. to negative feedback on the SGT 2 7, recently published by an individual on Amazon.Michael is obviously a very savy guy, as his comments provide numerous tweaks that every SGT 2 owner (and most ICS users) should be vividly aware of. This info will truly rectify most problems and help you get the most out of your SGT 2 7".-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edited by the author on May 2, 2012 6:55:32 PM PDTMichael S says:Right now my Tab 2 stats show the device is going 2 days 14 hours on a battery charge with 43% left. I use the Tab a few hours a day web surfing, doing research, checking and responding to emails. There are a number of ways to save juice so I'll mention a few that I use; which some, all, or none, may be applicable to others' situations:#1 - Go into "Settings", then "Wi-Fi". At the top right-hand side there is a icon of "3 bars and a small triangle" (basically an option button) click on it and when the "Advance" box shows on the screen, click it. Then click on "Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep" then check "only when plugged in". This will turn off the Wi-Fi when in sleep mode & running on the batteries. I use a login pattern to unlock my Tab and every time I unlock the screen it states "establishing Wi-Fi connection" I'm using WEP2 encryption on my network and the Tab starts Wi-Fi within seconds of waking from sleep. If one wants their Tab running multiple apps and to always have the most up-to-date information "pushed" to the device even while sleeping and running in battery mode, then one has to trade battery life for always-on information. The Wi-Fi will be active in sleep mode when it is plugged in. If you Always want the Wi-Fi off when in sleep mode then select "Never" instead of "Only when plugged in".#2 - I mostly use my Tab at home or at the office. I have both Wi-Fi network settings saved in the device, so I turned off "Network Notification" in the same area as # 1 above. This stops the Tab from periodically searching the Wi-Fi Network for "Open Networks". If I go out and want to connect to a Wi-fi hot spot, I simply turn this feature back on.Note: When you are in "Settings" and "Wi-Fi" mode you will notice that periodically the device shows "Scanning". Because you are in Wi-Fi mode, it scans to refresh the wi-fi networks its found, to help you connect to them. It does not continue to scan the network after you leave Wi-Fi settings, unless "Network Notification" is turn on, although the scan intervals may be different between the two modes.#3 - In "Settings" then " Location Services" make sure "Use GPS Satellites" is unchecked. This requires more battery and a clear view of the sky, and is really only useful outside.Those 3 settings will make a difference in battery consumption, and will not affect most people's use of the Tablet, although others' actual mileage may vary#4 - In addition, as I stated earlier, I mostly use my Tab 2 at work or home, so I always know where I am. Therefore, I also turn off "Use Wireless Networks" (Found in the "Location Service" section). This use Wi-Fi to help determine your location for Maps and such. If a App or Apps are running in the background and they have a location feature, this stop them from updating while the Tab is sitting idle, or your while your using other apps.#5- Because I use my Tab mostly at work or home and I know where I am, I usually turn-off GPS. Click on the "Clock" icon at the lower right-hand side, and then uncheck "GPS". If I ever need it, I quickly turn it back on.#6- In "Settings" "Account and Sync" I have "Auto Sync" turned off. I turn it on when it's plugged in and then have it Sync. Then I turn if off once its done charging and back on battery power. I usually sync only 1-2 per week, same as my Skyrocket.#7- Next, in "Settings" then "Developer Options" (I don't run a bunch of Apps and don't use a lot of "Notifications") so I check the box "Do not Keep Activities" This means when I leave an App, ICS closes the app instead of letting it run in the background, possibly sucking more juice. I saved this one for last, as it impacts the tablet operation the most. If a person uses "Notifications" or likes to multitask with many apps running and want to quickly switch between them, then thus option is not useful. What it does do is free one up from going into "Task Manager" and closing down a bunch of Apps you thought you closed but were only minimized when you exit-ed the App.#8- Lastly, Usually the biggest drain on the battery is the display. Currently under "Battery" in "Settings" the Display has consumed 65%, with the next closest item "Internet" at 19%, and "Android System" & "Android OS" at 5% each, with everything else at less than 5% combined. Unfortunately, I'm unable to recommend the "Auto-Display" mode, as for me, it makes the display too dark most of the time (click on the "Clock" icon and then check the "Auto" box to engage).I keep the display setting at about 20-25% as I mostly use the tab 2 indoors. As mentioned above, others' actual mileage may vary with Auto-Display turned on. I use Auto-Display on my Skyrocket, as I use it equally indoors and outdoors. When indoors, I find Auto-Display too dark also, but I live with it because when using the Skyrocket outdoors I find the Auto-Display is a must to see the display in bright sunlight, and therefore watch the battery drain accordingly. To compensation for this, I replaced the stock battery (1,850 mAh) with an extended battery (2,250 mAh) for a 22% capacity increase. This is obviously not a option on the Tab 2.(END OF QUOTE)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Let me add, in addition, If one buys this tablet expecting to play graphics intensive action games then that person will be disappointed. That is not what these 7" tablets are designed for. Also, be aware that this is a transition period in the development of Android software; wherein developers are having to convert their programs to the new operating system (ICS), and this has resulted in some minor problem being experienced on all phones and tablets converting to ICS. The fact is, however that ICS is a big improvement over the preceding Operating Systems; and the Galaxy Tab 2 7" is a very good tablet for the money. THEY ALL HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS!Hope this is of help!! I know it was to me, and I own five tablets.__________________CbillTransformers (2), Xoom, Nook Color (MicroSD root), Galaxy 7+(Returned),Galaxy Tab 2, Optimus V (root)

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tablet and I bought it mainly for college purposes. In addition to owning hard copies of my textbooks, I also have pdf files of them and needed a device I could save and open them (instead of lugging around 25 lbs of books). I also needed to browse the internet as some of my homework is online and needed flash support for the occasional cramster/chegg help. I HATE having to use the library's computers on campus. The people are a distraction, but I do not want to lug around my laptop or deal with it's crappy battery. So, I bought the Tab 2.First thing I did was log onto chegg and my heart sank when the solutions part of the website did not work. Once I found apps I realized I needed to download Adobe Flash Player. Done. Website now works properly.Next, I could not figure out how to connect the tablet to my pc. I tried using Samsung Kies with no luck. It would not connect. So, before I logged into Dropbox on the tablet, I emailed myself the links for the textbook pdf's. When I opened the links, the files were downloaded onto the tablet. I cannot figure out how to officially store them somewhere, but they are under "Downloads" so I can access them w/o internet connection.At first I opened the pdf's with Polaris Office and they were hard to navigate and some parts of the Calculus book did not display right. I opened with Amazon Kindle and soooooo much better! Easier to navigate and everything displayed correctly. Some of the text is hard to read with the tab in portrait mode, but is totally fine in landscape mode.So far it appears the tablet will work for the minimum I need it to do. I can now have my books in class w/o carrying them and can do my homework on the fly. I will definitely need to figure out how to transfer files and store them correctly on the tablet.The extra stuff seems to work fine. Web browsing, Facebook, Draw Something, etc. All mindless time wasters. ;)

tablet_galaxy_tab|Have been using a friend's iPad 2, and really like it -but- it's a PITA to carry around. I tried a Kindle Fire, and it fit in my back pocket, but it didn't do much other than read books. Amazon sold the little Android guy without legs: only Kindle Fire apps will download and run on the corrupted opsys.Enter the Samsung Tab 2. I ordered one, and have been using it for about a week, now. It does most of the stuff that the iPad did, and a thousand things the Fire was locked out of. I had very little trouble getting my head around Android 4; it's pretty intuitive. I added 32 GB of storage for $22. Apple would have charged $200+ more just for that. I can make and receive phone calls via WiFi and Skype. The Tab 2 is not a phone replacement, lacking a 3G/4G connection capability. I knew that going in, and I have a cellphone, anyway. Many users would require 3G/4G data for business and monkey business. Let them pay $40-$100/month for their data connection. I don't need it.Battery life seems quite good. I watched two movies and did a bunch of email/Facebook stuff, and it still had about 1/4 charge indicated. It connected right up to my home WiFi, and to several networks in hotels and restaurants, since. It's hassle free and intuitive.Does it work? Yes.Does it work well? Yes.Does it read books, do email, Facebook, web research, GPS, play music, show movies, do YouTube, take dictation, shoot pictures, take HD video, record sound, make Skype calls, and can I fit it in my back pants pocket? Yes.Does it look good? I think so.Will it be called 'awesome' by your friends? Maybe not. That's Apple's province, and built into their pricing.Does it walk the dog? Not sure - I don't have a dog.Does it play games? It says it can, but I'm not a gamer.Does it do porn? I'll have to get back to you on that.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I am what you would call a power user. I was looking for a 7 inch tablet after using and returning an ASUS Transformer due to its size and lack of video codecs. I needed a small tablet to read books, surf the web, play games, take class notes, and watch videos. After being disappointed at the Amazon locked Kindle Fire, not wanting to pay a high premium for an iPad, and the Nexus 7 lacking an expandable storage option, I found the Tab 2 7.0 a worthy tablet that hits all the points important to me.- Affordable. After being released at a good price of $250 this tablet has hit the magical $199 price point shipped on Amazon. An amazing price for what you get.- Launched with Android 4.0.4 but now has Android 4.1 Jelly Bean! This update has made the tablet quicker and much more responsive due to Project Butter. The layout has changed and is now more consistent between different devices. Google Apps are updated with better performance. Google Now shows cards based on your location and your Google searches. A much need update has breathed new life into this tablet. Update is available automatically on start up or via Settings, Software, Software Update.- Battery Life and Performance. I easily get 6.5 hours of "on screen time" for heavy use and have gone a couple of days without needing a charge. Over 8 hours for video (will vary due to brightness). An excellent duration. YMMV. With a TI OMAP 4430 Dual Core Processor, Performance is good. It is an older processor to keep the price low but is more than capable of running this tablet. No issues. Power Saver Mode provides longer battery without any noticeable decrease in performance. Brightness is allowed to be much darker than normal. Good for night reading.- Expandable Storage. With 8GB of internal storage and about half user-accessible, expandable storage is important for those with a big library of music and videos. I can store all my shows and movies on any size microSD. The tablet also plays MKVs, Xvid, and other important video formats with srt embedded or external subs support in the default Video Player and MX Player. Tested 720p. I am currently using a 16GB microSD Class 10 card.- Features. WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, Front and Rear Cameras(Google Hangout is great), Good Dual Core Processor (TI OMAP 4430), 1 GB RAM, 4.5GB user accessible internal memory for apps, microSD Slot, and an IR Blaster (Peel App controls my TV and DVR flawlessly(Samsung HDTV + RCN Motorola DVR)).- The Tablet. Great build. Good screen at 7" and 1024 by 600 resolution. Easy to hold. Lightweight.The cons that are easily overlooked- Proprietary charge cable (prefer microUSB)- Camera quality is not very good (I would never use a tablet as a camera... Good for QR Codes and video chat though!)Like I said this tablet hits all the points important to me. Couldn't ask for a more balanced tablet in terms of hardware, software, price, and features. At $199 as of Jan 16, 2012, I highly recommend this tablet.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Let me first say that this fell out of my bag a few days after I got it, onto the hard floor at school. I can't see any damage, yay Samsung. That said, I am getting a case for it. Basically this is a big Android smartphone, with Wifi access only.What its good for:1. Music2. Pretty good at web browsing, unlike a smartphone, you can actually see the pages.3. Playing games (the screen looks good to me when chopping sushi).4. Anything with Google.5. Thumb texting.6. Reading kindle books.6. Killing Zombies (Check out Dead Trigger, it looks awesome).What its not so good for:1. Typing papers.2. Microsoft office type stuff.Other things:1. Only 4.5 Gig of internal memory after preloaded stuff.2. Micro SD slot for movies, music, photos, but not Apps (usually not a problem.)3. Has GPS.4. You need an expensive HDMI connector to attach to your Samsung TV.5. Cord is short, you will likely want a longer one.As long as you realize tablets are not computers, you will be o.k. This is a nice size and a quality tablet. I got $50 off with the purchase of a Canon printer through Amazon. One-fifty was a great price.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this tablet! I purchased two right after the new year and they have been going strong since. Maybe that seems crazy, but I've heard some horror stories about off-brand tablets becoming crap within a few weeks. This tablet has a lot of internal memory and runs android. The battery keeps its charge well, and I haven't had any issues with playback of movies or music, and it plays apps perfectly. I have probably downloaded approximately 20 apps and the system hasn't slowed at all. The WiFi works well, when I take it away from home and come back, it is almost instantaneously picking up the signal. It almost never loses the connection, even when my ps3 or my laptop do.If you are looking to buy a tablet and you aren't sure which one to buy; decide what you want it to do first. Are you working or playing? Are you familiar with android or mac? Android is super easy to use, and the app store is very extensive, with tons of free apps. You need to decide how much you want to spend, long term. Apple products may be top-of-the-line, but they are priced accordingly, and so are their warranties, if you want one. Even after your initial purchase, you will still have to buy a case, possibly you might need a memory card, or a replacement power cord, and you might not want to pay $50-100. If you decide you want to go with android, now you have a variety of choices. Your first consideration should be WHICH version of android you want. This Samsung runs 4.1.1, but I've seen lots of off-brand that only have 2.1, and that OS came out a few years ago. The higher the number, the newer the OS and the better your tablet will work, and run apps especially. I don't recommend the 2.1, I used to have it on my phone and you can't save apps to external storage. At the very least, look for 2.3. There's also the kindle to consider, they run a certain android OS that has been modified for Amazon, and has exclusive rights on new adobe flash software. This is a definite perk for the kindle, but it was still out of my price range. Plus, while it can be so upsetting to miss out on the random flash ads (haha), the Samsung still plays videos from the internet just fine, as well as several different kinds of video files downloaded from a computer to the external card.After looking at the OS, you need to decide how much internal memory you want. The literal total for the Samsung is 4.49 gb. Of which I still have 2.90 gb free. Now, I am using 1 whole gb for apps, but I mostly play games and they can be large, and when you have this much memory, you don't have to constantly move them to your external card. I could potentially get a lot of that space back if I wanted to. Having enough internal memory is VERY IMPORTANT; you will want to throw your tablet in the street and crush it with your car if you don't have enough. It will constantly tell you that the storage is low, and you won't be able to even update your current apps. I would say, depending on your usage plans, you will want at least, AT LEAST, 2 gb, but even that's on the low side. If you are going to read, play games, and be on the internet a lot, you will want more.Next, decide how big you want this sucker to be. I love this 7 inch tablet, and I wouldn't want a larger one. Yet again it depends on what you want it for. I like that I can just throw this in my purse or school bag. The 10 inch ones are too big for my tastes.After these major considerations, here's the other thing about tablet buying that you may want to think about. My girlfriend received an off brand tablet for Christmas, and we looked, and looked, and looked for a good case for it. Nada. There are so many different tablets out now, a saturated market, while the accessories are about as easy to find as water in the desert; if you don't have a Kindle, an iPad, or a Nook. This may sound crazy, but in the end, what made me get this tablet was the fact that I could get a good, solid case made specifically for it, at a reasonable price. I was not going to spend several hundred (I bought 2, remember) dollars on tablets, only to break mine within a week. I'm a huge klutz, so I have to think ahead. This is a great tablet, I highly recommend it!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I started with a Kindle Fire and was sorely disappointed by how much it lagged, so I exchanged it for the Samsung. I am a HUGE fan of Samsung and have always felt they produce a good quality product. The Galaxy worked great ... at first. The camera in it was good, the surfing was fast (with Chrome), my apps ran a lot smoother than they had on the Fire, the battery life wasn't stellar, but overall I was happy with my purchase. After 3 weeks, however, I went to plug it in and it wouldn't charge at all. Luckily, I was still within my 30 day return window with Amazon and I simply exchanged it. That process was quick, they sent me a new one which arrived in a couple of days (I didn't have to wait for them to get the defective one). I got the new one, got it all updated, apps redownloaded and had it up and running in no time. That same night, I finished using it, shut it off and plugged it in to charge. Next morning, I go to turn on the tablet and its been completely reset to factory defaults, I had to re-enter my information, redownload the apps, etc. Figured it was just a fluke, but sure enough, the next time I turned it back on after turning it off, it did the same thing again. I packed it back up and sent it back to Amazon within 2 days of getting it. This time I've just gotten a refund. I am sadly disappointed. For the "value tabs" I felt this was the best one available, especially with the option to add a memory card (the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire don't). Guess, I'm waiting a little longer to find a great tablet.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I did a few weeks' worth of searching and comparing before I bought The Tab 2 7.0, and this tablet offers more bang for the buck than any other tablet in its size and price point. With the right apps, this tab really shines. I find the rear camera useful for bar code and QR scanning without issue using the free Barcode Scanner app (the one with a bar code icon with a red triangle in the center), and also use the Paper Camera, DSLR and Pixlr-o-matic apps which get the most out of the camera's abilities. While the rear cam is only a 3 megapixel, it's still useful. If I want to take better photos, I have dedicated cameras but this does quite well in a pinch, and will also shoot 720p video for those times when you're caught without a camera or camcorder. The front camera is useful for using Skype or other comm apps. The speakers sound remarkably well for being so tiny, but they are both at the end of the tablet while holding it landscape mode. Not a problem. Still, for listening while watching movies or Wifi FM radio (TuneIn radio app), I'll use either my Sennheiser CX400 or Audeo Phonak ear buds. I installed PowerAmp and am impressed with the sound quality while listening to downloaded music and FM; separation and imaging capabilities, even while plugged into my run of the mill Creative T20 speakers at work was startling. It was like having much better speakers! Video while watching streaming Netflix or converted mp4s is excellent and for a 7" screen, I didn't find the resolution lacking and the colors were saturated but not unrealistic, using the built-in Netflix app, the native video player app or MX Player Pro. I did not notice any light bleed and the blacks were black, not dark gray. It was easy getting caught up in a 2-hour movie while watching it on this Tab. Wifi connection is instant, both at home and on public networks and have not dropped any connections, remaining strong even while straying 50-60 feet from my home router. I think most issues with wi-fi is having "same channel" interference from other routers in the neighborhood, so I installed the free app Wifi Analyzer (if it's not here, check the goggle Play store), which will let you know what channels the other routers are using as well as signal strength, so you can plan accordingly which channel to use with your own router. GPS works fine; I was able to get 8-meter accuracy while using Goggle Maps. Goggle Sky is also fun to use. I also use GPS Test Plus from the Play store. eWeather HD by Elecont is an awesome weather app, also with HD radar and even earthquake features, and uses either GPS or you can punch in a ZIP code. I installed a SanDisk 32GB MicroSDHC card, and as for transferring data to or from the laptop, you can use either the supplied USB cable that comes with the charger, but I prefer using WiFi File Explorer Pro (also at the Play store) which provides an easy Web interface from a desktop or laptop, but it's only secure when using it at home (provided you're using an encrypted wireless connection, right?) which makes for easy transfers and avoids the hassle of having to use the restrictive length of a USB cable; ES File Explorer also works fine. As for moving apps to the external SD, it's not happening (yet) which can be an issue, since the ShadowGun game app alone is over 450mb once the data is downloaded for the game (and by the way, ShadowGun plays fine on the dual core TI OMAP processors on the Tab 2). There are also astronomical apps which can go from 500mb - 1GB with the downloaded data (SkySafari Plus and SkySafari Pro) so there is somewhat cause for alarm, as out of the 8GB of memory this tablet has, there's only around 4GB free when it comes new out of the box. I've checked the forums, and there is much concern regarding not being able to move apps from internal memory to the external SD (MicroSDHC) card. Some think it's a Samsung issue, while other think it's because Goggle (the developers of Android) wants people to use the cloud for storage needs. With Android releases through version 3 it wasn't an issue saving apps to the external memory card, but beginning with version 4 (Ice Cream Sandwich) the code changed as far as permissions went, so I'll quote Moderator Blast (thanks!) from the Galaxy Tab forum:"Turns out Google had for some reason since Honeycomb 3.2 decided to split the write permissions for the internal memory (the path of which is confusingly named /mnt/sdcard) and external SD card memory (the path being /mnt/sdcard/extStorages/SdCard) into WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE respectively.Apps to SDThe SD card is mounted r/w, but the owning group is media_rw which is linked to the WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE permission.Unfortunately, this permission was not required for access to the external sdcard prior to 3.2 so most file management utilities do not request it when they run...meaning they only have read access to the card. Before Honeycomb 3.2, apps only had to request for the permission WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and they would have write access to both the internal and external so-called "sdcard" sets of memory.Now, apps have to request for WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE if they want to write to the external SD card, but many of them have not yet been updated to do so yet. This affects file managers / explorer / compression utility type apps most often because users would tend to use them to copy / move / zip files within the file system. As for Ice Cream Sandwich, latest reports are that, yes, they are going to continue with this separate permission model.Hopefully in the future, more apps would have been amended to include the necessary permission/security settings." So as you can see, most developers are just not aware of this change while writing apps for the current versions of Android, but hopefully they will catch on soon. For now, the only way to circumvent some of the bloat is to root the tablet, but I see some users experiencing issues after doing this, and rooting the tab will void the warranty (not to mention the possibility of "bricking" it, or rendering it useless), and since Samsung hasn't made their stock firmware available as a back up solution, rooting for me is out of the question. The Tab 2 makes a fine e-book reader. The included Kindle app works well, and the text is very sharp, clean and easy to read - to the point where I've already read 5 books since having the tablet in less than a month. It's just a pleasure to read with. You can also turn off GPS, Wifi, Sync and screen rotation to save on the battery. The new 4.04 release for Ice Cream Sandwich released by Samsung this past week in an update also adds some power saving features and a few other enhancements (it shipped with 4.03 in June when I received it). As for Web browsing, I use Dolphin HD which is fast, allows me to keep multiple tabs open while not slowing down the browsing, and allows me to browse Websites in native Desktop mode (with the Dolphin Desktop add-on); otherwise some sites will sense that you're using a mobile device and causes frustration while having to view in a different style than what you're normally used to. But browsing the Web is fast and enjoyable; pinch-to-zoom is quick and effortless with no lag. YouTube also works and plays fine. Typing on a device this size can cause frustration or outright expletives (I've experienced both), and after much research for alternate keyboard apps, I downloaded the Thumbs Plus keyboard app (the Play store) and never looked back. It costs a few dollars, but rest assured it's very much worth it. It's a real joy to use, and a no-brainer with any Android tablet.Oh, and grab a matte finish (non-glare) screen protector; you'll find them if you look and it's really worth the time finding one, as it turns the screen from it's default mirror finish into a screen that's a pleasure to work with and doesn't affect brightness or clarity. I like it so much that when I ordered the Tab I also ordered the Skinomi screen protector, which has a gloss finish. The Skinomi is still sitting in the box unused.If I can think of anything else to add, I'll update this review. Until then, I'm very happy with my purchase of the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.EDIT 7/25/2012 - I've read some reviews where the length of the charging cable is short (and it is). What I've done is attach a ten foot USB extension cable between the end of Samsung's charging cable and the USB port on the actual AC charger and it works fine for charging (although I haven't tried copying or moving data) AmazonBasics USB 2.0 A-Male to A-Female Extension Cable (9.8 Feet/3.0 Meters). I find this to be a much less expensive solution rather than buying a Khomo 6' cable.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I've been an Android user for a long time...I was looking for a tablet to read some books and have a bigger screen for some of my applications since I'm a computer tech and I work using remote software and other applications...after a lot of research and having a Samsung Galaxy S2 phone for a year (and extremely happy with it) I decided to go for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0...Had it original for one day...second day I decided to root (running original stock ICS rooted) it to get the same advantages I had in my phone; like: CPU control, able to dim the screen lower than factory settings, uninstall bloatware, etc...After all the tweaks battery lasts 2.5 days (average of 4 hours a day of reading, browsing, playing games...plus receiving emails and using software for text messages), software works like a charm with no lag or freeze...widgets work great, been using the stock keyboard for now but looking for a more detailed one...charging time is normal for a large battery...screen size is great and device not heavy at all...screen resolution and colors are very clear and nice with a lot of details...tried a couple of movies and hi def pictures in it with great results...everything is really good...My advice and only concern use headphones for movies or landscape games because of the speakers placed at the bottom of the device.Overall 5 stars and great device!!!

tablet_galaxy_tab|Have owned an iPhone for 2+ years now, an Android 2.2 phone - and recently bought the Kindle Fire for my wife. I don't want to be locked or tied down - which is my experience with the Apple OS. The OS just works ... but I wanted more freedom. I am agnostic when it comes to operating systems.Here are my assessments on the Tab 2 after almost a week.Pluses:1. Screen is bright even at 50% which is my current setting.2. 2 cameras - front and back. Though I won't be using this for video calls soon, it is good to have the flexibility. For video calls, the resolution is good enough. I still plan on using a real digital camera for videos and stills. I want to have full control over the ISO, shutter speed, aperture etc.3. The micro-SD slot is a big bonus for me. My wife's Fire did not have this. For my use case - which is keeping all my files local, I need that expandability. I use google drive only for backup.4. Price is very competitive over the Fire (which I bought a week apart). Again, my wife wants an easy to use reader with the option of other 'screened' apps - so the Fire is perfect for her. For $50 more, I get 2 cameras, expandability - and more configurable experience.5. I was able to install the Amazon App Store (app). This will replace the Samsung one which I didn't find too appealing for someone who already has an existing Prime account. Now I get a free app a day!6. (Update) I just installed the Amazon Apps Appstore ... which basically gives me access (same look and feel) to the Fire's ecosystem of apps.Cons: (Not weighed)1. Charging is pretty slow - I am just used to my iPhone and Android phone with less than 2000mAH batteries - hence, faster to recharge. The Tab 2 came with a 4000+mAH battery - hence, it takes longer.2. Out of the box, you cannot load apps on the SD card. This is a limitation on the OS.3. Unless you change your power settings, the default settings will drain the Tab 2 pretty quick.4. The Samsung apps cannot be uninstalled individually. Some are good - others are so-so - luckily, they don't take up too much space - so until I find a replacement for all of the individual bloatware, I will keep them.5. The power switch/select button is too close to the volume controls. They should be spaced further apart as I have often inadvertently pressed it while simply holding the tab or changing the volume.6. Samsung uses a proprietary connector (unlike the Fire which uses a standard micro-USB).7. When charging, there is no indicator light to show that the battery is indeed charging (unlike the Fire). You would need to turn the tab on - and verify it is indeed charging.8. This is lighter than the Fire --- but still, for a 7 inch tablet, I expected something a little bit lighter.I am being picky here ... wanted to be as objective as possible.I did look at the Acer and Lenovo tablets over at BB. The Lenovo would constantly flicker - while the Acer had no power. But based on reviews and ratings (and the fact that I get ICS 4.0 at $249), I went with the Tab 2. For my use cases, this is the perfect tablet for me.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I started looking for a replacement for my 2 year old B&N NOOK Color a couple of weeks ago. One local store had the Nexus 7 and this Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. Another store had the Acer Iconia A110. My choice was between these 3. I will begin with the one that I first rejected.Nexus 7 - The Nexus 7 was perhaps the best compromise of the 3, but the large number of reviews on many shopping sites that described problems and poor support from Asus and Google made me eventually eliminate it. I liked the better screen resolution and the speed with the quad core processor, but no microSD slot and the reported problems and failures kicked it out as a choice. I didn't want to take a chance of getting a bad one and I didn't want to have to open it up to fix loose screws and such.Acer Iconia A110 - This one could have easily been my final pick, but the screen knocked it off. Just a relatively small amount of offset from straight on and the screen dimmed. It not only dimmed, but the colors also changed, which I read is common with TN screens. My 2 year old NOOK has a better screen in my opinion. It had the same quad core processor as the Nexus 7 and the same lower screen resolution as the Tab 2 7.0, so it was in the middle as far as those attributes. It also has a microSD slot.Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 - The Tab 2 falls short of the Nexus 7 in the processor and screen resolution. However, the Quadrant score is not that much slower than the Nexus 7. In one review site comparison, the Nexus 7 had a quadrant score of 3501, while the Tab 2 had a score of 2840. After loading all of my apps, I ran Quadrant twice and the lowest score that I got on my new Tab 2 was 3131. Not enough of a difference to matter. I found rooted NOOK Color reviews and they got Quadrant scores of around 950, so the Tab 2 is a big improvement over that.The Tab 2 has the following advantages over the others:- The screen is better than the Acer and even slightly better than the Nexus, even though the Nexus has a better resolution.- It has the memory expansion that the Nexus doesn't.- It has the best speakers by a small amount.- I managed to get it for slightly less cost than the other 2, but that didn't factor in my choice.So far I really like this tablet after only using it for 2 days. My microSDHC cards and OTG cable adapter haven't arrived yet, so I haven't been able to check out the functionality of those. I've loaded Firefox and side loaded Flash 11 and that is working fine with Jelly Bean. AirDroid works fine for transferring files over my wifi network. Even though I don't plan on using the Bluetooth capability, I will have to pair one of my headphones to see if it works.Some people like the simpleness of stock Android, but I actually prefer the added features of Samsung's Touch Wiz. I'd prefer not having the added Samsung apps, but I will just have to ignore them. I don't want to root the tablet, as I will probably just brick it.Once I check out the MicroSD and OTG cable when they both arrive in a week or so and check Bluetooth, I will update this review. So far I'm happy with my choice of 7 inch tablet.Update 2 days later: I mated my old Motorola S305 stereo headphones fine and they worked with no problems. I discovered that I had a long unused microSD - 256MB. I plugged it in and tried to load some photos using AirDroid and AirDroid would not find the external card. A Google search found that this is a problem with AirDroid with Jelly Bean, so not a tablet problem. I installed the wifi file transfer app and was easily able to transfer files to the external card. It's not quite as nice as AirDroid, but it works fine. I'm still waiting for the microSDHC and the OTG cable.Update 5 days later: I received the microSDHC and OTG cable. No problem with either. I used to OTG cable to mount a USB flash drive and a mouse. Both worked with no problem.Update 7 days later: I almost forgot about the GPS function. I just turned GPS on for the first time and loaded the GPS Status app. I'm impressed. It quickly (about 1 minute) found and locked onto 16 satellites while in the house. By comparison, my HTC Incredible 2 phone found no satellites in the same time and finally locked on to only 9 before fluttering between 7 and 9. I don't think that I have ever seen either my old Droid or my current Incredible 2 ever get near locking onto 16 satellites, even outdoors.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I received my Galaxy 2 7" tablet right before Memorial Day. I liked the device itself when I purchased it. It had a micro SD slot and had received pretty good reviews. The price was great as well. The device worked as expected for the first 36 days after purchase. It then started having issues. It started with random reboots. I was not worried as first as I throw a lot at my tablets. A few weeks later the screen would no longer come on. I tried all the tips and the device would not respond at all. I plugged it in and unplugged it and held the power key for about 60 seconds. The device would boot but as soon as the screen would turn off it would die again.I called Samsung and was told I needed to ship it back. They asked for a detailed description and I provided it and they sent a UPS label for me to ship the device back. About 2 weeks later I got an email that my device was fixed. The explanation of the problem was simply "Dead (Intermittent)" and the repair was "S/W Upgrade (External Factor)". A few days later my tablet arrived and I was shocked to see it was just stuck into a bigger box with no additional packing. When I removed the device there was an obvious scratch and it looked like the back had been pried off as there were small gouges. I fire the device up and the first time the screen went off, same exact issue! I plugged it in, waited a few minutes, unplugged and held the power button for 60 seconds and it came back on.I again called Samsung and was told I needed to ship it back a second time. I asked why as it did not seem like they did anything except wipe it and re install the software. I told them this was unacceptable that I had to give up my tablet yet again since no one fixed it the first time. I also questioned the cosmetic damage and was told "we are very careful with all customer devices". I said so what if it comes back and is still not fixed? I was told they may consider an exchange. WOW, thanks.If you get a good device you will probably be happy with it. If you have issues, good luck actually getting it fixed. I'm very disappointed in Samsung and the way they are handling this. At least offer me a replacement since they apparently can't fix mine. Not happy it was damaged either.UPDATE: I sent an email to the president of Samsung North America and got a call from someone in his office. She reviewed my case and said she would ship me a new Galaxy 2 7" tablet as soon as my old one arrived at repair. She assured me this would be a new, sealed device. Today she notified me that it shipped from CA today. I'm very happy that they went the extra mile for me. I will report back once I receive the replacement and ensure it is working properly. Nice job Samsung!UPDATE: I have been using the new replacement unit for about a month now. No issues with the new unit so far. As I recall, unit one went dead at 36 days so let's see if this one will works in a week.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my wife. I have a droid x (i put ICS on it) and she has a galaxy nexus. Prior to these phones we've had the droid incredible, iphone, droid 1, I also have had an asus transformer TF101 for a year and we've had an ipad1 ... so we have a lot of history with this tech although she is not a "tech" person, she just likes things that work and help her organize her life.The good:- nice hardware - the screen is nice and bright, the weight is nice [a tad heavy but not uncomfortable], the feel is greatThe bad:- the software modifications to deviate from stock android 4.0. they stink.Android 4.0 has a SUPER nice keyboard. Red underlines for misspelled words, spelling corrections .. the corrections are top notch. This is one thing android 4.0 nailed. Samsung TOOK THE ENTIRE THING AWAY!!!!They keyboard with the tab2 REMOVES the red underline, it REMOVES the spelling suggestions. In short it's TERRIBLE. I tried a few keyboard replacements with my wife but they aren't perfect, and honestly I don't want to mess around it with her since she (and I) just expecting it to be the default keyboard in android.On top of this HUGE issue, things are confusing with samsung's services and google's. My wife went to create a calendar appointment and it warned her that the appointment wouldn't be saved to samsung's services.... why do I care? It's a google cloud device? This confused my wife and concerned her, I told her to not worry about it because it was a samsung service but it would still sync to google in the end. WHY DO THIS?!?!?! Why confuse your users with 2 redundant services?If vendors are going to differentiate themselves, DO IT IN A POSITIVE WAY! Don't differentiate by confusing users, taking AWAY nice features, and putting together redundant services in ADDITION to the default ones and force the user to choose services when not really understanding or NEEDING to understand why there are redundant services to begin with.I'm most likely going to return this if my wife can't live without the keyboard working like android 4.0 works and we can't find a good keyboard replacement without trying 50 different apps. I chatted with a samsung rep via their website and they apologized but that was it, certainly no plans communicated to fix the keyboard issue.I'll consider the asus tf300 or wait for the rumored asus 7" tablet they are developing with google since I KNOW that will work as intended without confusing redundancies and a botched keyboard.It's a shame, the hardware is really really nice. It feels nice in your hands and looks sharp. But software is important too, and samsung screwed it up.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have an aging iPad 1, and have been looking for suitable alternatives. First I tried the Kindle Fire. It's a nice device, but the restrictions from Amazon make the iPad look positively open source. In retrospect, I think that for what a 7 inch device should do, it's a great buy. That, after having the galaxy for a month. I have an android phone, have had a rooted Nook Color, and a Wooted Xoom - so I think I've tested enough varied waters to avoid the inevitable fanboy accusation.I do have pros and cons for the device, but first I have to say that part of the difficulties I've had have to do with expectations. While I didn't expect a 7 inch device to do what a 10 inch device can (I do a fair amount of remote computing) I don't think that I had a good idea what to realistically do with the smaller form factor. At the end of the day, I think that the 7 inch tablet is best as a fancy e-reader, and to that extent, the Fire might be the better tab, more for what it doesn't do than what either of these devices can do with a lot of persistence. Perhaps it's best to have a restricted set of well performed functions in a limited space. I'm sure that depends on the user - I don't have to travel much, so portability isn't as big a deal as usability.Pros:Very thin and attractiveGood priceNice screen with accurate colorsCamera -I didn't use it, but it's thereMinimal bloatMicroSD slot (though it is a bear to insert a card in there)Video player was excellent, seemed to play everything, including mkvs.Cons::MTP instead of Mass storage was an absolute fail. It doesn't mount on XP or OSX, and really was a pain even on Win7 (it worked after I installed Kies). What I ended up doing was using File Expert on the Samsung and FTPing from whatever. Just silly.Wireless drops occasionally, usually on waking.Music - the native player doesn't read m4a's. You have to use something like PowerAmp, which is a great product. This isn't my idea of "open" especially when the video player can handle so many codecs. And while we're on this, Google music doesn't accept m4a's either. I don't understand this. Even Amazon will let me upload various music formats to their cloud player. I realize this isn't Samsung's fault. But still...ICS - still a mish mash mess of GUI. Even on a 7 inch screen, you are tapping in all different directions to achieve a goal. The basic soft-key elements are fine and usually helpful, but I don't get the immutable dock, the applications icon in the upper right corner, and the horrible screen capture icon (I think this was added by Samsung). And lastly, though I am clearly the only person bothered by this, is the blue line that permeates all screen elements (it's there to separate the dock from the main screen). It's there even for video. All the video and photos have a blue line on the bottom. Really?As an e-reader it was fine. Nice to have Kindle, Nook, Kobo, on the same device in one small form factor. Due to it's thin-ness, it is hard to hold for a long time, but I think a good case would help.I think that if I was going to take on this size device again, it would be more along the lines of the Fire - a limited device that performs a few tasks well, and leave the more complicated tasking to larger devices. My hope is that the retina display type screens start appearing on more devices which should improve the reading experience even more, and that my expectations for a small devices extend to reading, some video and music, and light emailing. It will be interesting to see how the Google Nexus tabs compare in a couple of months.

tablet_galaxy_tab|So this device just came out this morning, and I hadn't planned on buying it but I was down at my local best buy store and played with it just to see what it was and loved it! Let me say I used to have all apple stuff, apple computer, iphone, ipad, etc. Over the last year my apples have rotted, went bad and needed to be replaced. Instead of paying high dollar for all new apple stuff I went back to a windows PC, an Andorid Galaxy S2 phone, still had the iPad but it was in need of replacement.So I got to Best Buy they didn't have these out yet but they pulled one out and let me play with it while they set up the are for the demo unit to go. I liked it, very snappy, great screen. The device comes preloaded with ICS on it, it's VERY snappy with zero lag so far.The screen while not a retina display like the iPad is still clear enough for me. After all I'm not holding this inches from my face. if you do you get a chance to play with 1 of these before you buy go to the movies app on the device and play the life demo to see how clear and crisp the display is.It quickly synced up with my Google account and I was already able to start downloading apps from the play store within minutes of getting it turned on.So far this device is excellent. It feels like it's built well, the back is not as fancy as the Galaxy S2 phone however I plan on getting a case for this so the back battery panel to me doesn't matter much.I'll update this later after I get more time to play with it, so far though for $250 this is a great deal. I also played with the Kindle Fire and the Blackberry playbook both which were available for $199, but I opted to spend the $50 more for the Samsung as I've been impressed with Samsung quality over the years. (Currently my TV's, blu ray players, computer monitor, phone and now tablet are all samsung brand. They make good products in my opinion.)--UPDATE 8 hours later--I used the GPS on this earlier and google navigation/maps to get me to the hardware store. Ok I didn't NEED it but I wanted to test it out. I found that you MUST have internet for google maps to give you directions, I had a hotspot in my car so I turned it on and navigation worked perfect. If you don't have wifi you can still use GPS, it does lock on fast however it can't query to get you directions. If you used an offline GPS program like navigon or something that would do the trick, but YES gps is accurate and fast.I also used the bluetooth on this to stream music from the Tab 2 to my car, quality was excellent.Apps and stuff, so far every app I have tried is compatible with the exception of one, and I can't remember what that one was so it was one I really didn't use much at all I guess. I have put a few games on to test it, so far so good and still no lag.Hows the keyboard? It comes with stock ICS keyboard and it works well, if you start typing fast there is a tiny lag between hearing the click of the feedback and seeing the character appear, however all letters make it without any vanishing. I am looking for another keyboard though as spelling isn't built in it appears... I am probably switching to Swiftkey or swype both which appear compatible with the device.Also, the IR Blaster = awesome! I was going to buy a $100 harmony remote for my entertainment system, well this Galaxy Tab 2 has an IR blaster built right in and the application for it is simple to configure. Less then 3 minutes I had it set to turn my TV on, control my bose sound system and also control my Tivo HD and Blu Ray player. Very slick!More to come, if you have questions on how this works please leave them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them quickly. Also, if you find this review helpful please make sure to mark it as such!--UPDATE--Morning after, do I regret buying it? Nope, still a fantastic device and I'll tell you a few more things I found out.1. I use Dropbox on my home computer and put the app on this tablet. I also use a tivo at home and thought about how could I get my shows on my tivo to my computer then to my tablet? Well I use TivoToGo to transfer shows to my computer, then I place them in a drop box folder and they sync automatically to my dropbox account. I then on the tablet have an app (free and paid versions) called "Folder Sync" and I have that set to every hour check my drop box Tivo folder and download any latest tv shows my computer has copied. This means that in the morning when I leave for work my tablet has all my shows from the previous night I didn't get to watch on it so I can for instance watch one or two on my lunch break, without having to have a wifi connection at work!2. Need to make a phone call? Unfortunately this device doesn't have phone support. However Skype works great with both video calls and audio calls. You can pay for a phone number from skype (it's cheap if you wanted it) and actually treat this like a phone assuming you have wifi wherever you are. I did try google voice app, that will not allow you to make calls and use the tablet as a handset, it instead asks you what phone in your account it should call.---UPDATE 2/20/2013---I see a lot of activity on my review, big thanks to everyone that found it helpful and I love the activity. I wanted to provide an update. While I really liked Galaxy Tab 2, I did make the jump a few months back to the Google Nexus 7 and have to say that tablet has taken over as my primary device. The Galaxy Tab 2 and Nexus 7 ARE similar, however I really like the pure google/android experience that the Nexus provides. If you are on the fence, I would recommend going with the Google Nexus over the Galaxy Tab 2 at this point.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have a Kindle Fire and do enjoy using it (for the most part) -- love the form factor, enjoy the apps that I can get for it and am very pleased with the Kindle eReader app and ability to share books across all our Kindles. But when we were offered an opportunity to check out the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 a few days early, we jumped at the chance. The Kindle Fire is great at what it does, but its custom Android O/S, non-standard Web browser, limited selection of apps, lack of expandable storage and lack of Bluetooth support leave me cold.*Browser Issues*I've experienced multiple issues trying to browse web sites with the Kindle's Silk browser which work fine on the Galaxy Tab 2 and other full-fledged Android devices. Although Flash videos can be played on the Kindle Fire (if you enable Flash in the Silk browser's setting menu, which is OFF by default), Flash-based games on the Web such as Words with Friends and Bejeweled Blitz (both on Facebook) are painfully jittery and sluggish on the Kindle Fire. The native Words with Friends app does work well on the Kindle, for the most part, but not the web browser-based version. But Flash support on mobile devices is spotty at best so this is not the worst flaw in the Kindle. Also, the content management system we use on our web site is able to load pages (articles) on the Fire, but unable to scroll within large text input windows. The same problem does not occur on the Galaxy Tab 2's browser. The Silk browser is able to access many web sites properly, but when it fails, there isn't much you can do since updates to the Silk browser have been few and far between.*App and content space*The Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 each come with 8 GB of internal storage on board. Some of this is used for O/S and system files which leaves even less available for apps and media content. The Kindle Fire has no expandable storage, as it is designed to work in "The Cloud." In other words, they expect you to store music and movies on an internet-based cloud storage area for access when you want it. The big caveat here is that the Kindle Fire offers only WiFi access (no 4G support) so if you do not happen to have a WiFi hotspot or home network handy (like, for example, on a long distance car trip), your cloud-based content is completely inaccessible. I filled up the Kindle Fire's internal storage within the first six weeks of ownership. If I want to install more apps or add local content now, I'll have to remove some from the device. These apps and content are still available to download later from the cloud, if I wish to do so, but this really isn't convenient. The Galaxy Tab 2 also lacks 4G support (in its current version) but its standard microSDHC slot allows you to expand the on-board storage up to an additional 32 GB, which is plenty of room to move your movies, music and additional content to be stored locally without requiring access to the internet.*Bluetooth Support*When I am taking notes at an event or meeting, there's nothing like a full sized QWERTY keyboard. With the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, you can connect just about any standard Bluetooth keyboard and happily start typing away at full speed. With the Kindle Fire, since it lacks Bluetooth support, you do not have this option. Also, when you want to listen to music, movies or apps on the Fire without bothering those around you, you'll need to plug in a pair of standard headphones (with the jack awkwardly placed on the bottom of the device instead of the top). With the Galaxy Tab 2, not only is the jack placed more logically at the top, but you can also use Bluetooth 3.0 stereo headphones for high quality sound without the wired tether.*Cameras*The Kindle Fire lacks an on-board camera while the Galaxy Tab 2 includes both a front and rear-facing camera. Admittedly the camera on the Galaxy Tab can't really compare with a real digital camera (particularly indoors) but having the camera available on the Galaxy does allow you to snap a quick pic when the real camera may have been left at home, or participate in Google+ Hangouts (not an option on the camera-free Kindle).*Limited App Support*Amazon's Kindle Fire, like Barnes and Noble's Nook Tablet, is not compatible with the Google Play Store app market without rooting the device (not for beginners). To install apps on the Fire, you have to use the proprietary Amazon app market which has a limited selection of apps. There's no access to cool apps like the Logitech Harmony app, or the Samsung or Panasonic remote control Android apps for their TVs and Blu-ray players. The list of Android apps you can't get for the Fire goes on (and on... and on). And speaking of remote apps, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 comes pre-loaded with the Peel app which uses the Galaxy Tab's integrated IR port (another option not available on the Kindle Fire or Nook Tablet) to control an entire home theater or multimedia system *without* any additional out of pocket expense. It's there; it works; it's great! Also, if you want access to the Amazon app store from the Galaxy tablet, you can do this by downloading and installing the Amazon apk. I've done this and have been able to access my Amazon-purchased apps on the Galaxy tablet.Overall, I'd say the Kindle Fire is great for people who like to read Kindle books, who are satisfied with a smaller selection of apps, who like streaming movies and TV shows from Amazon Prime (as I do) and who don't need the extra flexibility of a full-fledged Android tablet. But for those who do want those extras - Bluetooth, cameras, expandable storage, Android O/S 4.0 - the new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 provides an excellent upgrade for a minimal amount of additional cash. Highly recommended.You can read our comprehensive reviews of the Kindle Fire, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and Nook Tablet on Big Picture Big Sound.2013 update: This review was written in April, 2012 and is based on a comparison to the first generation Kindle Fire which was the only Kindle fire that was available at that time. The Kindle Fire HD does address *some* of the limitations of the Kindle Fire including adding a front camera, mic and Bluetooth headset support but there's still no access to Google Play Store unless you root the device. Also, there is still no extended storage option (e.g., microSD card) on the Fire or Fire HD as there is on the Samsung tablet.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a brand new product from Samsung that breaks the $250 price barrier. There are a lot of tablets at or below this price but they are mostly very low end devices with slow CPUs, poor screens and built for non-US markets. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 makes none of the compromises typical of this price point and provides the same kind of performance you'd expect from the rest of the Samsung Galaxy Tab portfolio. It's fast, slick, has a great screen and even has Android 4.03 (Ice Cream Sandwich). I do like the new operating system and adapted to it in minutes. In addition to front & rear cameras there is bluetooth and even an IR blaster so you can use it as a remote for your TV. It only took a minute to set that up and get a program guide downloaded. All the apps on my Gingerbread phone loaded up to the Tab and run fine on the ICS platform. I can't comment on battery life yet as I plugged it for the initial charge and setup and haven't run on battery yet. As far as WiFi reception goes, it picks up all the same signals at the same strength as my laptop so no problem there. If you've been waiting for a 7" tablet with Android 4 your wait is over.UPDATE: Now that I've had it for about 10 days I can report that battery life is very good. After being online for several hours the battery still had more than 70% remaining.

tablet_galaxy_tab|It was my birthday and my family asked me what I wanted. I decided a new toy would be nice.My needs are minimal as I'm at my desktop much of each day, but occasionally like to read from my Kindle, surf for deals on Amazon, watch a Netflix movie, listen to music and email. I have accomplished these things with my Android phone, but slowly using 3G and a 4" screen.For a tablet I wanted a 7" screen, camera w/ video capabilities, responsive operating system, expansion capabilities with a microSD card, and a built in GPS, not dependent upon wifi or 3G. I found all of that in the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. Not the fastest OS (Google Nexus 7 will have the 4.1 Jellybean) or the fastest processor or the very best screen resolution, but 'very good' which translated into a good compromise between features and price for me. Not an iPad... but not meant to be one either.What I like about the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2...1. GPS navigation worked well and was fast to locate satellites, making it a good choice for the person who likes having a GPS, but rarely uses one except to locate somewhere to eat lunch in the city. (Like me!)2. Has more features than the Kindle Fire, Full Color 7" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi - which I also own - and with the free Kindle app still allows me to take my books with me. The viewing experience is the same as both have similar screens in clarity and size.3. The 3.0MP rear facing camera takes good pictures and video. Not the best I've seen, but certainly as good or better than my LG Optimus Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile).4. The weight is substantial - you know you're holding it - and the build quality is excellent! Buttons (rockers) feel solid and are easy to find.5.Touchscreen swipes are smooth and transitions move quickly.6. Wi-fi is easily found and connected.7. Screen is bright and clear. Adjustments to brightness easily made in 'Settings'.8. Watching Netflix and Amazon On Demand movies was lag-free and enjoyable. I was a worried about it not being as clear as I would like, but due to the 7" screen size, there was no problem at all. I've seen the iPad display and while it's not that tight, it's very good.9. Good battery life. If you put it on 'Airplane mode' in settings, you'll get even more life out of your juice!10. Came with lots of apps installed: Netflix, Gmail, Google, and more, as well as useful widgets for weather and calendar.11. Charging went quickly and easily with the adapter that allows for USB or AC charging.12. Web browsing was quick n' easy, as was emailing with this tablet.13. This tablet has Bluetooth! I have a bluetooth headset that I pair with it: LG Tone - HBS-700 Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange which also works with my LG Optimus phone. I can use it to do Google Talk calls - long distance for free via Gmail's interface. The tablet has a built in microphone on the front and you can use regular headphones for Google Talk, or you can use the one on your Bluetooth.What I wish was a bit better...1. I would love it if Samsung was to offer an OS update to 4.1 Jellybean to make this thing fly! 4.0 Android Ice Cream OS is quick and when I received this tablet I immediately went to 'About' and clicked 'Update' - receiving the 4.04 update for Ice Cream. The update requires a reboot of your system and you may lose data, so good to do it right out of the box. Made a nice improvement in the tablet's speed after the update!2. Again, the Nexus 7 will have a faster processor, faster OS and better display 1280x800 pixels, but the 1.2 forward facing camera n' no expansion slot were big issues for me. The Samsung doesn't have those 'fast' components and yes, I wish it did, but then I remember the price point.3. Not much documentation came with it. Undoubtedly it's either on the device or online, but sometimes you just want to read a good book or have it handy for reference.4. Internal memory gets eaten up quickly by apps, but multitasking isn't this tablet's strong suit - or my expectation.5. No HDMI or USB ports, but it does have Bluetooth and can act as a remote control with included app via infrared.6. GPS - yes, I put it in the 'like' area too, but truthfully it's more of a slow toy on this tablet than a GPS replacement.I am pleased with 2 accessories I bought for this tablet: MoKo(TM) 360 Degree Rotating Detachable Cover Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 7-inch Tablet, Black (with Vertical and Horizontal Multi-angle Stand) which fits this tablet perfectly - allowing for access to all the ports and protecting it while also allowing horizontal or vertical viewing, and [Ultimate Clear] Ringbo Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 New Release Tablet 7" Screen Protector Cover Film with Warranty which while tricky to apply, also fits perfectly.I also bought a SanDisk 32GB microSDHC Memory Card (Bulk Package) for it, which inserted easily and was recognized as 28GB of useable space by the tablet. *FYI... it's not uncommon for any storage to be recognized as less than the stated size after installation.Charging the device out of the box and then updating it immediately made using it the best it could be upon first use. I will be installing an app to do basic clean-up of the memory cache and an antivirus. There are several free options for both.Being my first tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 doesn't have big shoes to fill in my life like if I was an iPad user. I don't think anyone with an iPad would find this tablet interesting at all!For those who want portability, with more functionality than the Kindle Fire and a tablet with good speed and expansion, as well as a camera and video taking capabilities - this is a very good choice at an affordable price.RE: AppsIf you want to install the Amazon Appstore on your Samsung Galaxy Tab 2... you have to go to www.amazon.com/appstoreapp and download the app. Your tablet may say 'no' and block it. If so, go into 'Settings', 'Security' and under 'Device Administration' make sure the box for 'Unknown Sources' is check marked. The tablet will caution you that this makes your private info vulnerable, but in reality all it does is open up other another Appstore (other than Samsung's which is installed on the device) for you.Once you do this you should be able to download and install the Amazon Appstore and use it. That works well for me as I have several apps already that I use on my Android phone and Kindle Fire, which can also be used on this tablet.I'd suggest adding some of these apps I found useful and/or fun picked up at the Amazon Appstore. Most, if not all, are free.Remember that every day Amazon offers a new app for free. They are paid apps that for 1 day only, Amazon offers for free download. Sometimes, they are apps valued at $10 the day before, so it's definitely worth checking frequently!Here's a not so short list of 25 of my favorite apps for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2:1. Temple Run - fun game at the top of the iTunes app charts.2. App 2 SD Pro - to make sure you get the most out of your microSD space.3. Angry Birds Free - nice time waster!4. Fruit Ninja Free - another fun time waster.5. TextPlus Free Texting + Group Text - get a free texting phone number and text via wifi.6. AVG Free - antivirus for your tablet.7. MyFitnessPal - diet and exercise tracker.8.Cozi Family Organizer - works really well and your whole family can use it.9. E!Online - fun to keep up with entertainment news.10.EasyPrint - print from your tablet to wifi enabled printers.11.EasySudoku12. ESPN ScoreCenter13.Gemini App Manager - easy, fast way to make sure apps are not soaking up memory.14. HootSuite - love it for Tweets.15. Old Time Radio Player - just fun to listen to the Lone Ranger!16. OfficeSuite17.Official Ebay Android App18. PicShop - edit photos.19. Scanner Radio - listen to EMT and Police scanner traffic.20. SwiftKey 3 - makes texting and typing much faster with intuitive type by swype.21. TuneIn Radio - what it says...22. Star Chart -check out constellations.23. iHeartRadio - like Pandora (also available), create custom radio stations.24. Antivirus Free or Avast! - keep safe while surfing.25. NBC Nightly News - in case you missed it!UPDATE: 8/29/12Still really enjoying this tablet, and finding more reasons to recommend it every day. For the speediness of it, size and features, it's really a great buy!UPDATE: 12/2/12Disappointing... the Galaxy is dead. Started not holding a charge, then wouldn't turn on, and finally wouldn't charge at all. My use with this tablet has been about once a week for about an hour. Not exactly hard on it, so I'm a bit bummed. I did run an update prior to this happening so I'm not sure if it's a bad update or the hardware. Either way, dead in the water and will be contacting Samsung for warranty repair or replacement.

tablet_galaxy_tab|EDIT 03/16/2013)Having owned this tab for almost a year now I thought I would offer an update. Basically, I still think the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is a fantastic tablet. At current price of $179 it is an amazing value. Sure, you can get generics for $100 less, but they wind up being a bit of a crap shoot. I have tried a couple. I always wind up frustrated because things just don't seem to work they way they should, and it is often difficult or impossible to get firmware/software updates Then when you do the update process can be complex and scary. Samsung has been very good about updates. We even got Jelly Bean a month or so ago. The update process is dead simple. You get a notification an update is available then it is delivered wirelessly whenever you are ready. Other than making sure you have a good battery charge before starting, you don't have to do anything special to update.I do not use any of the Samsung apps like Music Hub, etc. It would be nice to be able to uninstall them to free up the space, but that is a minor quibble.Another minor quibble is the proprietary dock connector. I would prefer a standard micro USB port like my Galaxy Note phone. Oh, well, at least there are relatively inexpensive adapters to allow the use of USB devices.One caveat, the Tab 2 7.0 does NOT have HDMI video out capability (or any other video out that I can tell). Period. There is an HDMI adapter for some of the other Galaxy Tabs, but it does not work with the Tab 2 7.0. I do not really care about this, but if you do, just be aware. If anyone learns differently and verifies it with personal experience, PLEASE let me know.ORIGINAL REVIEWOK, I have put off posting a review because I thought all of the 5-Star reviews had already raved about the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7 sufficiently. But I have been seeing too many low ratings that I consider unjustified so here it is. This is such a great tablet I will simply try to counter some of the major cons that keep coming up. As background, I have owned or extensively used an iPad, 4 Android tablets, and 4 Android phones. I do not at all claim to be an expert with Android; I am still a bit puzzled by many things. But I have used enough Android devices, from 1.6 to 4.0 to have a bit of familiarity with the OS and devices that run it.As I mentioned, I do own an iPad, though my wife has stolen it from me. I bought the iPad strictly to make sure she would be able to use it easily anyway. But its loss meant I HAD to get the Android tablet I wanted to begin with, right? Thank goodness because I am NOT an Apple fan. Even I, an admitted Apple NON-fan has to admit that Apple devices work and work well. Even to me, the iPad is the gold standard for tablets.Battery life - this tablet has GREAT battery life, but you do have to practice reasonable power practices. I charged mine overnight one night, unplugged it in the morning, used it, admittedly very lightly, and after 4 days battery still showed 75%. I purposely used the tablet very lightly during this time since I was concerned with standby time. Read Michael S' comment regarding power saving steps here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EL7PM4TA0S2R/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R3EL7PM4TA0S2RWifi - Many have reported wifi issues. I don't think this tablet has a wifi problem. In fact, it has the best wifi performance of any Android tablet I have tried, consistently showing at least one "bar" more than any other. If you have wifi issues try powering your router off and on or unplug then re-plug. I have ATT Uverse, and I have to do this EVERY time I try to connect a new device. Every new device gets "Obtaining IP address from..." or "Connected"/"Disconnected". Even when I had cable and was able to use my own router I had to do this occasionally. The Galaxy Tab 2 7 has wifi performance equal to or better than any of the numerous devices I have used.Move apps to SD - No, as far as I have been able to determine you may not be able to move apps to sd even with App2SD or other such app. But the device seems to have a TON of system space for apps - far more than normal users require. Older versions of Android set aside System Storage for apps that might be 256, 512, or, if you were lucky, 1024MB. On the Galaxy Tab 2 apps seem to be installed in general storage. Apps space appears in the Total Space. Right now, for instance, my Total Space area says apps are taking 533MB and shows 3.86GB available. So how much apps space do you need? If you are super-gamer and need a bazillion GB of apps space, then no, this device might not be for you. So go spend $400-500 on something else. If you are a mere mortal, like me, I am pretty sure you will be EXTREMELY happy with this device.Oh, yeah, the Tab 2 has only 8GB of internal storage. I have never cared about internal storage because I immediately stick a 32GB micro SD card in and make sure photos, music, and videos get stored there. This tablet will accept a USB OTG adapter so you can store unlimited extra videos on flash drives. Speaking of OTG adapters, you can get less expensive ones, but this one is really neat:http://www.amazon.com/GrayBean-T-Flash-Keyboard-Connection-SamSung/dp/B0072FJEA8/ref=sr_1_cc_3?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1336783341&sr=1-3-catcorrI bought one, and I can attest that it does work with flash drives. I just got it and I imagine it will do fine with a USB keyboard. It has THREE USB ports plus slots for SD and other memory cards. Sorry, haven't tried those yet, either. It also has a power input jack for supplemental power, but I don't seem to have a plug that fits. I will do more testing and post a review for that product soon. I also have this onehttp://www.amazon.com/Black-Female-Adapter-Samsung-Galaxy/dp/B005YWIRBS/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1336783341&sr=1-2-catcorrand I can attest that it works, too.Oh, it is not yet available on Amazon, but Samsung makes a Book Cover that is the perfect case for the Tab 2. Just Google Galaxy Tab 2 Case and you will find it. It adds almost no bulk. I can still put the Tab in my pocket. It is a little pricey right now from reputable sources, but if you decide to go with one of the less expensive places make sure they actually have it. If you dig, many will say deliver something like 6/23. Just be careful. Another note on this case - it "opens" to the right in portrait orientation but that is so it will open to the top in landscape. It folds all the way back for one-hand use, and the edges have tacky rubber strips so you can use as a stand at the angle of your choice. It is very secure as a stand. Will not slide at all. CAUTION: The Book Cover that Amazon has right now is for the original Tab 7. The back of the Book Cover case snaps on so the fit has to be perfect. I don't think the Book Cover for the original Tab will fit the Tab 2. I got mine from OD.This is, hands down, the best basic Android device I have tried. It is definitely the 7" tablet I have been waiting for. Everything works, and works without spending hours researching how to get some feature to work.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had the original Galaxy Tab 7 for about a year. It love it. 7" is the perfect size to bring along to read a book or watch a movie. It is large enough to be able to pull up web pages (even in "full Site" mode) and actually read them. I have used that old work horse every day that I've owned it.So Why did I upgrade to this version when I love the original so much? 2 reasons. This one has Android Version 4.0 (I need this for a camera remote control app - DSLR Controller) and I liked the idea of a built in remote control for my AV system.So the verdict? -- I love it. It is sleeker than the original. A beautiful bright and vibrant screen. Good Battery life (so far). and very peppy thanks to it's dual core.Things I love:Price:----- Way to go Samsung. Very affordable for what you get.Size:------ This thing is perfect for book reading, watching movies on a plane, and just carrying round without it feeling too big.Screen:---- Like I said, this think looks greet for media like movies and pictures.Build:------ This thing is solid. I have been very impressed with Samsung latelyRemote:---- I LOVE the remote on this thing. I quickly set up with me home theater system (TV, Cable Box, Receiver, DVD, etc) The built in app stepped me through the process. and now I can tweak to my heart's content. This is better than my Harmony remote, because I can make updates right from the device without having to hook up to the computer. It also give a live schedule of what is on with single touch access. Better than the guide button on the cable box. Did I mention I love this app??Android:--- Version 4.0 - Great tablet OS. Like it much better than iOS. I love apple product, but never bought into the apple ecosystem, so I prefer Android.Kies:------ A cool way to wirelessly transfer data, pics, files, etc. between your Tab and a computer just using a browser. Very Slick, you will like it.Things I like:Camera:---- The shooter on this is OK. Plenty of pixels and shoots well in good light. it is OK but not great. Not an issue for me since I never used the camera on my old Tab. There is also not a built in flash. OK with me at this price point.Things I don't like:Proprietary cable:-- OK, I had to think hard of something I don't like about this. I prefer when micro USB is used for everything from Charging to Data transfer. However, I have a couple cables from my original tab, so again, not a deal breaker for me.I will update when I've had more time to try this thing out, but so far, I am impressed.If you do not have a 7" tab, and are looking to get one - buy this. you will not be disappointed!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I was a heartbeat away from buying a B&N tablet until I saw that this tablet was about to be released. I have to say, the wait was worth it.My main use for this tablet is for multimedia on the go. This tablet can do all of that and more for a low price and it can do so much more than the B&N tablet without rooting it. Within a few hours, I had downloaded enough apps from Google Play to customize this tablet to my liking.First of all, my comics on the 7 inch screen are bright, vibrant and very easy to read (see uploaded image in product picture gallery). The Perfect Viewer app works very well with this tablet. Now all my comics are available on the go.Netflix comes pre-installed with this device. After a quick update, I was signed in to my account and watching shows and movies. Sadly, Huluplus and HBOgo are not supported on this device, but that's the apps' fault, not the tablet. It probably won't be long before they will support the Galaxy Tab.The Peel smart remote works on my tv just fine. I can control the tv, though it doesn't support my cable box, just yet. Again, it's a fault with the app, not the tablet. The app was nice enough to automatically give me the option to send an error email to the developers.Sites like mangafox look great on this screen and the ability to zoom in and out on frames with a quick gesture is great.The Kindle app comes pre-installed on this device. I also loaded the Nook app. I was able to download all my ebooks from that account. The page turns are much faster than my old Nook ebook reader and the words read very well.Once I installed flash player, I was able to watch videos on websites both on the stock internet browser and on Dolphin Browser.I cannot be more happy with this device.

tablet_galaxy_tab|If you are looking for a 7", well-functioning, affordable tablet to surf the web and consume content then this the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is one of the best options out there. I own a Kindle Fire and love it. It is all that I need when I'm ready to relax in the evening. However, the Galaxy Tab gets the advantage for being a budget media tablet. Here is why:1) Hardware: Slightly lighter, slimmer. The Fire is a little easier to grip because of the back, but this is lighter to hold and carry. Front and back cameras. Who cares if they aren't the best because the Fire doesn't have either. Volume rocker makes volume adjustments simple.2) Software: This is my first Android device and it runs smoothly and I haven't had any problems. There are a plethora of options for customizing this device to your needs.3) Applications: No longer restricted by Amazon's App Store so you get to experience new apps that everyone is talking about sooner.4) Media: Still have access to books and videos from Amazon either through Amazon Kindle app or Amazon's website. In addition, you now have access to Google's app, videos, music, games library. A strong ecosystem is important in the long run and like Amazon and Apple this device has that with Google.I gave this device 5 stars because if you're looking at this tablet then you probably don't want to spend a lot of money and you want a smaller tablet. This is one of the best options out there.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I've been hunting down a 7" tablet since I saw the specs for the ASUS MeMo 370T and was happy to see this Samsung unit beat Google to the punch.Overall the tablet has a great form factor and is a pleasure to hold for hours on end. Obviously anyone expecting an iPad experience out of a 7" Android device will be disappointed. Luckily I've been looking for a tablet to augment my iPad.I bought this tablet primarily to use around the house for reading RSS feeds, doing light web-surfing and to check e-mail and my task manager (Springpad).For the most part it does these tasks well though I have noticed some issues with scrolling through lists of news articles and longer web pages. It's just a little glitchy and not as smooth as the Nook Tablet I tried earlier this year.My main concern is battery life. I have never seen a device suck down the juice quick as quickly as this one does. It seems to use 3-5% per hour rendering the idea of multi-day stand-by moot. What I've noticed is the wi-fi indicator says there's traffic almost constantly.As a test I stared at the launcher (no widgets installed) for a minute and during that time wi-fi was almost constantly in use. I'm sure this has something to do with the poor stand-by performance but for the life of me I can't figure out WHAT would using wi-fi that much in the background. When I check network statistics I see the ever helpful "System" uses the most bandwidth.While using the tablet I am perfectly happy with battery performance. I was pleasantly surprised the other night to have only dropped to 63% after 4 hours of pretty continuous use. The following morning I was down to 44% and by the end of that 9 hour work day the tablet was dead. This seems very odd to me and is likely the fault of the Android OS moreso than Samsung.The other issue I've had is that tapping alignment seems a bit off. About 35% of the time I think I'm tapping on one icon or selection and a different item is selected. This reminds me of the old Palm days where one could re-calibrate the digitizer if it started getting out of sync.At present I'm not sure if I'll be keeping this tablet or returning it and waiting for the Google Tablet this summer. The issues I'm experiencing may be SW related so I'll be keeping this unit for a few weeks to see if Samsung updates to resolve the issues I've seen.I'd have given the device four stars but the stand-by battery issue really bothers me. I didn't see it on the Nook Tablet and am at a loss in trying to track down what system process could be eating so much battery.

tablet_galaxy_tab|We have the latest Apple's iPad 3 at home but one thing I needed for my personal use was for email and having something that's more compact to carry around. As much as 10" tablets are nice, they are still hefty and aren't the easiest thing to type on especially on non-Android system (lack of aftermarket keyboard option for example). I've also added some in-depth review towards the bottom.Pro's:- Lightweight slim tablet- Excellent speed with dual core 1GHz processor to run latest application with no problem- Excellent device to watch HD videos on YouTube and Netflix- Smooth screen transition and snappy response- Great browsing and gaming experience- Flash is enabled- Good battery life overall- Bluetooth enabledCon's:- Subpar pixel density including color saturation- Some bloatware loaded by Samsung you can't uninstall- Slim but very slippery to hold- Proprietary data/charging plug like the iPadWhat this Tablet Has:- Latest Ice Cream Sandwich (aka ICS) operating system- 3.5" audio jack- Power button and volume up/down button- SD card slot- Infrared port- Proprietary plug for charging and data sharing- Front and rear camera- Internal GPS- Comes with A/C wall charger- 8GB internal storage, option to add up to 32GB with SD memory cardWhat this Tablet Doesn't Have:- HDMI, Firewire, or USB port of any kind- Removable batteryDesign Impression (4/5):The design is slim and lightweight like many 7" tablets. It's slim enough it'll slip into your back pocket but of course with some bulk due to its width/length which is a given. Everything is flush in design except the power button and the volume button located on the sides while I found pressing those buttons by accident often. It doesn't seem to stick out much but wish Samsung had made them a bit more flush with the case. The back side isn't perfectly smooth but not enough to give you any sort of grip. Holding it, I can feel it slipping sometimes. I have large hands (XL for gloves) and even then the back side alone felt slippery which I'm going to buy silicone case for it soon. Overall, it's simple and lightweight design if you prefer something compact. Much easier to carry around than a 10" tablet; this will sure fit your backpack, purse or any small compartment without an issue.Interface (5/5):Ice Cream Sandwich aka ICS is the latest operating system. What this means is slick but simplified interface that run smooth. I do like the ICS a lot compared to Froyo, Gingerbread and Honeycomb I've used in the past (see the alphabetic naming pattern Google uses?). ICS does tend to require more processing power but this tablet does so very well with this dual core. Geeky talk but basically it has more horse power under its hood. Screen transition is smooth, can add multiple screens while you can also drag icons together to put them in a folder.Typing (4/5):By default it doesn't actually come with the popular Swype. I did already purchase SlideIT keyboard with my phone so I've downloaded and enabled it since (if you've purchased apps from Play store, you can re-download them with your Google account no problem). In landscape mode, believe it or not, thumb typing is 'okay' and is a bit wide to type even for my large hands. Portrait mode you can type pretty quickly. Of course with the Swype like typing it could be done much faster. I like Android's way of being able to install aftermarket keyboard. This is where I found the iPad 3 to be bulky and cumbersome to type on as much as their keyboard is generally intuitive and easy to type.Storage (4/5):8GB is okay but with system and other application already taking space, that 8GB can be filled very quickly if you start to load pictures and videos. Of course with this capability to add up to 32GB SD memory it's not a bad thing either. Nowadays SD memory card is low in price and can store quite a bit (you may not need it the memory if you're only browsing, playing videos and adding just apps).Speed (4/5):Dual core, 1GHz processors which gives this tablet a great processing power. Sure, it's not quad-core but it's hard to slow this tablet down. The only time I noticed any sort of lag is playing game and try to open another application right after. But the lag wasn't enough to disappoint. It's not snappy like the iPad 3 but for $250? One fast tablet that won't disappoint.Screen (3.5/5):The screen resolution is something to be desired. If you're using a tablet for the first time you obviously won't notice a difference. But if you already have a device like the iPad or device with better screen resolution that pack in more pixels, you'll notice right away it's an okay display. The color saturation also seems to be lacking and could use some help with the contrast. The icons also doesn't use the whole screen; probably for the reason being so people can hold the tablet which will end up putting their thumbs on part of the screen. That could all be corrected downloading apps like "Go Launcher" which will give you a customized interface with all sorts of skins and wallpapers that are free also. Again, for a $250 tablet it's not a bad screen either.Audio (5/5):Loud. It'll even give you a warning when you max out the volume about a hearing damage. Though the speakers are located only on one side, you can hear the audio perfectly fine with TV playing in the background. It maybe a plus if you like to use tablet and other device as a music player. No audio distortion when playing music and movies.Video (5/5):I tested HD videos with Netflix, YouTube and few other application to see the HD quality. Excellent pictures and smooth transition. No ghosting effect or lag in any sort of way watching the latest video including action flicks. More details on the application itself will be in the detailed reviews below.Camera (3/5):I'm not going into any details here but don't expect a superb quality photos and videos. Cheaper phones and tablet do not come with a great lens and a sensor. But to play around with it and take general pictures, it'll do just fine. But don't try to take family portrait and expect a great photo. Won't happen!Connectivitity (5/5):This tablet seem to connect to any router very quickly open or secured. Once the credentials are entered and remembered, the tablet will connect in seconds which is refreshing. It seems to pick up more Wifi signals compared to my phone which may have to do with the size of the device. No dropped connections so far. One minor issue reconnecting but turning on/off the Wifi solved the issue quickly and hasn't happened since.Battery Life (4/5):Not bad at all. I tested and played a game for few hours and only drained to 60%. This is with battery save mode on and screen brightness at about 70%. Be sure to let the battery drain completely first and charge it in full. From about 3% to 100% charge took about 3.5 hours using the A/C wall charger that came with the device. Some people say that's slow but considering something as big as iPad 3, it's pretty fast.*** Apps ***I'll breakdown some of the apps that come with the Galaxy Tab 2.0 7" tablet and their overall impression. I feel this is where the tablet shines and even with a mediocore screen, it does give a better impression overall.YouTube:Slick little interface on this tablet with subscribed and featured videos that scroll sideways with a 3D look. Very responsive and what I personally like is that clicking on the video doesn't make it full screen automatically like the iPad. Maybe some people will prefer this but I like seeing the small screen along with any other featured videos. HD movies and clips play without a problem. Combined with an excellent audio, you can play it anywhere.Google Maps:This Wifi version has GPS. If you have the ability to tether to your phone, it's a big plus as you can run the tablet as a GPS navigation device. For some reason, the 'street view' picture quality is horrible on this device. Not sure if they did this on purpose but the only time I find that the pictures seem like it was taken with a 1-mega pixel camera. But the interface and browsing in the map is smooth and responsive.Calendar:If you use Google calendar it will notify any tasks/appointments scheduled and while giving you an excellent interface. You can add it as a widget also so that's a plus if you often use your phone to schedule meetings, etc.Gmail:Another great Google product with slick interface. Split into two screens with inbox/folders and the right pane for reading and replying.Netflix:Amazing HD quality and also connects to the server VERY fast on Wifi network. Even skipping through the videos it'll resume playing within 2-3 seconds which I found to be a great speed like playing on a regular computer. One negative here though; scrolling through the homepage of multiple video screen lags a bit with this device. Not a big deal but a minor annoyance.Browser:Default browser like many browser on Android is very basic. Some people may like it, some people may not. But of course you can run Dolphin, Opera Mini, etc all free from the Play Market. Everyone has their different taste when it comes to browsers so test them out to your liking.*** Some In-Depth Tech Review ***This is where it gets a bit nerdy but reserved for those expecting more in-depth review. As we all know, the Android vs. iOS debate as well as what this $250 tablet offers. I've used the iPad 3 for the last few months and I can honestly say this Galaxy tablet does well for it's price and in some ways if you're on a budget it also won't disappoint.Interface:By default you have this 1/2" empty screen on both sides with the stock ICS. So I ended up downloading the "Go Launcher" which I've used on my phone forever. Same as "ADW" launcher (costs money for this one) it allows you to customize the interface including icons and wallpapers. You can cram say seven columns and rows of icons on the tablet without a problem. I haven't read anything about a custom ROM but hopefully there is one out there already if not sooner. I have CM7.0 on my phone overlocked by 160MHz or so and love how much it saves on storage let alone not having all sorts of bloatware you cannot uninstall by default.Screen:The screen, I've tried adjusting the contrast with another app but as a photographer I can see some people getting very picky. Color saturation, strong black and white isn't all too impressive with this device. iPad 3 blows this tablet out of water when it comes pixel density but for its price that's a given for either tablets.Google Accounts:Yes, if you have already downloaded and purchased from another device using your Google account, all contents can be re-downloaded including paid apps. This is one thing I love about the Android system. Hopefully that will not change! Everything syncs seemlessly including Gmail, YouTube and any other associated accounts.GPS:I needed the GPS function to use with my car as I drive a lot. Running Google Maps but often times Waze to know any accidents, traffic, etc (as Google stopped doing live traffic awhile ago). I'm also a radar/laser detector enthusiast (run Escort Redline) so having another counter measure device is also a plus. Tethered to my phone, I can run Waze and Google Maps just fine and gives a better view while driving. It's really all I use it for while driving and one of the reasons why I snagged this $250 tablet. If I want to pull over and find places to eat, take my daughter to a new park, etc it's another great way to do so on this device. If you can tether to another live connection, it's a great tablet unlike spending $100+ on a Garmin (as much as I used to love Garmin). Very accurate GPS for the most part with the Wifi and GPS enabled at the same time.Battery Life:Turn on the 'battery saver' mode on. Noticed a huge difference in saving battery. Before it felt like the unit was discharging within 5-6 hours. Now I feel pretty confident it can go up to the manufacturer's claim; at leat around 9-10 hours with a light use. Charging isn't bad at all. iPad 3 takes forever to charge on the other hand BUT the thing lasts all day playing games and videos. I haven't compared the specs but assuming it has a bigger battery and ways to save energy. I haven't ran JuiceDefender on this device yet even though I've purchased the Ultimate edition awhile back. Should be just as good though.Proprietary Plug:Not sure why Samsung opted for the 16-pin connector but looks almost identical to that of iPad but it's not. Maybe because the mini-USB tends to lose connection and isn't as solid in design when plugged in? Not sure but then again aftermarket cables are cheap nowadays on Amazon or other sites so not a big deal IMO. The plug does seem to snap-in really well and is better than charging the iPad where it can be somewhat wobbly at times.There's so much more to list but if you have any question feel free to leave a comment! Overall I'm happy with the purchase. It'll make a great gift as well.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I had a 10 inch toshiba thrive tablet and not that I did not like that one but it was very heavy and cumbersome after awhile so I researched the samsung galaxy tab 2. It had some features that lacked in the toshiba thrive.. that was good but the negative that would get four stars is the charger/usb card was very very short. Samsung dropped the ball on that one! Maybe next time I will look into the 10 inch for a larger screen- games etc...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|In 20 words or more! Bought this for my wife so that she can use her fingers to reach her friends with her 7 inch tab!

I highly recommend this tablet. Excellent product for the price.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I really like my tablet and use it everyday. I'm used to to the Android system so it was easy for me to figure out the settings and everything. The only thing I still struggle with is the keyboard that pops up. It isn't a problem with the tablet, it is just something I still need to get used to. Other than that, I love my tablet and would recommend to others.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The only thing is how do I put all my games on to my memory chip I need help with that but over all this tablet I would give one to my family if I had the money I love it no problem at all and I had a Acer tablet and it suck but this is the best thing yall every come out with

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this 3/18/2013 and received it 3/22/2013. I played with it all weekend long. I t was easy to setup and operate. it sync all of my accounts so I have all my pictures and email contacts. I have mine in a case and it works fine no matter what hand I hold it in. it's fast enough and the right size for me and my 8 year old daughter. I love it. I will write another review after I've had it longer.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was looking to get a new tablet since my acer 7 inch died. i had been looking around and looked at many... so then i saw the samsung galaxy tab 2 and was skeptical about getting it. when it cam i was suprised by how thin and slim it was... also i must say i am pleased with how it operates and the easy use of the product.. i would recommend it and wish i would have gotten the galaxy in the beginning. ....love it so much
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Read reviews and read reviews, finally decided on the tab2. This worked great right out of the box for me. Now i have a samsung galaxy s3 so i kinda knew what i was in for as for as android stuff. I bought the case to go with it with the blue tooth keyboard. It is the one that is nos a soft key keyboard and i really like that too. I am typing on it now. I wish this tablet charged with a mini usb charger instead of samsung cord. I agree with others to buy an additional cord to have on hand. So far good battery life and no freeze ups.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I ordered 2 of these and the guys I got them for in our office just love them. Very user friendly and perfect for the amount of money we spent on them. They are worth any penny. They are great to have for traveling sales presentations. I have no problems/complaints at this time!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I spent a week debating between the kindle fire and this samsung tablet. In the end I decided to purchase the tablet. I thought the price of $179 was amazing for a tablet. So far I have not been supported at all with this tablet functions. It was very easy to start up and download applications immediately. This tablet is JUST like my phone the samsung s3 without phone capabilities. The internet works amazing and all of my application functions. I am extremely happy that the kindle app is available for android systems. This is the main reason that I was searching for a tablet. I am not disappointed with this tablet at all and the same is just perfect for my needs. It is worth the money if you are looking or an affordable tablet. I never leave the house without it! Oh and the battery power is amazing also on this tablet. I did not have to charge it once on a two day weekend trip.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|after living with the palm for 10 plus years this is a great device. It is nice that so far every where I go I manage to find some wifi to use it online. With my palm I kept documents and was able to convert all to the tablet and I can use it online or off. I love it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet ROCKS! It completely lived up to my expectations and the price was so reasonable that Hubby and I both got one. Samsung is awesome!

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love android products.. this is small, simple, light weight, easy to use.. I bought it for my mom and I think she will be very happy on how simple it is.. The camera (both front and back) are good too.. very good value for money, compared to an ipad mini..
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this as a reader, and use it to read and watch movies on. The video quality is good, not great, but at the price point you can expect that when the higher quality screens are 300-500$$. neat that it can be used as a smart remote, and that set up was easy. would definitely buy another samsung tablet in the future.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|this tablet is really good, really fast, runs everything that a through at it (games, apps, ect), I have it with a 32gb card and Bluetooth keyboard, so far my laptop is collecting dust, really bright screen, great camera, amazing touch sensor, A++ product

tablet_galaxy_tab|I love it. its every thing i expected. the features are great and the description about it is all true. money well spent
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really like the android setup on the galaxy tab. Ive used three other tabs and the galaxy tab far surpasses the other three... it cost more to but definitely worth it! There's only two issues ive had wit it... ive had problems with not having adobe flash... and i wish it had a little more memory ... however weve had both of these issues with my son's kindle fire... so it must just be a tab thing!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this refurbished and you couldn't even tell! It works excellently and I love it. This was also my first time using the android operating system and I was delighted to find it has so many features and is so easy to use. Absolutely nothing bad to report about this. If you are considering it, get it!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My first tablet and I love it. I wound up getting the samsung galaxy phone and the two are almost identical in usage. Very intuitive, nice screen, etc.. I like the smaller size.

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I enjoy my tablet. I bought another one for a gift too. Maybe the next one I buy you could give me a little discount, that would be nice. Thanks again Donna
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|So far so good. No complaints. The video is fine but a bit dark, same with the camera. The sound is excellent.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tablet so this review may be better than others because i am new to the whole tablet lifestyle. So far i have no problem with the tablet, everything is working great and i am happy about that. Since i am new to the tablet world i had a hard time picking between this and the kindle fire hd, which i am so happy i didnot pick. the samsung galaxy tab 2 have a great variety of apps to download both from the play store and the samsung store(kindle reader is already installed on it, so if you have a kindle account, just log-in to amazon and wa-laa). the tablet have most of everyday usable apps already install on it, so to be honest unless you are into apps and many games, you wont really need to download too much. I also brought a case and screen protector for this tablet before i actually used it to avoid too many prints. Overall i really love my tablet and i enjoy using it to read, to watch netflix, to play games and also just to listen to music. Couldnt ask for a better tablet at such a low price. i would definately buy this product as a gift or for myself again.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Loved the first one so much that I bought another, going to use it to Skype with my wife while away on business. Amazon shipped it really fast.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've had my Galaxy Tab 2 (7&#34;) for about 5 days and have thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a perfect size for reading. Easy to hold with one hand. I don't feel like I'm giving up much with a smaller screen. I bought a moko slim fit case and 32gb card to go with it and they were both good purchases.What I wish I had known:-the external SD card can only store music/video files, not Apps. So you will still be limited on app space on an 8 gig tablet (really only 4 gigs after android system). Still, I have all my apps on it with plenty of room (about 3 gigs still remaining)-the device charger won't well through other USB outlets. I don't know if it's proprietary or a voltage issue. It will charge while plugged into a comp USB port if the tablet is asleep, but not while being used.-the cameras (front & back) aren't spectacular, but are acceptable for the low cost of the tablet.-Amazon doesn't currently have an app to watch instant video on Android devices (you'd have to get Kindle Fire for that)

tablet_galaxy_tab|My sister got one and I fell in love..finally got one too and cannot get enough..works great recommend this buy!!!

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is an excellent tablet. It's cheap. For its price you can't ask for more. It has back camera (unlike my Nexus 7) and bay for memory card. The screen is responsive.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My husband is very happy with his new tablet. The size is right, as the larger ones are a bit too large for his use in the shop. Capabilities exceeded his expectation.The only downside to these tablets is they don't like to take baths, something mine accidentally did shortly after his arrived.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|excellent product, to my opinion no need to improve on anything, I'm comfortable with the product, it is good to have a good service
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this in order to give my wife's iPhone a little rest from being used so much to play games. After playing games on the iPhones small screen for so long it was wonderful to see them on the bigger screen. Makes angry birds a much better game.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|We bought our sons fiance a Kindle, then I took a programming class and needed an Android tablet so we bought this one. This so out performs her Kindle. Sorry Amazon, love you but have to be honest. The frame rate is way better on this one and I like that it seems more computer-esk than the Kindle. I was one of those people who said &#34;I have no use for a tablet, its just a toy&#34; well, gotta admit, I really like it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My wife loves her tablet. It was affordable and easy to use.she plays music and watches videos on it often.battery life is about 3 hours with the screen turned on almost all the way
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tab so I cant com pair it to anything but its great.I The best thing is I can put my own files on it.my Brother got him self an Ipad and took it back because he was not able to do that with ease.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|We have the Samsung Tab 2 10.1-inch and this 7-inch one is just as perfect as the other. The only thing I like more about the 7-inch Tab is that it's easier to carry around and fits perfect in my purse for easy transport. If you purchase this you wont be sorry, it's amazing!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love the portability, the size, the picture. Has a long battery enough charge for me (I charge every night). Looks sharp, is fast, easy to learn how to use. I don't leave home without it!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Not a whole lot to say other than Perfect for those looking for a 7&#34; tablet. I highly recommend getting a cover/case for it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My kids had enjoy the purchase that I end up buying three of them. Very great experience came on Time No regrets!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|el producto me lleg&oacute; a tiempo, en buen estado, estoy satisfecho con la compra lo recomiendo 100% no tengo quejas,Muchas gracias por el servicio.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have an iphone and wanted to venture out to google phones. Instead of buying an unlocked phone, I decided to spend my $250 on a tablet. This is my first tablet. Well worth it. I found the size of the tablet to be convenient, and it makes it easier to hold for long periods of time. The tablet has all your basic apps installed.Very user friendly, easy to use and good battery life. I did end up returning my tablet because the internet browser keeps on closing by itself. As usual, AMAZON customer service people were very helpful and sent me a replacement.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this tablet to free myself from my home PC. It does exactly as advertized and I just love. I can read e mails download all the e books i want, get the news etc. the battery is great and last almost all day. I would highly recommend this product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|definitely performing at the top of the pyramid. nothing comes close. loving it. only glitch is the inability to move apps to the microsd card. this is unfortunate. sucks. samsung needs to fix that pronto with a firmware upgrade.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this tablet. It runs smooth and quick. The ease of setting it up has made me play with it all day long. It says it has 8gig harddrive but you only have about 4 gigs to use. I purchased a 32 gig sdhc along with it and it recognized it as soon as it was installed. Already have a movie and pdf on that card and they play without any problems.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is so easy to use! Has long battery life, and the touchscreen is very reactive. I love using the calendar, and have ditched my "paper" planner altogether. The camera is nice to have on hand, too. The TV remote app was simple to set up and use. I use this tablet every day, and haven't had any issues. It connects to wi-fi networks quickly and effortlessly. I'm obviously not tech savvy, but for a beginner who needs something functional and super easy to use, this is a fantastic product.

tablet_galaxy_tab|After about 3 weeks owning this, I can say I am quite pleased. What I wanted was an e reader with extra organizer/calendar capabilities. What I got is far more. After the annoying setup and constant asking for account logins to connect, it performs well past expectations. Admittedly this is my first tablet type product. I was not expecting full GPS capabilities and the sheer number of apps available to do anything I can imagine. Now I just have to figure out how to keep it away from the kids. Also I have not managed to kill the battery in a day's use....yet. The menus can be annoying to go through sometimes, and the "touch" seems to be off by about 1/8 inch. It can be hard to hit a small button or link on the internet sometimes. There probably is a way to adjust that, but I have not found it yet. Also the manual is useless. There needs to be a full manual online or on the device, with "idiot" instructions for those of us that are new to this type product.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I really like this tablet. It's has great picture quality. I can read my kindle books. I can watch movies and play games. It definitely serves it's purpose. It's not too small but definitely not too big either. It can fit into any bag. I like using it and definitely recommend it. I think it's better than spending $500 or more bucks for an Ipad. No offense to amazon, but I think it's definitely better than the Kindle Fire and the Nook Tablet. If you're looking to get the Kindle Fire or Nook Tablet, you'll be better off buy this baby right here.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a solid product and anyone who doesn't like it is either deluded or has fallen for the iPad dogma. I had bought my wife a kindle fire for Christmas since she is an avid reader and needed some entertainment for when I go riding in the desert. I played with hers a little and almost immediately had tablet envy. Since I am pretty tech savy I wanted to do some research before also buying a Kindle fire to make sure it was the right choice for me. Well the research pointed out the weaknesses in the fire (Bad browser, truncated and outdated droid system, and no expandable memory) so after further research I settled on the Tab 2 which had just come out. This felt like a bit of a chance since it was brand new and there were not a lot of consumer reviews available, but the previous versions had good reviews so I went for it. I am super glad I did! It is a pleasure to use and although at first it seemed very similar to my Droidx phone, it is actually much more powerful and versatile.They expanded memory is a big plus and makes carrying content a non issue since you can bring as many cards along as you would like.The IR port included is also nice and the software for it was easy to use. I had mis-placed my bedroom TV remote and was able to set it up on the tablet in mere moments. Of course since it was a Samsung TV probably helped.All in all I would definitely make this purchase again!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I've wanted a Kindle Fire since they came out but really wanted expandable memory and would have liked the rear facing camera to use Skype. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7" does everything the Kindle Fire does PLUS I can use at 32 GB micro SD card AND it has dual cameras for ONLY $50 more. I don't have a smart phone so this little tablet gives me all of that on a bigger screen as long as I have Wi-Fi. The camera quality is decent and looks great onscreen. If I want "memorable" photo or video, I'll use my real camera but it's great for on the go. If you've never used a smart phone or tablet, it takes a little time to figure out how to set up the home page and apps. The touch keyboard is sensitive but I'm getting better at that. I've only had it a few days but I've already set up gmail, imported contacts, calendars, photos and music. My kids have downloaded several apps. With the Kindle app, it acts just like the Fire but you still can download other types of digital books. Loving it so far!

tablet_galaxy_tab|Very impressed with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. Going in, did not want top-of-the-line, and did not want to be tethered to any one content provider. Moreover, I've got way too many philosophical problems with Apple, which IMO, does not offer value pricing to the average person. Instead, I sought out a nice balance between capability, features, and cost -- and found it with this Samsung tablet! The whole family has logged time on this reliable little monster, and we're all impressed. Good job with the product, and of course, with the outstanding Amazon service.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got my tablet about a year ago and I absolutely love it. There isn't anything I cannot do on it and I have all kinds of games, plus it keeps track of my emails and I can go look up my facebook page and do internet shopping. Like i said, there isn't anything this tablet cannot do. I love it!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is really great! Especially for the price. I won't go into detail (other reviews will tell you more) but I will say that it does everything I wanted-and more. A great product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|For being a Samsung galaxy I'm already disappointed. For example, the auto-text seems to have a mind of its own, often i have to place a period to move on, and the wireless is weak
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I would recommend this product, it's easy to use, it's reliable and worth the price. I give it two thumbs up.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Compre la tabla con la idea de usarla para lectura, ahora que la tengo hago de todo con ella, ya no necesito encender el ordenador. De veras es un art&iacute;culo ful vers&aacute;til
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Works very well. So, so, so convenient in size, could fit into my purse easily. Thanks Samsung. This is a wonderful product which does everything as reviewed.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I received my Table and I really love it. it is complete, it has a very goof screen and image
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love my tablet, it was so easy to setup, works just like my smart phone, love everything about it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I received this remote as a package deal with a Samsung Plasma I also bought on Amazon. The tablet is a sturdy build. If you've seen or owned another recent Samsung phone or tablet you'll feel at home on this device. Its not as plasticy as the newer Samsung phones. The screen has a slim bezel but not so slim there's nothing to hold onto. The screen does attract fingerprints on the black bezel but there's a white model floating around if that really bothers you. It runs a recent version of Android 4.1.x which gives it the performance updates of &#34;Jellybean&#34; Android. This model is also the GT-P3113 version. This model has the integrated IR repeater in the side of the unit. It also comes preloaded with remote control software. Its a neat idea and as a remote its much more useful than what $200 bucks will normally buy you in the custom remote scene.I did purchase the 8GB model. It only has about half of that usable after the OS is loaded. The advantage of the Samsung over other models (Asus Nexus 7) is it will allow for a 32gb micro SD card to be plugged in the side. You can store all sorts of movies on 32gb and then swap them out as much as possible.The screen isn't &#34;retina display&#34; crisp, but it also doesn't cost what an iPad costs and the iPad Mini doesn't have retina display anyways. I only mention that because inevitably someone will look to compare the two. If you're already bought into the Android ecosystem with an Android phone this a great addition. If you have a Samsung TV or really any TV that has published IR codes you can impress your friends a family with your new cool Samsung Tablet remote control. If you want a versatile e-reader with the huge Android ecosystem back-end, this device makes much more sense than a Kindle Fire HD or Nook HD.Its a great device and at $200 or less it's a steal.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I became a fan of Samsung. This tablet is better than many others. If you need a compact tablet, buy this one. Good luck to everyone!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great device really love it. Wantes an ipad but this is great for the price even though the price was reduced after I bought it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My wife and i bought this for our 9 year old son for his 9th birthdat back in Febuary and he has not put it down since the minute he opened it. This replaced his kindle fire which he drop and cracked the screen and the price to get the screen fixed was the same price for the galaxy tab 2. he likes it much better than the kindle. This is a great gift and works just as well as and as fast as a computer or laptop. I love samsung products
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Well, for one, my wife and I both have one. If you have a phone to where you can use you phone as a hotspot, then this product is great. I'm hardly at my house, so I hotspot my phone and use the tablet. It is great...not too big and not too small. Does everything that I hope it would do and more. I do wish that there was a flash for the camera on the back. I haven't had any problems with it and don't expect that I will.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Wife love's it and keeps it in her purse when going here and there. With the cover on it she can actually find it easily in her purse and use it. Could see buying one for myself if it were a WIndows Tab.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Has everything as more expensive pads have. Compact and easy to take everywhere. Kids will love it. enjoy your pad.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this product! I'm so glad I purchased it. I love browising my email accounts and the apps I've downloaded and used. All the things I love about my laptop without the bulkiness and the weight!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|im enjoying my tablet,i love it,its convience,it respond fast,i havent had any problems with it besides that i love it to DEATH.....

tablet_galaxy_tab|because i never use it anymore, my kick- butt, ninja- like laptop never gets any love anymore.....I love this tab
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bougth this tablet for my mom. It was a great purchase, easy to use!Pros: Easy to use, memory upgrade with microsd card, nice screen.Cons: battery life is awful, front camera.For a basic use of a tablet (tiwitter, internet, skype) it is a great option.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was skeptical after reading reviews but bought the Galaxy because of the OS and open nature of the product. I owned around 400 ebooks in four different formats so wanted one device to read them all. I wanted to be able to do email and a little web browsing. Also wanted some of the same apps as my Droid. I was not disappointed with the device. It has been great tablet. Battery life meets my needs. I have Kindle, Nook and Mantano loaded with all my books. I live block from the beach and can read the screen with no problems. The tablet has been very stable with only two minor app glitches that were quickly fixed. It recently upgraded to newest OS and happy with the improvements. I would definitely buy another.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|We have two of these now and they work very well. The Android OS is really easy to navigate and syncing up with Gmail and Google calendars is seamless. They are small and light and with a bluetooth keyboard allowed me to stop lugging a laptop around with me to work. My 8y/o loves his also. We bought an Otter Box case for his and it's VERY durable. Tons of free games and apps keep him busy on long drives so mom likes it as well!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love every thing about it. runs smooth very responsive the perfect size . runs on Android 4.1.1 Jelly bean i did a lot of shopping around before i came to a decisions best bang for the buck.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I first bought a cheap computer , the cheap computer had issues off it went back to amazon.I then started to search for a tablet.After doing my on line search and asking friends, this tablet was the one to try and I bought It .I am very happy with the clear screen , the sound is good, I can watch netflix and so on.Yes its a great tablet.I do suggest giving this tablet a go.Its not letting me down.I loaded google crome and to me its very much like a little computer.enjoy!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|me encanto la tabla cuando la vi .espero tenerla pronto en mis manos es lo que estaba buscando es efectiva para mi tipo de trabajo
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The tablet is pretty small if they could make this product bigger that would be nice. I like the fact that you can use amicro sd removable storage this makes my life much easier. I can also carry this device in my back pocket.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love my galaxy tablet its fast, fits in my pocket book with ease. It is loaded with a lot of awesome app. I would highly recommend it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great tablet for the price. Quite handy, fast and generous in space and settings. I do really recommend this one if you want a portable device to read your emails, keep on track about the news, get your docs instantly, check your bank accounts, listen to the music and other personal things.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very good product.Starting with the box and finishing with the samsung apps, thie tablet is awesome.Very fast and lightweight.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Only problem with this tab is it does not support a flash player. Otherwise the tablet works great and connect to wi-fi easily.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was told this was the &#34;best gift&#34; I could have gotten him, he was very surprised and very happy!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I recently purchased Galaxy Tab 2 from Amazon and I bought an extra 32 GB micro-SD and a protective case. It is a great device which I use almost daily for the past 2 weeks or so. I have owned several Android phones and I like a lot of the Apps that I can get for free or for low price. Once I configured my tablet, entering my Gmail address, all my apps were downloaded and installed on the new device. Somehow, I got my contacts from my phone there too. I guess I saved them to my Google account. The screen is bigger than my HTC Amaze, which has a good size screen for a phone. The battery life is a lot better than my phone's battery. It lacks data connection, but it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so I use my phone's hot spot to get internet to the Tab when I am away from my Wi-Fi. When I am sitting in my car, I use Bluetooth to connect to my sound system (CR-V). The camera lacks zoom, but I found an application on Play Store (Camera ICS) which gives it zoom capability. I don't think you can save apps on the micro-SD card, but you can save pictures and multimedia files on it.Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi)

tablet_galaxy_tab|I want to give 3.5 stars.[Good]- I dont need my labtop anymore- Wifi works totally fine- easy to use- many good options(I dont actually need all of thme bczu I only use this for PDF and internet things)- GPS, so you can track yours when stolen or lost- Enough space for all my e-book and music... and you can get more space by purchasing the $14~20 flash memory card- I want to strongly recommand people to buy galaxy-tab2-bluetooth-keyboard which makes this product even cooler[Bad]-Battery doesnt stay that long.If you want to use this for a long time that samsung mentioned "Music Playback (Up to 77 Hours), Video Playback(Up to 6 Hours", you have to turn off all the options such as wifi, bluetooth, sound, light(minimum), and GPS.-Also, the screen sometimes stops or move slow for a while (like 0.2~0.5 seconds but it's annoying)I havn't used other tablet so I can't really compare with, but I wouldn't surely recommand my friend to buy this.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7in) is great product. I am not much of a computer person but the Galaxy was easy to learn and the Samsung Help Line got me up and going. I purchased the Tablet to watch Brighthouse TV at home while my husband watches his shows on the full TV. Size is perfect and works great on the Blue Tooth settings which I did not realize it had for 2 weeks. If I can operate this Tablet anyone can. Amnazon was super helpful with getting the product to me ASAP.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Overall this is a wonderful tablet. I got the 8GB student edition (with the keyboard) for $249.99 at Best Buy. I went with this model over the Nexus 7 for two reasons, 1. camera, 2. expandable memory. I figured that a good 32GB micro SD card will only cost me around $25 to I could have 40GB on my tablet and still but under the $300 mark.The only complaint, and it's a big one for me, is you CANNOT move applications to the SD Card. This has to be something Samsung has done by design because moving applications is native to the Android OS. I even tried loading the Android SDK and forcing applications to load on external storage, no go. My only option here would be to root the device which I do not want to do.Samsung, if you are reading these reviews, please, please fix this in an update. The expandable memory is one of the reasons I bought this tablet over the Nexus 7. Once this news gets out, you may lose business to the Nexus 7. I do not wish to root my device but if space becomes and issue, I will.Again, wonderful tablet, just remove this ridiculous restriction that is native to the OS.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I recently bought this tablet a few days back. I play it everyday almostly. It is very light and screen is very pretty. The quality is good also. but when I try to use it to write something, it is not very sensitive, which is very bad because I want to use as a notebook for meeting or paper. Anyway, if you like to browse the web, listen music and play game. It is very good for you.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I admit, when it comes to tablets/phones I am 100% Apple. While I'm not a fan of their computers, I really think they do a great job with the iPad and iPhone. That being said, I have always been very curious about Android and "the other side". I share my iPad with my wife, but apparently I hog it as she mentioned to me a few months back that she wanted one as well. I took that as an opportunity, to her chagrin, to try out an Android tablet. I looked around and found this Galaxy Tab.I have been pleasantly surprised with what this little gadget can do. It takes a some getting used to, but it does everything the iPad does and a little bit more. I like the widgets and the way you can customize each of your pages. You really can't do that on an iPad - I always feel that Apple thinks they know better than their customer so why would you have to customize?The screen is very clear and the size is nice too as my wife can just slip it into her purse. Another drawback of the iPad. It is fast as well, all the apps and programs I have tried are very quick and easy to use. I also just upgraded it to 32GB for $19, that's at least a $100 perk for an iPad. The infrared remote control is a cool option as well.A drawback I have found so far is that the WiFi is a little weak - I get a very strong signal sitting downstairs with my iPad but a very very weak signal with this Tab. I've since moved my router which has helped considerably. Another huge drawback is the obvious lack of apps. There really is no comparison with Apple in this regard.Overall, I think this is a great product, I'm glad we bought it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was looking for an Apple alternative tablet. For me, the iPad is too big for what I need. I was initially looking at the other 7" tablets, but they did not have the features that the Tab 2 7" has.Pros:7" is perfect for watching video, email, web browsing, e-reading and general consumptionBattery life is excellent - was able to watch two 2-hour movies streaming from Netflix and still had ~40% battery life left. With light to moderate use, can go 1+ days without charging.Has a GPS receiver built in (so it can be used as GPS, but still needs WiFi or hotspot to download maps).Micro SD up to 32gb HUGE plusFront and rear camerasCPU speed is goodIR Blaster and the Peel App - I LOVE this... It's completely changed how I watch TV and find shows!! It controls my Cable box, Stereo and TV (plus can add DVD/BR player as well).Cons:Lock button is easy to press when using w/o a case or standCamera resolution is too low to replace a real cameraWill not charge over USB from PC (neither will the iPad), and it's tough to find an A/C block that will charge itOther Notes:I'm still not sure about the Samsung apps. I may end up rooting it and going with another version of 4.x, but I haven't researched the pros and cons of this yet on the Samsung Tabs.. I'm wondering is there is any functionality loss (like the IR blaster, etc.).If you are looking for an alternative to the iPad or something more functional than the other 7" tablets out there, I recommend this one. While it's not perfect, it's "bang for the buck" factor is HIGH!!!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I currently own a 1st gen IPAD (64gb WIFI & 3G nonactivated and purchased on sale through AT&T when IPAD 2 came out) and only use it during traveling. It's function for me falls between an expensive toy, e-reader, and movie player. I wanted to Skype and a lighter tablet so I hesitantly purchased the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.0 7 inch at Costco for $239. I cannot say how this tablet compares to newer generations of IPAD but compared with my 1st gen, it offers more versatility and of course it is the compact solution for traveling and doesn't add as much weight as the IPAD. So now I can carry it in my purse everywhere I go with no bulk added! Now I have Kindle keyboard so as far as reading goes, I prefer using the tablet for reading PDF files and have yet to try comic books which Kindle keyboard is not compatible with. However, for regular e-books I still prefer my Kindle keyboard because of the battery life and the E ink technology that is much easier on my eyes. The Samsung's touchscreen is slightly less responsive than the IPAD but after using it for a few days I've figured out that you can tweek the responsiveness on the settings. As far as application use, you can open and manage multiple apps and widgets simultaneously which at first being a nuisance to an apple groupie like me, I am slowing adapting to use the tablet for efficient tasking. For instance, I usually need to scan tons of receipts so I downloaded a scan app like Genius scan then scan my documents and save to evernote. I can open the calculator without closing the evernote app and calculate different receipts. This is a huge time saver over the IPAD and Iphone which only allows one app to be opened at one time. My favorite widget so far is the sticky notes which can be posted in different sizes on the home screen (something IPAD can't do). However, to prevent the multiple apps from slowing down the Galaxy, it's important to check the task manager and close apps that are running in the background. As for internet connection, I haven't had any problems like other reviewers have posted. Also, the microSD slot is a huge bonus over the IPAD which allows for expanded memory for photos and music, etc. A 32 GB micrsoSD card on Amazon is around $19 so a huge money saver over any of the IPADs. I am planning to purchase the Samsung accessory kit for USB and SD slot for greater expansion in the future (that's around $20 on amazon). A couple things I didn't like are the poor camera resolution and the smudging and glare of the screen. The IR remote app is a great concept that worked on my TV but has very limited functions. It doesn't allow for searching by channels and doesn't provide a tv guide. When I entered into the menu of the tv, the keypad doesn't work for scrolling or exiting the menu. Overall, I am making great use of the expanded capabilities. There is so much customization that I have spent hours exploring.Update Sept. 2I had buyer's remorse a few days after my samsung purchase but after I sold my IPAD, my relationship with my Samsung has blossomed. I've downloaded the DoubleTwist sync app for $4.99 and have synced all my media from Itunes onto my tablet as well as my PS3. The bluetooth is a bonus as I've also synced a Kivia bluetooth speaAer. I then transferred all my media to the 32GB microSD card that I also purchased on Amazon for $19. People asked me where I purchased my case. I couldn't find it on amazon so I purchased off of ebay, search for "smart flip case cover samsung tab 7.0". The case looks like the colored flip cases that are sold from Apple for the Ipad. I loved this tab so much that I also purchased the white student edition bundle yesterday for $249, $10 more than I paid for the silver tablet alone a few weeks ago. The bundle comes with a keyboard and usb adapter.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Others have written much about the comparative technical capabilities of this device so let me just say how it suits my needs.When I travel I need to keep up with my email and browse the internet from time to time; store lots of info about my transport and destinations; consult and expand detailed maps and sort out routes etc. For example I will read the synopsis of a German opera in English during a performance in Berlin and I will find the best way to get to Versailles from Paris or drive from Seattle to Boise Idaho. I suppose I could do all this with a smart phone but really the screen is so small and inconvenient. I could carry a notebook but that is such a drag!So I bought this 7 inch tablet and it suits me just fine, especially as the price ($250) is so reasonable. I can download Google maps for offline use and there are numerous travel apps such as an excellent guide to the Paris Metro. For E-books I persist with my Kindle because of the link with Amazon and the excellent quality of the print.I am quite computer literate and have been surprised that at home I often prefer this tablet to my notebook and PC. Sure - it would be nice to have 3G but WiFi is adequate for my needs. There has been criticism of the number of pixels but I am quite content with the DVD+ quality of the Samsung Tab 2 7.0.Oops! I forgot! The "Fisher Price" camera is even worse than most mobile phone cameras. Instead, I prefer to use a real camera and with an "EyeFi" SD card in the camera the pics are automatically downloaded to the tablet where they can be culled. edited, re-sized and published directly to a website.I also use "Dropbox" for transferring files from my PC to the Tablet etc.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Have had the tablet for about a month now and no problems what so ever, works great easy to carry fits in a suit pocket (without a case) I use it so much my laptop feels neglected! would recommend to anyone. Handles every video format I threw at it, mkz, avi, mpv et., Handles PDF, epub, word for windows, no problems, seems as fast as my i3 laptop, I use it a lot and use my other computers much less

tablet_galaxy_tab|As the owner of 2 Ipads I was reluctant to buy this, but i have heard such good things about this tablet, that I had to see for myself. And I must admit that it is pretty close in quality. And the size is surprising comfortable to hold.Faast shipping too.

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I know of many other products with the same features, but pueod say this tablet is fantastic.I bought it because of its compact design, regular size and excellent recommendations from other friends who are the same.I really like their resolution, responsiveness. I do not like that is very selective with finding wifi networks, ie, when no old router intercepts.I recommend it 100%
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Adicto a la tecnologia, en esta ocasion me encontre con un producto que va acorde con lo esperado. lastima que el estuche adicional no era el esperado.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|to be the most basic of samsung tablet is more than what I expected. has high definition picture quality, is fast and good battery runtime.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I received this as an anniversary gift and what a wonderful gift! Not having a smart phone it took a little bit getting used to the touch screen, but being able to expand it and just using it made it a breeze to operate. I have only had it about a month and have already read about a book a day or more. It would have been nice to have a few more instructions with it as I still haven't figured out some of the applications...........but I will! Bought the memory card as well just in case I run out of room. Would recommend this to anyone!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Its the 1st tablet I have purchased/owned & still learning how to use it! BUT,my 8 yr. old granddaughter could use it right away with no problem while I am still reading the instructions. The video camera is great. She takes martial arts & have a 16 yr. hockey player that I have used video for their events & downloaded to facebook. Have downloaded games - used internet etc with no problems! Its small enough to fit in my purse & take anywhere. Only problem it is slow opening up & battery does not last as long as I would like. Hockey games & martial arts events are long. Bev
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|So far this tablet is amazing, no crashing and everything works so well! large screen but still compact. All in all i love it!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my 1st tablet and 1st Android experience. I like the Android apps and my wife loves being able to check email and facebook on the tablet. (Got it for her for Mother's day) I know it will take a while to get familiar with the OS, so in general I am very impressed with our early experience with it.Here's my favorite use for this device...I need to replace my GPS Chartplotter on my boat. Garmin gets more than $700 for a Marine Chartplotter with a display the size of the GT2. And the GT2 does so much more ! I downloaded a free app for NOAA charts and took it out on the boat - its fantastic !Have longed to move beyond the one annoyance with my iphone, of having to go through iTunes to manage files. Connected to the PC, the GT2 works like a flash drive. The file manager in the tablet will take some getting used to.A few glitches noted so far...The smooth scrolling through desktop menu screens can get rather choppy at times as though the processor is overloaded. Then later it is back running smoothly. The basic clock/alarm that comes pre-installed doesn't shut-off when we press the "button" on the screen as it incessantly alarms in the morning. We have to repeatedly press all the buttons and finally it shuts up. Not a good way to start the day...Over all, for the price, very happy with this device ! !

tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this Tablet. I've used several over the past few years trying to find a way around using the Apple brand. For those of you saying it has bad wireless reception, perhaps you should try changing the channel on your modem? I can stream netflix or any other media anywhere in my home, which is 2700 sq feet and my bedroom is across the house from my modem. Sometimes wireless issues aren't issues with the device. Just a thought, and I am in technical support and personally deal with wireless issues for my customers constantly. I can even sit OUTSIDE the local library and stream netflix from their wireless modem in my car while waiting for my kids' program to end. THAT is a good wireless device.

tablet_galaxy_tab|...but, it doesn't solve world hunger.What I was looking for was an inexpensive tablet that I could use for recreation. Mostly to read books, do some web browsing, check email, look at an occasional video, play some music and run some of those nice android apps I have on my phone (Motorola Atrix). It does all of that very nicely, with decent battery life.Compared to our Ipad 2, it doesn't have that silky smooth user experience - although it's close, but the trade off is that you get the widgets and flexibility of Android.The things it doesn't do well are generally no fault of Samsung. - I can't watch MLB TV on it - app does not support the device. - There is no RSA SecurID soft token app that works for android w/o cell data. - The Google music app does not support album art for wma music. - The Xfinity app that works well with the Comcast HD box on my phone and the iPad, does not work well with the Galaxy - no access to "setup" - Comcast app issue. - The Peel software that controls the IR blaster to use it as a TV remote is more gimmick than useful - at least for my Comcast HD box connect to my LG TV. It's much, much simpler to just grab a the regular Xfinity TV remote.There is one annoyances that is Samsung's fault is the auto-brightness is flaky. Sometimes it gets stuck on "very dim". I generally turn that feature off when I'm reading a book.Put a Transcend 32Gig class 10 micro SD card in it. Works great. Bought a Roocase for it. Also works great.All in all, this is a really nice tablet, especially for $250! If you are Android savvy, then this may be the table for you.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I just got my Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 today around 5 p.m. and ever since i got it i cannot put it down. I work at the crack of dawn and its about 2 o'clock in the morning and im still playing with it. The batery life is awesome and the screen display is insane. I sell phones for a living and i ALWAYS talk up the android phones because the operating systems are never a disappointment. Samsung is a very well known brand and the quality is worth the money. Way better than the ipads because of the expandable memory and lower prices. I love my new andriod tablet and my android phone. Seriously not a disappointment. I got mine in white too so there isnt only black! This also isnt my first tablet. Ive had the ipad before and it just didnt impress me. They come out with new ones and they all seem the same to me. Too much pain in my pocket for adding siri and a new "faster" chip (by seconds; maybe.) I bought this beauty for $199 and it does everything i would want it to. The only disappointment, its not the new jellybean opperating system, but the difference isnt much. Just the newest on the market ;) im sure there is a way to update it to it for you techies. Accept my challenge. I dare you. Take that back i triple dog dare you. ANYWAYS! Get yours today for this fabulous price! Enjoy! Hope this was helpful! #teamANDROID Samsung is the way to go!

tablet_galaxy_tab|This product is nice in overallPros :- price- features- expandable memory- slim , fits in handCons :- you cannot install software in memory card, but 5 GB memory can be enough, atleast for average user- i felt difficulty in typing.- speakers are on the shorter side of tab, so while watching movies, stereo effect wont work ......

tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is the first Android device I have ever owned. I wouldn't say that I'm vehemently Apple-oriented, because my phone is still a Blackberry, but I am rather attached to my iPod touch. I was pretty sure nothing could replace it. I've owned both an iPad and a Kindle Fire, and as loyal as I am to Amazon, I gave my Kindle Fire to my son. I really didn't like the user interface of the Fire, or not being able to run HBOGo, and I hated not being able to run Flash on my iPad.So, I went shopping around. When the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 came up for sale, a colleague and I went in halves for one. We both wanted to try it, and decided that this would be the best way. When it came, I had a bit of a ride on the learning curve, but after that, I found that I loved the platform. Using, downloading, and installing apps/widgets is easy, uninstalling is also easy - the process is not difficult to find. Email was a breeze to set up, and I now have shortcuts for 3 different email accounts. Facebook and Twitter work flawlessly, and all the apps I bought when I had a Kindle Fire are available to me here.I was a bit concerned about my iTunes music. I have a lot of classical music, and I wanted it available to me. Google Play made that incredibly easy. I still use my Amazon Cloud Player, which works great, and I downloaded and installed Dropbox so I can now share files much more easily between devices than I could before.I know that some people are descrying the fact that you can't save apps to the SD card. Not an issue for me, as I am not a terribly heavy app user. I have my favorite few, and that works for me. I will probably get an SD card for pictures and music, so I don't think I will have to worry about device space being an issue.The 7 inch size is perfect. I hated the iPad - it was too big, but the Galaxy Tab's size is great. Battery life has also been good.I'm really pleased with my purchase, and my Tab 2 has replaced my iPod touch. For everything. Thanks, Samsung (and Amazon!)EDITED 1/11/13I'm deducting one star from this review for the flimsiness and the length of the charging cord. It's simply not sturdy enough - the wires are showing where the cord connects to the Tab, and because the cord is so short, it's difficult not to put pressure on the charger if you aren't sitting next to an outlet when you want to use it. I realize that an extension cord would solve the problem, but I think that should be Samsung's job, not mine. The charger does actually still work, so I am not taking more stars, but I will definitely have to look in to getting a replacement soon.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Overall I am pleased with this tablet and the MANY apps that are available.HOWEVER, this tablet will NOT take STILL PHOTOS outside using the built in app.The outside photos just appear as a BLANK Grey Square.It WILL take video both inside and outside, and stills inside????I went to several online boards and this seems to be an ongoing problem with NO real solution.Also, it appears that it doesn't happen to ALL tablets all the time?I have been able to take stills outside with some of the other available camera apps for this tablet BUT, that's not what I paid for.If a functioning camera is a consideration in buying this tablet then BEWARE!!! you may get a lemon!Again, other then that I am enjoying it and the other things on it that do work wellregards,R Frey

tablet_galaxy_tab|We recently bought two (one for me and one for my wife) of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2's for portable use to check e-mail, watch video, and keep up with the news. The tablet exceeded my expectations. It has an intuitive interface and thus easy to use, compared to non-smart cell phones. It has a clear, sharp, and readable display, even for my old tired eyes. The tablet has a reasonable performance for the price, but I never owned a tablet, so I am comparing it to notebooks and lap-tops that I use. There were some comments by other reviewers on the camera, but I cannot comment on it, since we did not use it. We have other good compact digital cameras that are versatile enough for all of our photography needs. I strongly recommend considering this little package for recreational Internet surfing. You cannot beat it in features for the price.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Order them the week of March 11, 2013 and I got them March 18, 2013. Very fast shipping, great price, and they work wonderful. I would recommend to anyone and would buy from them again. I got this to use in school and i found out I could download open office works great. I haven't any trouble with it. I will update later.(March 19 2013)Have had time to play around with the devicePicture Quality for me is very good and that's without wearing my glasses I need all the time.Downloading things I have not yet had problem with anythingSounds for me I think is awesomeBattery life charged it full before using it. I used facebook, hulu, email, games pictures for about a total of 6 hrs and my battery was only down to 89% that is great.Charger works great.Touch screen works great.my boyfriend says he wants one now lolwill update in a week or two.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is the best electronic device I have ever purchased. So many uses. I use it everyday. Great for traveling because of the size and long-lasting battery.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really like all the things you can do with this tablet. From what I can tell it does everything and more then it's supposed to. I can't put it down.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great product for a great price! I bought one for my mom, too, so we could skype. It doesn't seem to advertise that the camera is reversible but it does and it handles everything I need!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Everything is fine with this tablet. Totally happy having bought it. Highly recommend it to everybody. I wish that it would be in white color.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had it for about a month and enjoy the ease of use and the amount of power it has to run things. If you are inthe market for a tablet to play around with and dont need al the major bells and whistles (dont get me wrong this has plenty) this is the one to get. With all the free online storage accessible from the tab I havnt even bought a sd card yet
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i chose cause it was in my price range when i was looking for a tablet i saw it had so many good reviews so i picked it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really have no complaints. It does everything I need. Games for grandchildren, email, weather. But I still have problems typing on it, I use a stylus, but it is small and I do have some trouble with accuracy. But that is not the real reason I bought it. For me it is inexpensive and serves its purpose.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Excellent Product, just whatt I expected, funcional, very nice and practical. Recomended 100 % for everybody. Quality and economy together.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I just love it can't put it down. Would not trade it for nothing. It has more features than i realized.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love it! I was worried about not being able to do my school work on my tab but I haven't had any problems. It has an app almost like Microsoft Office and I love it. I use it for school, to listen to music, and other personal use.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my daugther who is 10 and she loves it! She downloads all the apps she wants and watches netflix.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|One of the best tablets on the market today. Online help manual is great but really I set it up without it. I purchased the 32 gig micro card also. I have tons of music and 18 movies stored on the micro card with room for more. The only thing that I would like to see improved would be the micro card slot cover. The cover looks like it could brake and the card is small and hard to get out but it is not a big problem as it will be left in most of the time. This is a well constructed tablet and it is pretty fast and smooth running. Battery life is super long. The WI-FI setup was real easy to set up. Just turned the tablet on and it found the connection. Mail setup was a was a snap, just type in your e-mail address and the tablet did the rest. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE GALAXY TAB 2 & 7 INCH DISPLAY & WI-FI. (plus buy the 32 gig micro card)DMD

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Ok so I love the tablet. I think the only thing I would rate this a 1 star is the charge/ data cable.come on folks a 3 foot cord limits what u can do. Id recomend you to swap with a 6.5' cord. Make better sales that way.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Small enough to put in my purse, screen big enough for everyone to enjoy the skype images,,,can't be without it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I like this stuff a lot cool gadget to have better than Ipad. Was so impressed by the design and features
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had mine for a month now. It has all the bells and whistles that i wanted in a tablet. The one problem is moving my apps to the external sd card. For some reason i am not able to move these apps and I am running out of room. Please help if you know how to hack this and move the apps.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I finally got something through the mail thats worth the money for a change. I rate this product a low 5, strong 4.5. I would have loved to have had the owners manual shipped w/it also. I did go online to download the manual, but thats was a waste of time. Instead of the manual, the site kept trying to sell me stuff I didn't want or need, and it wanted me to download a new toolbar. Anyway I just read the manual online w/out downloading anything, for this tab. it started on page 16. Anyhow, me and the kids are enjoying this, and being that this is my first one, I will be getting another one thanks to the price. I do recommend this tab for the skeptics like myself if you're cautious about spending your hard earned dough. This one is worth the effort, if its your first one, or a kool gift for someone.

tablet_galaxy_tab|My son is in Kindergarten but is extremely tech saavy. We had many arguments about my phone being his personal playground and after running my battery dead on numerous occasions I banned him altogether. I got him the Samsun Galaxy Tab 2 for Christmas and peace has been restored to our home. He uses the camera nonstop, plays games in the car, Grandma takes video of his sports, he skypes, it's amazing. Our kids are growing up in a tech saavy world and this tablet works perfectly for us.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Excellent images, very good sound, quickly wi-fi conection, a lot of games to download. I bought it for me but now my son wants one.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is the first piece of technology I've ever gotten that was over $100. I'd say that it is well worth the $200 plus shipping. I am very impressed, and it compairs to my gramdmothers $600 tablet. The screen quality is amazing along with the sound. It's a little smaller than I expected, but it fits perfectly in my hand and is really easy to use. I'm actually typing this review with it. I am truely satisfied with this cute little tablet. Only wished I could have it on a data plan. Buy this tablet. You wont be disappointed. :)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It is convenient and useful for me, The quality is very good. Only one time the system halted, I don't know why. I haven't find any other problem.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Super fast shipping and item is exactly as described! Got it for my mom's birthday and she really loves it! She's happy and I'm happy! It is similar to the Samsung Galaxy S III and equally fast!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really liked this product. They note that it is very good quality and works perfectly. It is noted that in drafting cared much detail. I'd highly recommend
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Its a great product, much better than the kindle fire, actually it up there with the ipad, plus it plays flash and its only 250.00. its a great deal. love my new samsung galaxy tab 2.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased the 7inch Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 out of necessity for a portable web browser, daily organizer, and general digital toy. It delivers in all pertinent areas:-Ice Cream Sandwich is a strong OS for any level tablet user, beginner to expert.-The screen is bright, high quality, and very responsive.-As support for newer apps is integrated, this tablet is definitely the strongest platform for them.-Easy to make the transition to Ice Cream Sandwich from Apple iOSCONS:-Sub-par camera (though I rarely use it)-Not all apps for previous versions of Android are fully supported yet (but that's the developers' issue)Unless the camera is important to you, buy this tablet if you're in the market for one.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tablet and first exposure to android. I really like the unit and am stumbling along learning how to use it. The lack of a user manual beyond the micro sized print pamphlet is definately a hinderance for me as a new user. I am trying to use the one for the galaxy plus which is helpful but a manual for this device should have been created prior to its release. Hopefully Samsung will edit the galaxy plus manual on their web site to match the galaxy 2 or write a new one soon. There are features I purchased this unit for that I have not been able to use due to lack of documentation. One star off for this.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Really love this tablet, I was really worried that a 7 inch screen would be too small and I might regret buying it, however, as it turns out the display screen is really comfortable and it made the device really portable!Another thing I love about this tablet is the battery life, I was able to do almost 4 days of youtube, surfing, games, music and downloading apps which really satisfied my needs.Finally, I really do recommend this android tablet as it is a good price to pay for a great device, and you won't regret it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|While I waited for the new Kindle HD to come out to replace my old Kindle Keyboard 3G, I had been reading about all the different tablets that are out there. The more I used my smartphone, a Droid Maxx, the more I wanted a tablet so I could do the same stuff only on a larger screen including reading my Kindle books. After the arrival of the new Kindle I got serious about comparison tablet shopping. I decided that I wanted to keep the same size as my old kindle - not the screen size but overall size as you can hold it in one hand and its very portable in a purse etc. I also didn't want the high price iPad or the new Windows tablet. (I have a laptop for serious work.) So I eventually narrowed down the choice between the Kindle Fire HD, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7" and the Google Nexus. After much analysis and reading reviews I chose the Galaxy for the following reasons: While I love Amazon, I prefer to stay with the Andriod OS so that I don't have to learn a whole other way of life and can set up my devices similiarly; For about $40 more the Galaxy is expandable with a 32GB memory card and it has a front & rear camera; the Nexus costs more isn't expandable and only has one camera. These are just a few reasons. I have forgotten the rest cause I am so pleased with my choice. I have owned it for 4 days now and have some basic things set up on it and will start to play with the camera etc. I had no problems with it recognizing our WiFi. I just have to remember to turn off the WiFi to save the battery life as I did on my Kindle.I bought the Supcase cover for it which fits perfectly and allows for 3 viewing positions and great protection. I had purchased clear screen protectors but have now ordered non-glare ones as I like to read outside and prefer not to see my reflection while reading! I spent alot of time studying all the information on the tablets, screen protectors and cases and I am very pleased with my choice and the prices from Amazon.10/10/12 Yesterday I received the Clear Shield Utra Matte finish screen protectors. It works great...no more glare but you do loose a litte in clarity but worth it outdoors. The protector was easy to put on and a perfect fit. My husband is now playing Bad Piggies on it and I think I may have him convinced to get this tablet too. Wait til tries the TV remote set-up!

tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is the perfect size, and for the most part I prefer it over my Kindle Fire (same size). The Kindle Fire has a crippled Android OS that won't run all of the apps that this tablet can. With this tablet, I can load all kinds of reader apps like Kindle, Barnes & Noble, Sony, Aldiko, etc. Why limit myself to just Kindle? Plus I can run most Android apps from the Android Market. With Kindle, you are limited to just what you can get from the Kindle store. I can't fault Amazon too much on this, since their main objective was to get the cheapest e-Reader on the market as fast as they can so they can sell more books.Now, on to the one major flaw. This tablet only has 8GB of internal memory of which only 4.48GB is useable for applications from what I can tell. I have since filled up this memory with Kindle books and applications. Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich) doesn't support moving apps to the external SD card like the previous versions. The 32GB external SD card I have installed in this tablet is absolutely worthless. From searching the web high and low, it appears that this is not a bug but a design feature. Apparently, Google just wants the external card to be used for storing media files and nothing else. They figure a tablet should have plenty of internal storage and not have the same issues as phones. I hope Google will change their mind on this quick. My Samsung Galaxy Epic II phone doesn't have this storage problem, but it's running Android 2.3.6 (Gingerbread). It now holds far more apps and e-books than my tablet does LOL.

tablet_galaxy_tab|It's amazing how little marketing this awesome tablet is receiving. I've shown this device to a couple of my coworkers, fellow software and hardware engineers, and they all seemed highly interested and made aware that this tablet even existed.My brother owned a Kindle Fire and I got a chance to play around with it. I liked the size, form factor and price. However, the dealbreaker was the lack of a SD/micro SD card slot. As an avid photographer, it would be nice to pull out my cards and view them from a larger screen. Fortunately, I ran into an article stating that Samsung was going to release a 7" tablet that would retail $250 that would include the micro SD slot, in addition, front and rear cameras, GPS, and IR blaster (Note: IR is nice to have, but currently the app that comes with it is flakey - sw issue/ not hw). Compared to the Fire aside from all those extra components, is that it's also much lighter, thinner and easier to hold.From reading some of the reviews, I've noticed that there are complaints regarding the 8GB built in memory and the inability to transfer apps to the SD card. I currently have about 60 apps installed on the tablet with 3.88GB to spare - no rooting done to remove bloatware, mind you. Media (photos/video/docs) generally uses most of the memory, which if that is the culprit, can be alleviated by transferring via dropbox/app of choice/cable or the micro SD card (also you can change settings to have pics save to card) ;)The gyroscope, or the screen rotation rather, is a bit laggy and it does take about 2 seconds to kick in portrait/landscape mode. Video streaming is smooth and internet browsing works fine with a wifi-dsl connection. Brightness can be easily adjusted by tapping the right hand corner in whatever screen you are in - no need to exit app and dig through the menu.The front and back camera is not very good, pictures taken from it are a tad grainy and noisey - when viewed from the device itself. But hey if you're gonna be picky, you just saved several hundred bucks so you CAN go buy a real camera!!Cable that comes with is about 3' long, users might find it a tad short to be plugged in while in use.Though I pointed out some of the negatives just to make folks aware, in my eyes, they are not dealbreakers. The apps and browsing mechanism works reasonably well and I've used it for a few weeks now with no problems.Overall, a handy device and best bang for your buck on tablets released as of June 2012.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I just received this item yesterday, 4-24-2012. I really like this Android tablet. The set up process was super easy, the tablet does everything for you...all I had to do was fill in the blanks...very easy!It allows you to customize widgets and gives you access to the android market. I have a Samsung Epic 4g cell phone, and all my favorite applications from my phone are now on my tablet.Battery Life is great so far. My toddler was playing his games and then he watched a movie on Netflix and the battery was at still 75% after at least an hour of prior use. It was easy enough for my toddler to navigate through also.WiFi works great, no issues or problems there.I can also get all of my Kindle books right onto the tablet, which was nice too.Both cameras produces crisp and clear images, have not tried the video camera yet.The touch screen is sensitive enough and the keyboard is accurate. I like the qwerty keyboards, but I don't find myself having to constantly use the back arrow to correct spelling, it seems to be pretty accurate.There is still a lot to do and try, but I am satisfied with my purchase...Thanks Amazon!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I was going to buy a Kindle Fire but it lacked a few features that I really wanted in a Tablet. I wanted a camera for skyping and I wanted more than 4GB of memory. This Tablet has TWO cameras (Front and Rear) and is expandable up to 32GB! So far it has been amazing and for only $50 more than a Kindle Fire it was well worth it. It does start to operate slow every now and then but if you go into task manager and clear the RAM or download an APP Killer it works great. I got about 20 hours out of my first battery charge, but that included dowloading apps all night and playing with all of the features. I couldn't put the thing down! Perfect size for me and does everything I want it to.My Girlfriend has an Apple iPad 2, which is very nice, but I find it to be a bit cumbersome. In fact I think she is a bit jealous of my Galaxy Tab! It does everything hers does and more.. by more I mean you can watch Flash based videos, navigate using GPS and add 32GB of external memory for less than half the price.Great product so far...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|LCD = Made from Samsung.Memory = Made from Samsung.Only Samsung can do this spec with this price.I was very impressed with Galaxy Tab 2 with $250.Apple Ipad 3 = 1GB memory,Apple Ipad 2 = 512MB memory.Galaxy Tab 2 = 1GB memory.8GB internal memory + expansion slot for 32 GBSamsung quality LCD = Ipad is using Samsung LCD.Galaxy Tab 2 has everything with $250.00.Of course it has lack of contents than Apple, but I am very sure that developers will create more apps after sold this much.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I already own a Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; and was excited to compare it with the Galaxy Tab 2 7&#34; which I bought for my sister. What I can tell you after a week of comparison, is that the performance, display resolution, internet browsing, games behavior, operating system usability, etc., on the Galaxy Tab 2 7&#34; is FAR BETTER in my experience than the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; (which the only advantage would be the HDMI video output).If you're looking for an everyday or school tablet which gives you the possibility of editing documents, do internet browsing and more, this is the one for sure! :)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This device puts my iPad to shame! The only category that my iPad wins in, is battery life. Definitely worth the money. Awesome picture.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love my Samsung Stratosphere android phone, so after much research, I opted for the Samsung Galaxy Tablet. So far, I really like it. The only things that I think they can improve on are the glare and the digital keyboard that sometimes falters. Otherwise, I think this was a fairly decent purchase for the price, and for what I use it for, which is primarily watching Netflix, reading on my Kindle, games and general entertainment.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It is rather good tab for me. Sometimes touches did not register. But it is really a good tab at this price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought the original kindle fire for my girlfriend but it was stolen, so we decided to buy the Galaxy Tab 2 (7 inch). It was the best choice because we live in Ecuador and we can't use a lot of Amazon services over there but we do have access to the Google Play store and free apps on the Galaxy Tab. It is pretty fast and customizable, you can add a 32GB mini sd card, it has a front & rear camera and multi touch screen... It's a tool we use every day.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought it for my father who is a retired person. I found he is very happy with the performance of the tab and I am also satisfied. Specially at this price, it is perfect and complete tablet. Thanks to samsung.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was my first time purchasing a refurbished item I was scared thinking it would have problems but I was totally wrong it was delivered early and it looks and work as if its brand new I haven't had any problems will definitely buy from this company again
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Simply put, for $199 i don't think you can do any better. I'm extremely happy with the fit and finish of this tablet for the price. To keep it very simple, it has every option I would expect, plus many more. If you are saving up for the Apple, don't!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this to replace my Kindle. I have three of them. I went to the Kindle Fire, but filled it up with music with no room left for books. This was just before Amazon came out with all the new Fires. I know that I have the Amazon Cloud, but I spend a lot of time on airplanes and out of country. If Amazon added a microSD slot, I'd buy the Fire. But..... now that I've tried the Samsung Tab, I am very happy. Fire.... Tab with microSD...... I'm gonna stick with the Samsung. I use it for reading my Amazon purchased collection anyway. Plus, I like being able to decide what goes on my tablet. I don't need or want mother Amazon telling me what to do with my device.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The tablet was shipped and received quickly. Everything worked fine no problem thus far. I would recomend it to a friend.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Is simple, you cant spend 380 USD for a mini Ipad but never ever would be much better than this one, not for the Price difference... Galaxy Tab 2 is really AWESOME for 170 USD... LOVE IT...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I received this as a birthday gift on Thursday April 11th 2013, and it's amazing!Pros:. Very easy to setup (especially if you already have a Gmail account). Good battery life, on fairly heavy use it lasted me 14 hours but it would last your average user about a day and a half without needing a charge. The battery life really depends on the user though, it depends on things like, screen brightness, apps running in the back ground, GPS and other things being on when the don't need to be. Needless to say you won't have to worry about charging it in the middle of the day because the battery last all day long.. It's very user friendly and doesn't take very much time to get use to at all, took me about 20 minuets of messing around with it to fully grasp how this device works.. Very portable! I never really understood how much more portable tablets are compared to laptops until I got this.. Overall picture quality is very crisp! I've only had this thing for two days and watched at least 20 Youtube videos, mostly music videos and a couple of Netflix shows, all in 720p HD, the display is very bright, I mean dangerously bright and vibrant!. Super customizeable! There really isn't a limit as to what you can't do on this thing. I love how I can customize the lock screen with my favorite pictures, security features and even the option to write a message on the lock screen. I put my name in the message box just in case it ever gets lost or stolen so there wouldn't be any fuss as to who's device it is.. Perfect size for me, if you don't want something as big as a 10 inch tablet but still want the screen to be big enough to fully enjoy great resolution quality of your videos and pictures than this is definitely the tablet for you, if you want a larger screen I'd recommend the 10 inch version of this tablet, which I have also used. It's awesome too!. It has flash support!. Expandable memory via Micro SD card up to 32GB, I absolutely love that feature! Unlike the I pad you don't have to pay an extra $100 just for an extra 32GB of space, which I find ridiculous. Just order a 32GB card from Sandisk for $20 bucks or a 16GB card for $5 and you're good to go.. Front facing camera great for skype, oovoo and other webcam apps.. Runs very smooth with no delays on the touch screen.Minor cons. Overall design could have been better in my opinion, it has a somewhat unattractive back cover, that is just kinda bland, but lets be honest here. The fist thing everyone does when they get a smart device is throw a case on it anyways, well I know I did anyways, so this really wasn't an issue for me.. Like I said before the brightness can literally hurt your eyes if you have it cranked up high for long periods of time, not to mention excessive screen brightness drains your battery a lot faster than it normally would drain.. Camera Quality isn't the best but it's not bad either, I think it could be a little better but considering the ridiculous bargain price of the tablet and the fact that there is actually even a camera on the thing unlike the Kindle Fire HD it's really not that bad of a flaw.I personally believed that there was absolutely no way that you're going to get a quality tablet for under $200, man was I wrong. I was dead wrong! Overall I'm very satisfied with this tablet and to be honest, the price is a steal, it's really worth more than what it sells for, I'm so glad I asked for this over the Kindle Fire HD. I had second thoughts before I got it but now that it's here in my hands I have absolutely no regrets what so ever! And as someone who has used the ipad 2, ipad 3, HP touchpad, and the kindle fire HD, I can honestly say with an unbiased opinion that you will not regret buying one of these, or giving it to someone as a gift, they'd love it. I would highly recommend this to a friend, it's a quality device for a low price, doesn't get much better than that.I'll update this review in the future if any thing else comes up that I think you should know about this tablet before purchasing it.UPDATE#1Pros:.You can make phone calls as long as you're connected to WiFi with the Magic Jack app. It's free forever and easy to use also they give you your own personal phone number and voice mail.. The GPS works fairly well without being connected to WiFi, so it's perfect for use on the road.Cons:.The speakers aren't that great. They play loud and clear but both of the speakers are on the bottom of the tablet so if you tilt the device to the side to watch a video all of the sound is going to come from the right or left depending on which way you tilt it. This isn't a major flaw but it noticeable and when you're using your speakers and it leaves an unbalanced sound that I find rather annoying. I just use my Beats by Dre headphones when ever I use the thing so i'm happy, if you have headphones or ear bud's you'll probably find your experience with this device more enjoyable, though they're not needed.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Hi,I was watching (or trying) to watch some YouTube videos last night wondering why my Tab 2 kept pending the videos. I thought at first it was my internet connection but then i was able to watch the same video on my Samsung Galaxy S2 cellphone and it worked. After i tried to use my Tab 2 again and then it went dead. I thought it was some gliche so i tried to turn it on again using the power button and nothing worked. I set it aside and went to bed, woke up the next day and tried to turn it on again and nada.Of course, next morning, i am freaking out now &#34;hoping&#34; i didn't get some product that just went ka-put. I plugged it in to charge and turn it on, again nada. I went online and saw someone else's instructions that I should hold it for a full 30-seconds....i tried that and it worked! It popped up the battery showing it totally drained, so at least i felt better knowing it really was just dead. I had read another review saying they had the same similar problems and they didn't realize it went dead due to the battery getting drained from watching a video or some file they were downloading that just happened to take a very long time, so long that on a lower battery already it just drained the entire thing.Other than that I absolutely LOVE this thing. Wish it had flash though....there are some websites i can't access because there is no flash or JavaScript on this thing...other than that i am so glad i got the 7&#34; screen and not the 10&#34;....sometimes i feel like i could have even done with something smaller than 7&#34;....maybe more like 5 or 6&#34; just because i am a woman and have small hands.

tablet_galaxy_tab|My tab arrived several days before the scheduled arrival and was packaged nicely. I have used it nearly every day since it arrived and am more than satisfied. The tab is very responsive and does much more than I thought. Seems like I find something new nearly every time I use it. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a basic tablet. It connects to Wi-Fi quickly and easily. This is my second 7&#34; tablet. The first was a Koby Kyros. It was nice but the Tab 2 is a nice upgrade.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased one for my 9 year old granddaughter and she would bring it over and I would dabble with it ..liked it so much I decided to purchase one for myself and I absolutely love it...I am rarely on my laptop anymore as this size is very easy to manuver around from room to room. I am glad that I bought this 7&#34; Samsung tablet esp.for the size . As always I am a firm believer in Samsung products. Jerr

tablet_galaxy_tab|I am very pleased with this tablet. After doing much research, I found the Tab 2 {7 inch} to be best for my needs. It is the perfect size for someone who does not want to carry around a bigger tablet. If I want a bigger screen, I may as well use my laptop.Everything works as expected. The battery charge lasts for quit awhile. Shipping was prompt.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my 2nd Galaxy Tab a replacement for the first tablet which bricked it's last time after three years. Upgrades are noticeable, much faster , better screen resolution, camera resolution is improved. This is the perfect size for me as a reader ,used also a tv remote,web browser . The keyboard is very different in this model (probably just a learning curve issue. This is thinner, more balanced and easier to hold with the beveled edges. Speaker difference is huge,this has way better speakers with a suprsingly good sound for a tablet of this size (WAY better than 1st version). My experiance with battery life so far seems about the same.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm able to see a red dot in the middle of the screen and I'm not sure whether its usual or something wrong with that, please update me. Overall this product is worth it for the money.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It's size is very convenient (fits easily in my wife's purse) but large enough to read and type with long fingernails. Mail app makes reviewing email (yahoo) very easy. Love to play games on it such as Candy Crush and Bubble Worlds. Searching the Internet is easy. Have had the tablet for a month and have had no problems with it. Battery life is good, lasts about a day and a half with moderate use. Wold recommend this product highly, already have to many in my family.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|has fast response to commands and comes with a nice set of apps. highly recommended. even better as it was a free promo with a tv.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|For those that are buying this for a kid or who IS a kid (like me!), I would SURELY reccomend it!! I recieved this tablet for my birthday and love it!! I was easily able to download all my favorite games, like Bakery Story, Angry Birds, Doodle Jump, Scrabble, Draw Something, ect! Even my favorite 3D games, like Super Monkey Ball Sakura Edition, Riptide GP, and Style Me Girl run perfect! All the adults reviewing this tablet said they dont appreciate the camera on the back, but I love taking pictures with it and then uploading them to PicsArt to edit them! The camera is the reason I chose this over the Nexus 7. No, I dont feel like a fool using it to take pictures, because it has more editing possibiltes, and since I dont have a smartphone, my cellphone takes really bad pictures. Maybe its because Im 12, but I actually think the quality is fine, I recently used it to take pics on a family vacation :). The battery life is nice, with the screen on high and the Wi-Fi on, I get 7 hours of juice! I read a book required for school on my Galaxy Tab, and I encountered no problems. Youtube is nice quality also. I used Netflix to watch 2 whole seasons of Pretty Little Liars, and it looked HD! I also use the Flixter app to watch Ultra Voilet copies of our Blu Ray DVDs, and I can download them to the built in Video Player to watch them without Wi-Fi, which is great for entertainment during road trips! I dont know why people say you cant stream Amazon Instant and Prime Videos, because I watched a 1 hr and 30 minute movie and it was fine! You have to be connected to Wi-Fi, though.Overall, I LOVE his tablet, and I suggest it to any kid OR adult!

tablet_galaxy_tab|After having my Samsung Galaxy Tablet 2 (7.0 - 8GB) for about two weeks, it is one of my constant companions!! I have had no problems at all. I did download the Manual in PDF format from their Site; putting the Shortcut on my PC's Desktop. The Manual was a help mate in the initial days of learning about the functionality of the Tablet.I have come to utilize five Home Screens; using one just for utilizing the syncing of calendar, memos and contacts from my PC Outlook Program; one for financial programs and charts; and one for programs collecting news. Widgets come in handy for showing graphical charts and pictures associated with various Apps. The interface makes it so easy to customize the placement of apps and widgets on the Home Screens. Sometimes the interface is sensitive when one touches a widget or app icon. One has to tap quickly to execute the app or widget; otherwise the System thinks that you want to rearrange the icon on the Home Screen. I have around 67 apps plus numerous widgets on the system; and yet, I am only utilizing 669MB of the total 4.59GB available for personal usage. And I am not even mentioning the additional 32GB I have from my SD Card.Some of the Apps that I have downloaded are the Thumbs Plus Keyboard, the PowerAmp App (which really turns the already great tiny speakers into a full blown mono/stereo system (G)), Wifi Analyzer, eWeather HD, Dolphin HD Browser, An Money Plus Finance (in importing/exporting ".qif" files from my desktop Quicken Program), ASTRO File Manager/Browser Pro, Deja Office Outlook Sync (which includes a desktop program to sync Outlook data to the Tablet - Great App, by the way!), News Republic for Tablet, KJV Bible, MyCar Locator and Tunein Radio Pro (my favorite). With Tunein Radio Pro, I have almost tossed my clock radio for it. (LOL) One can utilize its sleep timer adjusting the time from 15 up to 120 minutes. One may also utilize its one alarm setting in selecting a radio station, repeat sequence, time of the alarm, and volume.Other items that I have obtained in implementing the use of my tablet are:Galaxy Tab Samsung Multimedia DockPoetic Slimbook Leather Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 Black(Included 2 Micro SD Card Slots) (Business Card Holder is Plus) (3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic)Well, back to the Tab 2. (LOL)!! By the way, I have used it at five places, and it had no problem in finding Wifi hotspots at each location.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I've always been interested in tech at thirteen years old. i have a laptop an ipod touch and several other devices. i searched for a long time in order to find a good 7 inch tablet and i believe i found it.pros:-very smooth running (gets glitchy time to time but just turn off the screen for a few seconds and it should be fine)-android market and apps run great-fast internet browsing (with dolphin hd and stock browser)-good batery life( could be better but sure beats apple, also there are things to do to increase the battery life.)-perfect screen size (i chose seven inches because the normal 10 inch tablets were too big. the 7 inch screen easly fits into my pocket and is perfect for videos and browsing)-nice design and screen (gets finger prints but easy to clean)-android 4.0 ice cream sandwich runs great on it (should get jelly bean by the end of July)-great camera (awesome outdoors but still good indoors)-amazing speakers!-the buttons feel nice and solidcons (few but some)-gets glitchy time to time-could have better battery life-apps that won't work on tablets still show up in the android market-memory (an sd card is a must have, you only get about 5gbs of storage and you can't put apps on the sd card. 5gb is enough for plenty of apps so long as you tell every thing to save onto the sd card.All an all this is an amazing device and after using other tablets at the store after i bought these nothing compares. I haven't had a chance to play with the nexus7 yet but from specs and reviews it seems like the galaxy tab 2 is the all over winner. this is a great device and worth your money.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my second tab. After having a hand-on for last two day i must say this is a nice tab in this price range - $250.The only thing which may take this into backstep that is the camera. It does not have a quality camera ( either in front or rear).ecerything elase is good and upto the expectation.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really enjoy my samsung tab2 7. I watch a lot of videos, read a large amount of ebooks and also listen to audiobooks. Its great outside, even in the sun. I get a great deal of use out of it when I wake up during the night. I can read a book without turning on the light and since I also got a very nice holder which rotates it makes it easy to watch videos or read in bed. Worth every penny!! Its great when I just finish a book and can find more by the author and instantly buy it and have it on my galaxy or on my Iphone. I love this technology and it works great with amazons kindle ebooks and audiobooks. If I am reading a book on one device it lets me know where I left off reading on the other device that is awesome!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a very well build nice tablet, which does its job without any problems. It is not a performance monster, nor a very poor machine. It has a very good performance/price ratio.I am actually very happy that I didn't had to re-configure every bit of software like I did in my previous Samsung Android phones. Samsung did a nice job this time by focusing more on the software.The battery life is good. Although not an OLED, screen is okay. There was a small brighter area on bottom left of my screen, but it doesn't bother me since I'm not doing any graphic work with it. I haven't faced any problems with wireless or bluetooth. Both worked nicely in my house with my wireless router or paired with my phone. The infrared control could have been fun if I was living in US. But it is pretty useless right now.Only problematic part is the terrible terrible camera. I wish they didn't even put it there. It is really awful. And I mean really awful like my iPhone 3GS which dates to 2009.My point in buying this device was to relieve me carrying my laptop around but giving me chance to browse the web, to use social sharing applications and to be able to communicate with video. All in all, this is a great product for its price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This little tablet is great!! Even Touchwiz on ICS is solid. Has a arrow that pops up Widgets that overlay apps like a Calculator, Notepad, Memo, Task list. So when I'm using Mint I can use the calculator and be in Mint at the same time. That to me was very impressive. It's true multitasking. I feel like everything is 1-2 clicks away. I bought the Memory adapter that gives me an extra 32GB of storage when I need/want it and have up to 72GB of storage. It's loaded with all my music and movies. The Peel app let's me use it as a remote control for my TV. I haven't gone anywhere without it, since it fits so easily in my backpocket.This tablet has made me an Android Fanboy for sure. It does everything an iPad doesn't: 7", Widgets, In Browser flash, Touchwiz, Built in Remote receiver, Torrent downloader, expandable storage...etc.the seller was also great. I paid for overnight around noon and got it the next day in great condition. Definitely happy with my purchase.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Hey! I got the Galaxy Tab 2 today at Best Buy and it is Awesome!! and Wow! with this tablet you do get a lot for only $249.99 and now I can easily forget about comeing up with $600 to get the iPad. Way to go Samsung, with the price of this tablet you saved me $350. also the detail on the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 screen looks great!! and the Galaxy tab 2's WiFi works great with my linksys wireless router, and the 7 inch size is just right, and I also like the Android Ice Cream Sandwich OS.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My iPad 1 was starting to show its age, so I decided it was time for something newer. I had gone to Best Buy with the intention of purchasing a Kindle Fire, but after playing with it I just wasn't feeling it. I didn't like the heavily modified version of Android they run, and not having an SD card seems like a really odd decision to make. I was set to buy a bigger and more expensive tablet when I saw the display for the Tab 2 set off away from the other tablets, so I wandered over and checked it out, and I liked it immediately.The form factor is nice. I loved the large size of my iPad, but for reading in bed it is a bit too large and heavy. I dealt with it because its a fantastic device, but now that it was time to get a new one, I opted for something a little smaller.The only issues I have come across is that the stock UI can be a little laggy, so I opted to use a 3rd party launcher which immediately fixed the problem. The other problem seems to be more with Android and less with Samsung, but the new MTP protocol that is used to transfer files to your computer does not work natively with Mac/OS X, and you have to get a piece of software from google to do this. However even with the software my computer still won't recognize the device at all. The only way I can get files on and off my device is either with a SD card, or using a program that lets me connect wirelessly via an FTP application. Is it the end of the world? No. Is it a slight inconvenience? Yes.Aside from those two small issues this thing has performed well and I am really enjoying it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet was much better than the HP tablet I previously had.My friend just bought the nexus 10 and that thing is amazing!So I would definitely suggest going through every tablet and looking atthe reviews because I wish I would have done a more thorough search.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Excellent purchase, arrived in perfect love with my galaxy tab, high quality sound and picture. I spend hours discovering the tab functions
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this for christmas and I love all the things I can do on it. Don't have anything bad to say about this device at all except that it only charges from it's original charger, but it holds a long charge, so that's not even a big issue. Camera takes really good photos too!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought it as a recommendation of my daughters.I work on my PC all the time, so I was hesitating to add another electronic device to my routine, but finally I made my mind and I acquired it. It was one of my best decisions. I recommend it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The only thing I will say is that I am very satisfied with my tablet, does everything I need and expect from her.

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Galaxy Tab rocks! It's the perfect size, I can read all of my ebooks on it, I can play games, take pictures, listen to music, and many other great things with it. I really love that it's powered by android!

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|First time having a tab it really is awesome to some points still need to work on it a little bit more to understand the features more. The only set back is the google store downloads take too long or not at all.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The screen is very clear and crisp. Works great on Wifi. Have never lost a signal or have any issues maintaining one. Downloads quickly. Everything runs very smooth. My toddler loves to play with it as well. Will be buying a second one.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this item for my, for her birthday. I had never purchased a tablet before and so have little to compare the item to. That being said my wife loves it. She has more experience with tablets and raves about ease of use and loves the interaction features and configurations. I purchased this item based on reviews and the price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Purchased this for my husband for Valentine's Day, he wanted it so we could use it while Jeeping, instead of purchasing a GPS, it works great and he loves it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|very nice, use it everyday. Fast shipping. would reccomend to friends. I have bought a lot from amazon and will continue to do so.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great product at a fraction the price of an Ipad. Great tablet for viewing movies on vacation.The battery life isn't as long as advertised but still acceptable.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I ordered this tablet for my wife. This was our first android based device. So far I really like the product. It is low on battery, and needs frequent charging. Overall the performance has been satisfying.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my personal tablet. I do everything with this thing from web searches to controling the TV. Delivered on time, I am completely satisfied.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I buy this for my daughter and she is enjoying every moment of it. I will get one for myself.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|this has been a great unit except one thing.Sometimes it charges good and other times not at all.Ive been trying to get the problem resolved with samsung but very slow going.Would i buy again,problely not
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Ok this tablet isn't as snappy as an iPad, but for the price.. it's really great! It start to run slow when you have more than 3 apps open so it kinda sucks having to close apps so you can use it properly, however it is a great tablet and the size is just great. One complaint and feature I would like it to have is an HDMI connection.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|nice product compact saves space looking forward to taking on trips and enjoying it greatlywi fi is great and fast
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought 2 of these for my kids, they love them and we haven't had any problems with them and when I am able I am going to try to buy one for myself!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I researched and compared the iPad to the Galaxy Tab and found the Galaxy a better fit for me. I don't download many things like music and movies so i didn't want to spend so much money on features i won't use. I decided on the 7.0 because it is easy to put in my purse and go!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Gave this tablet to my husband for Christmas (Cyber Monday). Great deal! He wanted to use it for downloading games, movies and music and to search the internet on his breaks at work. He really likes the quick speed of the tablet, the crisp images, and ease of use, and rather good battery life. (note: I did get the 32 gb memory for extra storage, just in case, not sure if my husband would really even need it, but always good to have).
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've had this for a year, or so. Early on it seemed to be a bit cumbersome doing some tasks. But, it works very well, now. I'm not sure why. It could be some updates. I also recommend a stylus which makes ease of use even better.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had my Tab 2 7.0 for about 2 months now and I'm loving it. Although I can see the appeal of the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1,(my husband has one) I just love my 7.0. It is just the right size to take with me everywhere.(After I slipped on my cute MoKo 360 Rotating Case, of course) I just popped in my sd card and logged in to the Google setup, and my Google Play account did the rest. All my apps from my phone downloaded to my tab.This tab is fast and efficient. I am still discovering the cool things it can do. Like connect to my Xbox and play pics and videos through it wirelessly! Whaaat!? I love using the Overdrive app to borrow books from my library. My daughter gets to play games when we are out and I have access to all my docs with Google Drive. I have a lot of apps on my tab and I still have almost half of my 8gb of internal storage left. I was stuck between the Nexus and the Galaxy and finally opted for the Galaxy based on back camera and expandable memory.The screen looks great. Sound is pretty nice for the size of the speakers and it is super fast on the internet even when using bluetooth tether. Imagine my surprise when one day I turned on my tab to find the Jellybean update for Samsung waiting for me. I swear the tab is slightly faster and the display is even crisper now. There is only one thing that I would love to make this tab even better. Flash for the back camera. Speaking of Flash I was able to download an older version of Adobe Flash and now I can go to any website that still uses Flash. Good old Google Search, you can find anything!Samsung and Google have not disappointed with this easy to use and quality built tab that does not break the bank. (Sorry I-pad, I remain a Google gal)

tablet_galaxy_tab|A friend claims that his iPad changed his life. I used to laugh, but it's pretty true for me and my Tab 2. I don't have a smart phone, so this is my only mobile device. I got it for the e-reader capabilities, but I knew I'd want full Android capabilities as well. I was having chemo and didn't want to have to go to the store or library for books. Plus, I was falling asleep while reading, and my books would close or fall, and I'd lose my place. Coupled with the Poetic StandBook case, problem solved.Now chemo's over, and I use my Tab more than ever. I can see work email without running up the stairs to my computer, and I've gradually been adding apps. I haven't even explored all of the ways I could be using my Tab, but there's no hurry. When I do get a smart phone someday, it will likely be a Samsung too.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My wife was super excited to receive this Android tablet for Christmas. It is very easy to navigate, has a super sharp screen image and through the Google Play Store has access to almost any app she might ever want.Positives:Easy to set upEasy to navigateTouch screen is spot on (whereas on my parent's Kindle, it's always a little funky)Easy to readNegatives:Adobe doesn't support Flash for Android, so no Flash playerSound quality isn't the most amazing thing ever, but it's not like it's a Bose stereo or something.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Completeley what I expected and more, love it! Really work for just everything, I got it working right away and I been using it since!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet could be categorized in middle range tablet, not very good but better than the unknown brand tablets or single core ones. This tablet is not for games. N.O.V.A 3 is very laggy , slow and very low details in this tablet. The universal remote feature is very usefull, i used it for my Home Theater, Projector and cable box. Battery longs well, but less than my other tablet that i had ( ACER ICONIA TAB A200). I dont know why but the downloads are very slow in this tablet. I have a samsung galaxy s and tried the speedtest app on both, and the results were too different ( the galaxy s downloaded a lot of times faster than the tablet).My conclusion: for web browsing, email, documents and music this is your tablet. For intense processor apps, streaming and downloads, buy a tegra 3 tablet or amazon kindle.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've had the Tab 2 for three weeks now and just love it. My daughter was showing off her tab 10.1 at Christmas and we were all impressed with the screen and speed of the operating system, so I just had to get one for reading books. Two in our family have I pads and now want these Samsung tablets. Only the Kindle fire HD 8.9 at our party matched the screen and was a little better on the audio. Still learning and haven't figured out how text to speech can work with Kindle books, but sure it can be done. I have two Samsung TV sets with the latest being LED and 3D, Samsung Galaxy phone and a blue ray player. Never any problems and all high quality

tablet_galaxy_tab|First of all, I'm writing this review on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 :DFirst off, I'll talk about delivery.The Tablet was shipped right away (within 24 hours) of my purchasing it. The package arrived 2 days later (I'm on Amazon Prime) in wonderful condition. The shipping box as well as the original box were undamaged. The original box was also adequately protected.5/5 for shipping.Next I'll talk about the device.I've looked at a few other reviews, and I am confused as to why people complain about certain features. (such as the quality of the speakers, which aren't even that bad, or other various complaints over details) seriously people? It's a $200 Tablet that I find rivals other Tabs hundreds of dollars more than it. With this Tablet, you get what you pay for AND more.Perhaps my favorite feature is the external SD card (WARNING! THE EXTERNAL SD CARD WILL NOT STORE APPS. Due to piracy and licensing, apps on tablets are restricted to internal memory only.) despite not being able to store apps, I find the memory card suits my personality. I am a movie watcher and enjoy watching movies anywhere I go when I have free time (Road trips with family, doctors appointments, long lines at the college bookstore hahaha) thanks to my 32 GB SD card, I can have more than enough movies to keep me busy.I won't bore any readers with technical lingo and phrases describing the processing power and so on. Just know that this Tablet won't disappoint! (Unless you have unrealistic views on how far $200 can really go)Call me biased, but I would give this Tab a 5/5 and day of the week! Definitely worth the price :)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this for Christmas for my Daughter. She wanted the Ipad but I didn't want to spend $500 on that so we got her the Galaxy. It is fast, it has video and a camera so she can video her friends. This is perfect for her she is 11 and is on it all the time. Was also happy that you can create a playlist on ITunes and transfer it over. Easy too. Glad I didn't have to re buy all her favorite songs. We buy Google Play gift cards so we don't have to keep a credit card on file so she can purchase apps that aren't free. Would recommend it!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm very satisfied with the performance of the galaxy two tablet I'm glad that I purchased this one I've heard other reviews other products that don't add up to what I've seen that this will
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I would definately recommend this over the ipad! I run a small at-home business with my tablet. I use it for everything!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|likewould recommend it to family and friends great productthis product was new to me and took a little to find everything and turn off the save everything you look at but once i figured it all out its great.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Got it for my wife; she really enjoys it, not being a computer expert. Gets news and plays games. OK for a non-expert.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Handy. Nice and useful features. GPS facility even without wifi is helpful.Placing of on-off and volume buttons create some problems when unintentionaly touched. Same is the case with Home ibutton. Their location interferes with the natural holding position of the hand and fingers.While typing the visible space is extremely narrow hence only two lines of typing space is visible. To offset one has to turn the tablet 90 degrees (in verticle position).Can not fit in normal shirt pocket.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love my tablet! Researched and fretted for weeks about which to buy. Sold on the expandable to 32GB microSD slot, apps, Playstore, and 7-inch size. Perfect portable size. Any bigger and you might as well get a netbook or a notebook. This will fit in my purse. Already sold a couple of other people on this tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for a Christmas gift and it was a hit!! the fact thats its small enough to hold in one hand is a plus but it does everything I need it to do at a decent price! I would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for an affordable tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm not 'technical' enough to list a lot of things as to why I rated this tablet five stars but before I bought this one I have bought and sold (or traded) at least nine different tablets. My trading days are over. I LOVE THIS TABLET.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is exactly everything I wanted from an android tablet. It runs and acts just like any android smartphone minus the phone number. With google talk I can video chat, voice chat, or just text chat all through my gmail account. Same access to google play store with all the same free apps from my phone. Unlike the iphone/ipad where most of the same apps cost you money. This tablet also lets you completely customize it to your liking unlike most iproducts. Small enough to easily carry around with you but definitely big enough to do everything you need easier than on your smartphone. I haven't had any issues with lagging, it is fast and reliable. Runs great, screen is great, sound is great. I seriously have yet to find a flaw with this tablet at all. Granted, I'm not a high end techie either, but enough to know that this is definitely worth the price and a great product. I also bought this accessory bundle at the same time,CrazyOnDigital Purple Stand Leather Case with Charger and Screen Protector For Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 (6-item). Screen protector is wonderful, I prefer using it than to the actual screen itself, seems my finger glides over it easier. The case is great as well, plus the extra chargers are nice to have, especially the car charger. I definitely would recommend buying the two together, that way you have all the accessories you need. I really can't think of anything else to say except if you are debating over which tablet to get, stop and just get this one, you won't regret it!

tablet_galaxy_tab|We were really undecided on which tablet to buy. Amazon Prime price couldnt go wrong. Was very skeptical about 7" vice 10" but really impressed. So far Excellent product. DOES everything we expected and more. Very impressed. Will probably purchase another so we have his and hers. Only drawback is it is not a multi user friendly device. Once you register it with samsung.com, it is now essentially the person who owns the account, instead of most "windows" based where you can log in other users. Other than that, it is an awesome choice.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought one of these and even though I'm happy with the device in general I wouldn't buy another. The 7" version of the tab 2 has no video out even with an adapter and you need an adapter to connect a USB device. Other 7" tablets have both features.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I had a Kindle Fire and traded it in through Amazon to get the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. What an upgrade! The only issue I have is that you can't get many apps. You have to go through the Samsung Store on the tablet. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. It's not an iPad or even iPod but it's worth it if you want something to check your e-mail on, write papers and surf the web. You can also access your Kindle books through this device which was great surprise! I'd suggest this for someone wanting to try out a tablet that offers a little more then the Kindle.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this for my 9 year old grand daughter she is so happy. I am impressed with the ease of her figuring things out. Very very happy with my purchase.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this tablet for my niece and she loves it. Reasonable specs for the price. The micro sd port sealed the deal, other tablets of the same size do not have it, Nexus and Kindle. My niece wanted to copy music into her sd card and play it on the tablet, so it works for that just fine. The system works flawlessly for casual movie streaming (Netflix), viewing pictures, taking pictures, playing games, and reading ebooks. Im not saying its the best tablet out there, but for the price it is. Solid quality and easy to use.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Got this as a christmas surprise from my dad and it was amazing. The app store had pretty much everything I used on my iPod. So it rreplaced my old 2nd generation ipod touch with a bigger and better device!I highly recommend this to people looking to upgrade their old ipod touch without paying Apple's high costs!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Had 2 other cheaper tablets this year from xmas - a douple power 7 in tablet - crashed and returned to walmart and an HKC 7in tablet - defective and returned to Tiger Direct. those were both in the $130 range and were comparable hardware. This tablet, for another 60 bucks was light years better.Solid construction, smoother interface - everything works and the device has reputable support. Upgraded to android 4.1 no problem. Display is beautiful and screen resists smudges from greasy little kid fingers pretty well!if youre looking to cheap out on a tablet, you'll suffer like I did. Cough up a couple more bucks for this - well worth it and works really well.Only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is becuase it's not always easy to handle. It's a little slippery and you push the outside buttons accidentally sometimes. The soft keys make it easier to navigate than other tablets that have outside nav keys but the power and volume rocker are on the rim.Also, not crazy about the fact that Samsung uses some propritary power/data plug in like the Ipad/Iphone. Let's get away from all that and just use a standard power interface already!! I have a samsung infuse phone - wouldnt it have been great if they could share the cord?If you have other samsung devices, like phone and TV, they will pair up nice through some samsung apps. havnet tried it but its technically possible.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is the first tablet I have ever owned, so I'm not able to compare it to other brands. I've only had it for a few days, but I am so impressed with this tablet, I had to write a review. I'm impressed with the ease of use, and quality. Getting apps and widgets from various sites was a breeze. I'm anything but a tech wizard, but this was so easy to operate. I consider this a very user friendly tablet, and the features on it are fantastic. My friend has a Kindle Fire and he admits, this unit blows his away in alot of ways. Beautiful graphics, and the layout of functions will make it easy for anyone to operate.I couldn't be more pleased. I would highly reoommend this to anyone, you won't be disappointed.Update: Week 2 of ownership. Thought by now I would find some issues that I didn't care for, but I am more impressed the more I use it. I can't find one single thing I don't like.One of the quotes they advertise on Samsung's webpage is, 'I DIDN'T KNOW IT COULD DO THAT" and I'm finding that to be the absolute truth. If your looking for a smaller, easy to carry around tablet, look no further. A few family members have the Apple Ipad mini and we compared the two side by side and I could not tell any difference between the two, and being the Ipad is twice the price, why would anyone want the Ipad. The Samsung is amazing. Watched movies, TV shows, read books and searched the web flawlessly. Great graphic display and ease of use. I highly recommend it to anyone thinking about purchasing a smaller ( 7" ) tablet. You will love it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|What can I say its a Samsung!!!! I have yet to put it down...the graphics are awesoomeeee, the sound quality is great, the apps are coool, it connected fast and easy to my home wifi, and all my pictures, music, and files transfered easily from my samsung phone to it.. But the best part is that its ALL MINE!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is actually my first tablet. I have a samsung galaxy phone which I really like but playing apps on it got a bit hard on the eyes. I wanted something bigger but not too big. It came down to this, the kindle fire or googoe nexus. The real capper was that the nexus and fire do not have expandable sd card storage but the galaxy does, and up to 32 megabites. My music and pictures are all on sd so the choice was obvious! Other than that it has so many features and is very intuitive. I wish apps could be transrerred to sd card though but for general playing, surfing the web, email,taking pictures and movies, music (the dual speakers are pretty good too) this is excellent and a tremendous value. It does seem to kind of eat battery power a bit but maybe that's normal.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased one of these from another vendor which has no impact on this review. I got to know it and really loved it. It is a HUGE step up from the Kindle. I was never able to register it on the Samsung Web Site due to numerous bugs. I have the SD card and USB adapters which expand the capabilities greatly. The manual is very thorough and complete compared to most.All was well until 1/2013 when I turned it on and it stated that it needed to do an update. It gave no information as to what the update was, it just assured you that your data and settings would be saved. After about an hour it completed and rebooted. I didn't even recognize it. All my home screens were wiped clean and it's touch controls were a completely different layout. My apps were still there in the app drawer is all there was from my original setup. Searching the web, a number of people had stated that Samsung pushed an Android upgrade to 4.1.1 which did the same thing I experienced. Sure enough I was at a different version of Android, so tried emailing Samsung but there was a web site bug there too, you cannot find this model in the email form and cannot send if you don't. So I called Samsung Support to find out how to get the manual for this version as the one on their web site was for the version I purchased 2 months earlier. They said they don't have one and have no idea if one is coming but I would be emailed when it becomes available. How's that for customer support?!I don't mean there are a few cosmetic changes, EVERYTHING changed, browser, home screen layouts, where to find notifications and settings and now all the home screens were split. I had to search the web for tutorials on how to use 4.1.1. They are of some generic help pages, but every manufacturer tweaks Android a little. So good luck if you get hit by this upgrade. Samsung will not be there to help you in any way.Update 4/2013 - finally the manual which goes with this Android Upgrade pushed to these devices in 1/2013 is now available on the Samsung Web page/support for this model. When I contacted support at the time of the upgrade to ask about a new manual to go with this version, they said I would be notified when it came out. NOT. It says it was posted February 2013, which I know it was not. Maybe March. It brings to light a lot of the Samsung modifications/customizations made to 4.1.1.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Struggled for a long time between this and the pricey iPad. Since I had to buy 2 - I purchased one of each. My husband got the Samsung and my daughter got the iPad. They are both outstanding, my husband loves his Samsung...is still learning how to use all the features and is very happy with it. My daughter loves her iPad which has more features for her younger age group. Would purchase this Samsung again. Simple to use, nice graphics, colors, email, great for playing games and watching movies. Love it. Great buy!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This gift blew my friend and family away! Every time I see her, the tablet is with her. It was a welcome surprise and I don't know who uses it more, her teenagers or her! It pays to do thorough research on tablets and that's what was done by my friend as well as I and i know this is a home run!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Everyone told me the iPad was better, but I have been an Android fan since it came out, so I decided to try the Samsung. I'm not sorry. It is an all-around good alternative to a desktop or laptop computer if you don't want to do heavy lifting that needs a big screen or a complicated program. For reading a book, surfing the Internet or watching a video, it works great. There are plenty of useful apps for other purposes, too, so I would have no qualms about recommending it. My only concern, and it's the concern of about anyone who uses a tablet, is that I wish the battery charge lasted longer. Maybe technology will fix that.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This works great for a tablet or even as a back-up computer. I bought this to use when I send my computer in to the shop and so far I love it. It's quick, it has a quick response time, and the screen is really clear. It felt a little heavy at first, but now it feels incredibly light in weight. It has all the features of the Galaxy SIII without the pricey phone plan or awkward size because it's a tablet. I would highly recommend this to anyone thinking about a tablet because it is so flexible it what it can do and what it comes preset to do!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It comes with android 4.0 but just upgraded to 4.1.1 (jelly bean)Pros - easy to use, connect to wifi quickly.Cons - getting apps to SD card not very easy.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is awesome! I can't believe the price of this thing. It's the same price as the kindle fire and in my opinion much better. And it's half the price of the ipad and in my opinion much better. You can do so much more with an android than anything else. I've found that the smaller 7 inch size is much easier to use. The only complaint I would have is that they got rid of the options and search buttons that were next to the home button, depending on the app you're in the options button could be in a different place everytime. I don't understand why they would do that but I guess it's just something you have to get used to. One cool feature is that you can control your tv with it. I'm not sure why you would use it for that but it might come in handy.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great tablet more than I expected. Also a nice size not to big not to small, (may be a bit small for some people's needs)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Just received it 3 days ago, set it up with no hassels and it's ready to use. I like it so much better than the Nook I used before because it's fast. So far, so good.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this tablet. Bought it for my daughter,ended up getting one for myself. I can easily carry it in my purse.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|No problems with the unit itself. I wish I would have purchased the 10 inch version because I either have to enlarge the print or use my reading glasses what a pain. No instructions for use so you gotta purchase those seperately. The WI FI works great I have not tried watching a movie with Netflix or other vendors. Great for the price!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was an excellent experience. The stuff was expedited and arrived before promised, as requested to seller.The tablet looked like &#34;brand new&#34; conditions, with packaging indicating it was &#34;Manufacturer Refurbished in USA&#34;.The equipment performance is excellent as expected so far.This is a serious business doer, therefore I recommend.About the product itself, When you buy this tablet (or the 10-inch one), you will soon want to forget about your old laptop.The Operating System (ice cream sandwich) is very stable, the processor is fast and the overall performance is Excellent.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this tablet for my 14 year old son for Christmas. I purchased it mostly because it resembled my galaxy smartphone and figured it would be easy to set up for him and use. So far, it has been great. I have had no complaints from him about it so far....he spends most of his afternoon and weekends using it for movies, games and google searching. Now that he is back in school, I am sure it will help him with homework as well. I couldnt be happier.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|In general, I'm quite happy with it. Never wanted an iPad and my budget wouldn't allow for anything new. Didn't want a used one. I wasn't sure about a refurbished tablet. And I really wanted a 10&#34; screen. But, I'm pleasantly surprised. I have a netbook with a 10&#34; screen. My computer geek son assured me a refurbished item was a good one. I also researched tablets with Consumer Reports and this tablet was one of the top 3 for a 7&#34;.Pros: It's extremely light. The color is great. Worked right out of the box. Doesn't freeze. Easy to view e-reader. I use Nook, BTW, not the Kindle format. Connects anywhere I want as long as there is wi-fi. As far as screen size, the 7&#34; is fine.Cons: It didn't come with 8GB of storage. Not sure if that is because it's a refurb or not. I really needed to download and print out the manual from Samsung. It's not as intuitive as my Samsung phone (and after a year, I did get the manual for that as well so I could tweak my use of the phone). Having the manual helped with things like changing the home pages, widgets, apps, etc. Ten inch screen would have been better, particularly when using the keyboard. Go for it, folks. You will be happy.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Wow, my interaction with samsung tablet bring me everywhere at the touch of a finger. This tablet is easy to use and powerful.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love how this tab functions and flows. I love having access to the Amazon store as well as the Googleplay store.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i bought this as a present for my mother and after playing around with it, i was totally jealous and sooooo wish i bought one for myself also. great deal will recommend to anyone!!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Superb product design and functionality. Tells you when it is charging, screen design allows quick access to key applications, battery life excellent (using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi), thousands of applications available via Google Play Store. Skype works very well &#8211; receiving calls and doing video chat. I am using this with Logitech Bluetooth keyboard like a second computer. Best electronic device I have had in years. Job well done at Samsung!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The tablet is good for the price range. Most of the time the connection to the Internet is fast. The size is good; it fits in the palm of my hand easily. The app store includes a variety of apps, and they are easy to upload. The display is sharp and clear. Even though there are only two small speakers, the sound is good. Most of the time I use my headphones, so the small speakers is not an issue. The battery life is good- about six or seven hours. The customization of the tablet is good.I would recommend this tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I use this obsessively every day since I bought it about six months ago and carry it everywhere I go. Reading, watching shows, playing games, checking e-mail, video chatting, etc. There is nothing you can't do on this thing. Perfect size!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Pros - Android, size, screen,cons - speed, USB connection, battery life, power button in the wayRecieved this for Christmas and was very excited. The device looks great, feels great in your hands and since it is an android device it is easy to setup and use. All of the android apps I had on my phone downloaded automatically once I signed in with my google account. Movies, pictures and other apps look great on the tablet.I was very disappointed by the USB charging cable. At home I have 4 different cell phones, 3 kindles that all use the Universal USB charging adapter. I figured since this was an android it would be the same. Now I have to carry a different USB cable when I travel. Bummer. The speed of this tablet was awful until I turned off the predictive text on the keyboard. With that off the device flies. The battery life is OK but the screen sucks the battery down quickly when using the device as an e reader.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Own this for just over a week. Find it quite responsive, wi-fi works great. Display is fine. Adobe flash doesn't work on it but that's not Samsung's fault. HBOGO works well and so does my Optimum TVtogo app. Besides getting apps from Samsung's app store or Google Play I've downloaded Best Apps Market on my tab and have found a few apps that to me are worth having. Charges quite quickly but I've never been lower than about 50% so far on the battery and that's from downloading music and watching videos. Web pages load very quickly. All in all, worth the cost although I was lucky enough to get mine when Amazon was selling them for $173.00 which was the price Best Buy had them for just before Christmas.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my husband for Christmas. I did a lot of research before choosing this one and hoped it would live up to my expectations. So far I have been more than pleased! It connects quickly to the wi-fi and speedily moves through whatever application we tried. My husband typically pulls this out now instead of the laptop. I can't wait until the new-ness wears off for him and I can spend some time playing on it!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great little tablet! Did everything I hoped it would and more. Only wish I had waited a couple of weeks and paid less than I did in November.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My granddaughter LOVES it and she spent her Christmas day on it almost all day. Didn't have any problems at all.I had to wait because it was on back order, but the price was right, so I deceded it was worth the wait.Mahalo, TKato
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought 2 of these for my 4 and 7 year old grandchildren for Christmas. I was worried about the wear and tear a child would put on it but so far so good, it lives up to all the hype of a great tablet. I've found the iPad is too large and the iPad mini too expensive. The size and weight of the Samsung is perfect for their use, and fits easily into my purse. it is easy to use and there are many, many apps that can be installed. Now I wish Santa had brought one to me too! My only issue is that there aren't many choices for cases, I was looking for something unique and colorful.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I love this tablet. I would recommend this to everyone!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Got this for my 6yr old granddaughter and she loves it. there are so many learning apps available to her as well as ones for fun too! Its compact and great for the car as the battery life is long. Great price and delivery.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|my wife could not be any happier. best value for the product out there! now we will see how durable the product will be (meaning lifespan)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I read only excellent reviews about this mini tablet so I ordered two (one for myself and I gifted the other).Samsung products are 2nd to none when it comes to electronic devices. I highly recommend it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|awesome just awesome android 4,o is nice and ready to do everything you want and more why not be happy so many free bees yum yum happy kid again all over i think everyone whoo every had any and everything to do with android you people rule thank you very much
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is one awesome tab! I wont say I am an expert on these things. I have a Android smartphone I am pretty good at, and a Pandigital tablet that wont connect to Google Services, thats why I got this at an awesome price! WOW!!! So much better than the pandigital, and it was cheaper!!! I love it, its with me all the time now! I got it on Black Friday for $180, not sure what the $ is now, but it would be a steal at a much higher price. The remote control app is incredible!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this Android device for its price. It works well and has good speed compared to my old Android phone. Its easy to root and easy to use once you get used to it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The best tab on my opini&oacute;n, work fast great with wifi and love the remote control app. Using it with my 2 tv's.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This has got to be the best tablet on the market, sorry Amazon, but it blows your Kindle Fire out of the water! I have a Kindle Fire, and purchased the Samsung Galaxy for my parents and I was amazed at the differences! The camera and video a decent, it is light weight, not bulky to hold in your hand, it comes with google play, same andriod market I use on my cell phone, and you can still use it as a reader with the kindle app! Plus it has a sd slot for expanded memory.I liked it so much I got both my kids one for Christmas, and talked 2 of my friends into doing the same for their kids! The kids were so excited, and have been playing with them non stop! My kids are 9 and 5 and I was a little concerned about them having access to the andriod app market and internet without any controls, but after a google search I found app lock, a free app that allows you to lock any app with a password! Now when they want to go on youtube, or download a game they have to come to me first! Sorry to compare to the Kindle Fire, but their app market just doesn't hold up to googles! It's funny though, the kids call their tablets Kindle Fires, because I have one, so maybe it's not so bad for Amazon.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|the tablet is a perfect product for my needs. it has all the features that i wanted. it is very light and battery lasts for along time. i paid $179 and for the price, i got the best deal. i talked to a best buy sales person before i ordered online and he highly recommended the samsung galaxy tab 2 over all the 7 inch tablets in the store.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought 3 tablets before deciding to keep this one. It's perfect. Not too big or too small. Can download apps from Samsung AND Google Playstore. Comes with Kindle app preinstalled, if you download the Nook app from the Playstore you'll have the best of all 3 world's (Kindle, Nook, and Android). What more can you ask for?Recommend to JWs that want to use EPUBS (with Nook app) for meetings. Same size as NWT, so easy to use without distracting others.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bright display, good for older eyes. Still getting used to it, need more time to use it to really comment intelligently.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Samsung has built another winner in the Galaxy Tab 2. The Galaxy Tab 2 takes its place alongside many other excellent Samsung products we've purchased in recent years. The quality and performance values are solid, and all the equipment - ranging from cell phones to HD televisions and HD monitors, to tablets - is all returning nicely on our investments. Can't recommend them enough!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My wife wanted something bigger than a phone size that would fit in her purse. This fit the bill. She needed something a little bigger so she could use a bigger font but didn't want a large tablet. This is the perfect fit.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Mom asked for this specifically for Christmas because of the size. It's perfect it fits in a purse/large pocket no problem. The battery has been working well so far. Given mom doesn't have a smart phone or a laptop this is perfect. She can check her email, take photos, and download apps. Perfect without the cost of another smart phone on the data plan, we just use the house hold wireless.Highly recommend it for parents/kids that you don't want using your phone or laptop.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought one for my daughter as a gift. My son bough me one as a gift..I love it! It is easy to use..its fast..and it is the perfect size for me. I thought the 7inch would be to small but I am able to stick it in my purse and be on my way.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|All functionality it's smooth, high resolution clear screen, fast, all around great... For all that you cann do with this 7 incher compared to others, it is a no brainer; front and regular cam, blutooth synchronization, expandable to 32gb mini sd... Love this new toy!Touch screen is mostly accurate, every once in a while just a hair off and hard to find cases I like (but that's not the tablets fault)...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was best gift I received for Christmas! I had a apple iPad2 and of course apple products are just simply user friendly. But I get the same results on the android and it's smaller. I wanted a smaller tablet that could fit in my purse. I was looking at the mini ipad and still was not pleased. The samsung was the seller since the SD slot is a added bonus and I can bump my MB . It's quick, I can browse sites that require flash.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this tablet for my son for Christmas being that both my husband and I own IPADs. This tablet can do so much and my son loves it. I find it to be more versatile where downloading apps are concerned. I am happy that he is happy. Product was as discribed and arrived before christmas. No complaints
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love it!Its not probably the best like other tablets, or maybe it is! I really love it! I can do everything on here for my school and other things. Easy to carry around with, instead of my big laptop. I especially love that you can watch movies or shows and transfer it to my big screen tv.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is amazing. I bought it for my 11 yr old daughter. It is really fast, great size for her to carry around. Very light and overall great. I have a Ipad, and my daughter who is 17 has a kindle fire and this tablet is right up there with the IPAD and less $ so even better. Amazing product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love this thing. Extremely flexible in terms of all the things that it can do. eBook reader, check email without breaking out the laptop, mini-presentations, etc. I actually leave the laptop at the office sometimes now.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got the Samsung galaxy tab 2 for Christmas after I mentioned I wanted a book reader. I read some of the reviews and I didn't know at first if this was right for me, but I can't complain. So far I've downloaded apps that I had on my iPod touch and transferred my books over. I just finished adding some music and pics and this thing is working great. Its small enough to put in my purse and travel with it. It's not too heavy that I get tired of holding it when I'm reading. It connected to my computer and all is in order. This is my first tablet and I'm happy with it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this for the girlfriend, she loves it! Battery power seems to be around 6-7 hours, graphics look decent and processing speed is expected for its hardware. I think it was worth the price, and the expandable memory is always a plus.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Awesome unit for my 14yr. old son, he uses it for school and everything in between, loves the android apps
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my son for Christmas, and he was elated. Turns out it does a lot of neat stuff that we didn't realize. He has an x-box and you can use this as a remote control device for that... I bought the refurbished model, and it was in perfect working order with all literature and packaging.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was told that this product has some cosmetic wear on it and thats what I expected when I got it....but there was none and so this is why it get 5 stars.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Excellent tablet! good web navigation and wifi works perfect, thoroughly recommended. excellent battery life.The back cam really surprised me
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this tablet for my knefew and she loves it, i am thinking buy one for me...... . .
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really love this tablet! After so much research and talking to a friend who owns one, I decided to purchase this for a special holiday price. I am very pleased with the performance and ease of access to the applications. I love the screen and it is easy to go from app to app, download your own and find the different function locations. I am so glad I chose this instead of buying a Mini IPad.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Having so much fun exploring what it will do...Granddaughter likes it a bunch too! Best way to start with tablet for a very reasonable price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7" tablet for my son as a gift. He was always using my iPad or our Acer Iconia Tab, so I fet it was time for him to have his own. It is a really awesome little device. I actually want one for myself! It is small enough that you can carry it around without adding much bulk or weight to your purse or backpack... but the screen is really great quality to watch movies and play games!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I just picked up this tablet at Best Buy. My old iPad (1st gen) is sorely out of date and I really needed an update. I've owned Android phones in the past and hated them (they were crappy phones), and it's made me leery of Android ever since. I've had a BlackBerry, and iPhone 4, and an HTC Radar (windows phone), so I'm pretty picky about what I want in a device.I went to Best Buy thinking I was going to end up having to choose either a really cheap eReader or spring for Kindle Fire HD or Nook HD. Neither seemed as robust as I wanted. I ended up playing with a few Android tablets and didn't hate them. Then I came across the Tab 2 7".It is extremely responsive. No lag time whatsoever. Excellent setup options and this has a great way for my to manage my RAM usage. I love the expandable SD slot, and the Play market is a far cry better than the old Android Market I was in before. The screen display is crisp and clear. I didn't even mind the 7" size. My iPad gets heavy after a while, and I had been considering upgrading to the iPad Mini. I work as Apple iOS tech support, so I was strongly swayed to choose a product I could troubleshoot and maintain myself. Once I had the Tab 2 in my hands, though, it was love.I was so enamoured with this device I actually managed to convince 3 others into buying it as well. And it was a steal for only 179 plus tax.If you want something small but robust, clean, sharp, clear and tidy, this is the tablet for you. I can sync my OneNote books from my Win 8 laptop, I can sync my Gmail, sync my Facebook contacts and so much more, and I haven't had to pay extra for the apps I love and haven't had to spend 6 hours trying to figure out how to make it work.And if 7 inches is too small, try the Tab 2 10.1 inch tablet :)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love my tablet especially when I don't feel like getting on my laptop! I can do almost everything on here that I can do on my computer. Great Battery life, great size. The only con is I wish it had swipe for the keyboard. But it still gets a 5 star in my book!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|im very pleased with this product, except the issue with the wifi (poor signal reception) and you cant have 8 Gb of space because the apps will be installed directly to the internal memory, so, if you want to install a lot of apps please be aware that the 8 Gb will be a limit, even if you buy an external memory (apps wont be installed on it)Other than that, im very pleased with the free apps that i installed, Acad viewer, Evernote, Droppbox (free one year), and office. Its excelent for my proffesion, i can inspect buildings, see the cad files, take pictures, make notes, and use word, excel and power point, sync files and review them in my house.Maybe with an upgrade that problem can be solved. =)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Everything is pretty awesome about this tablet. I'm thinking about buying two more next year. I recommend this product. Grettings from venezuela
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|this tablet is everything I hoped and expected it to be. I love it. It has huge memory And a beautiful picture. I'm typing this review on it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|All Perfect. Good Quality.Very happy this this product. It sutted fine and its a proper item wich i recomment for all users.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a stylish, elegant, easy for handling, multifunctional device. On the other hand I love SAMSUNG products. They are always reliable and comprihansive. It makes your life easier.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Excelente producto recomendado.. lo recomiendo! funciona excelente y llego a tiempo, excelente envoltura y tal cual lo describio el vendedor
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I received it earlier than expected and it looked like new!(It was a refurbished one) now my wife wants one.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am very happy with my Samsung Tablet 2(7.0) It is just as described, like new. I use it daily as my Bible on the go and at church , but I also listen to music and watch shows on Utube and Hulu, the sound is fantastic, it is fast, clean, arrived on time and user friendly. The price made it a fantastic buy, one of my best purchases on Amazon. Thanks.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this to replace my Galaxy Player 5, but after receiving it, I found that I could not move apps to the SD card. I have several programs that require the SD card. I have put the tab 7 on the shelf for now, in hopes that they come out with a fix.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I would definitely recommend this over a Kindle Fire. It does more than the fire, has the google play store, cameras for video chat, can be expanded with a microsd card. The only downside I have found so far is that there are not a ton of good accessories like cases out there for it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|There are no words that can truely descibe the felling of owning this tab. It was worth paying the extra $50. for the additional features which makes it a step above the Kindle Fire. Love Love Love.Having both a front facing and rear camera makes it eay for both picture taking and Skpye conversations. The size is just right as it can fit into any bag and its light weight feature makes it great for travelling. Battery power is exceptional and you can not only read but watch movies etc. It's the better buy for anyone who is looking for an eReader but would also like the added features of Web access. It is also a great option over getting a bulky laptop which not only cost more but is also much heavier.Great buy for travellers/busy moms/business owners.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Received the tablet two days ago, like it very much, it is very fast, works well. The only problem I have is switching the language from English to Russian. You cannot select two languages and use them simultaneously, you either type your message in Russian or in English. As far as I understand this is the Adnroid 4 problem - you cannot switch the language using the virtual keyboard, there is no special button (if I'm not mistaken there were few ways previously, including sliding on the space button etc), so everytime I have to go to preferences and switch it there; it is quite irritating.PS In few days I found the way to select few languages, it is quite deeply hidden in keyboard preferences, so now I have a special button on it to switch from English to Russian. But as far as I understand, many users could face the same problem, so maybe there should be some clarification from the Android developers regarding this.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This has replaced my laptop for most of my casual web surfing, news reading, and e-book reading. You can get e-books from Amazon. I also found out my little local library is linked with a bunch of others and that together they offer quite a selection of books to check out.Video playback is also excellent.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great Tab !! Great Resolution and sound.. on the Top latest of Android version...Not very bulky and same time not thin.. Initially I was doubtful on screen size but when I used, i found it very satisfactory.Front camera is okay but rear has very good result. Connects to Wifi easily.. though notice sometime buffering while playing video ...possibly my internet connection!! Finally..bought it for my Wife and she loves it...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung works exceptionally well right out of the box - excellent interface for one who is"senior" and not yet adept away from a desktop (don't use a cell phone either). Does appreciably better with a very strong wifi signal - relevant in my 100 year old home; had to upgrade my in-house network - but the tablet is excellent.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this tablet three weeks ago as a replacement for a netbook and so for it has been an amazing product, for what I use it for and taking it back and forth to work with me to have on breaks is perfect. Size wise it is great for the price, easy to take with were you need it and you dont have to get one of those pesky plans or data like with verizon or sprint, since it is wifi only you have to be in a wifi area to get internet on it but it is still not a bad product. The only thing I would say is a down is the camera is low megapixel, other wise great device over all and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced tablet
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Excelent for me and my kids. I got a galaxy phone and I prefere android devises. Very easy to use
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|havent had it for too long but i can tell you its a billion times better then I even expected. clear picture, great features, Super easy to use! I have used the kindle fires and almost bought one but this tablet is so much better.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love my galaxy tab - so much that my poor laptop sits unused most of the time now. It's perfect for reading books, reading email, surfing the internet and even for gps. At this price, you really can't go wrong (except now Google has a Nexus tablet out for less money and more power that I would probably buy). The screen is nice and sharp and as long as I keep it in a case, it looks like a nice expensive tablet (because the back is kinda plasticky looking). The dual core processor on this means it is plenty snappy for everyday use - I haven't seen any slowdowns or hang ups since I got it. Now, if only samsung would push the Jelly Bean update like they said they would...

tablet_galaxy_tab|El samsung galaxy, excelente precio, cumple con todo lo ofrecido por el vendedor, sorprendente la rapidez del envio, le recomiendo

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought one of these 3 days ago and could never get it to connect to my network. Support chats and phone support could not resolve the issue. I was told I had a unit w a faulty network adapter and to send it in for service or return it. I returned it and picked up a new unit yesterday. Same issue. Same lack of success w support.I do not like to quit, so I kept at it.Here is what resolved it for me. I went into my routers settings and manually added the tab to the wireless card access list and voila it connects.I called support to advise them of the solution so they can assist others and update their troubleshooting procedures.Hope this helps someone here as well.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've used an iPad for work, and while it's impressive, it doesn't really do anything special my iPhone can't do, so I returned it.Thought, well I really want a smaller tablet, so I went with the Acer Iconia 7" which was a decent tablet, but the screen malfunctioned after six months with it, so I took it in to Best Buy where I had a protection plan under it and traded it for other goods instead.I recently bought this for mother on Black Friday, and have already programmed it to all the televisions/cable boxes in my house. That feature alone is so great! Sort of makes you feel like, wow, we're finally in 2012 a bit with home tech ;)Other than that, the camera on it is nice for a tablet of this price, and its running on Android 4.0, which is pretty sleek. Visually this tablet isn't stunning, but its sturdy. The keyboard is a perfect size for normal typing, and the android market has everything you need in terms of apps.Love this tablet, will edit my review if it doesn't last long, but so far, everything is great.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Would actually like to give it a 4 1/2. It arrived in great time and is easy to use, especially since I already have an android phone. I leave it in the family room and use it to get online and read books. I added Drop Box which transfers files easily from my lap top so I can take them with me. Only thing is I wish it had a usb port. It does connect to my computer with the usb in the charge cord, but it doesn't have a separate usb port to attach a thumb drive. Not necessarily a deal breaker, but if it had one it would get a 5
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great product. I bought it for my 6 year old and she loves it! It is fast and easy to use. Has lots of storage for her ebooks and games. I would recommend it for any age.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Works like a dream, and the 7 inch one is a perfect size for e-books, email, and basic web searching. The touch screen is very reactive and supports multi-touch. It fits nicely into a generic 7-inch e-reader/tablet case that i piicked up at biglots. I much prefer this over the ipad/2.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of my laptop, but it's good for what I bought it for - which is surfing the web and watching videos.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|So far, it has been an excellent tablet. The only recommendation is to turnon the power saver mode. Without it, the battery does run down a little fast.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|it's sort of like my mobile phone is on steroids, but without the phone part. I love this device. I travel a lot and enjoy reading the news and playing my games. Device is fast and screen quality is great. Picks up wi-fi almost everyplace and when I power on again it finds the same signal. More apps than I could ever use. All the old favorites and tons of new apps I never heard of. Two thumbs up from me. Well worth the money !
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was looking to upgrade my Kindle Keyboard (purchased in 2011) to a Kindle Fire HD for an upcoming trip to Europe when I read some promising reviews for the Galaxy Tab 2. For me, this is a secondary media device- I run my laptop as a media center hooked to my HDTV and wanted to be able to Skype and surf the internet from the comfort of my bed, without resorting to using my iPhone, or having to unplug my computer and bring it to the bed. Being able to run games or movies AND connect with my friends around the world.I am still toying with and learning about the Tab 2, but so far it has been everything I wanted. I haven't abandoned my Kindle, but I enjoy being able to see color images from books and comics. Honestly I still prefer the e-ink format for prolonged reading, and the backlight (as expected) lessens battery time.Connectivity via GPS, wifi, and Bluetooth are all very stable. Android is a comfortable and easy to learn OS, Icecream Sandwich seems incredibly stable, and customization is elegant. Unfortunately the IR/Remote function does not work for me just yet, but I will experiment and work on it further- this was a novelty to me, and not key.Networking in order to access files on my PC from my tablet is my next project.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Android 4.0 was a plus for Galaxy Tab 2 Right out of the box. It has responded well with every App that I have used. The display/video quality Is great. Very affordable tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was a Christmas gift for my boyfriend he already started using it. And he loves it, glad he likes it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great device in every way with shortcomings only on device memory and screen size. Its light weight makes you just wanna carry it wherever you go.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I don't care of IPAD mini at all!!! Great price, awsome apps, no limits for downloads or installations, great screen resolution, good size.....it works more than perfectly believe me
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Took a chance and ordered my wife a Galaxy Tab 2 from amazon for christmas and it came Fast and in perfect condition!! Would recommend it to everyone!! Thanks and great job amazon!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Where to start. Well i bought this tablet on black Friday and i love it. i did buy it from best buy so mine is the white version but other than that the exact same thing. i love how fast this tablet operates. it is snappy and very responsive. the camera may not be high mp but it shoots great video and photos. and the front camera is great for Skype conversations. the built in IR blaster is well AMAZING. what is better than being able to surf the web and play games on a device that can change your tv channel and volume at the same time. i have yet to find a flaw in this device and love to use it for everything i do. i got this to replace carrying around my 17" laptop all the time
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Have had my tablet for a week now and have to say that it is exactly what I needed.I can use my favorite Android app to read my e-books in bed. The calendaring system works seamlessly with my Google calendar, but also gives me the option to store a calendar locally (something I wanted). I can check any email account via IMAP, text via Google Voice, listen to music, set an alarm to wake me up. The &#34;smart alarm&#34; feature is really cool...The camera has no flash, but I didn't really buy this for the camera. It also doesn't seem to have a microphone, but I could be wrong about that. I'll update when I figure that out, but I never use voice commands anyway.Anyway, reading e-books on this tablet is a real joy. I use the Aldiko Android app for reading all my epub ebooks. It has the wonderful day/night feature and allows you to adjust the brightness, something I could never do with my phone.The tablet doesn't appear to be available on Amazon anymore, and I happened to catch it on sale for $199 before it went out of stock, but if you can find this product elsewhere, I highly recommend it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have both this and an iPad 3. This I love for 2 reasons. The first is because it will take expandable memory. The second is because it is smaller but not too small. Works just as good as the iPad 3 and easier to carry around. I love this thing. I got it for my birthday this year and have had nothing but good luck in the 3 months that I've had it. Not a single problem. My Buddy that bought it for me already had one and he too has not had a single problem. We both love this little thing. I would so much prefer buying this for someone over a Kindle Fire any day.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this tablet and i am so pleased, it is very light weight, fits in my back pocket,screen is unreal, is very clear on every thing is and it is very fast, and the sound is very loud, anyone buying this tablet will be very very pleased and impressed
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this to replace my Kindle Fire which I was hacking and updating almost every week so I could have an inexpensive and small tablet with plain Android 4.0. Having the front and rear cameras is nice when you want to have a video chat or take a quick pic of something to Google Goggle. Bluetooth works really well for tethering and uses a lot less power than WiFi tethering on both the devices involved. The TV remote app is a good idea but does not work with all devices and cannot be used like a plain old universal remote (you are locked in to using it as a guide). As usual Touchwiz and all the other Samsung crapware ruins the device and slows it down. It also has a proprietary iPod like connector instead of the a standard micro USB connector like the majority of other devices in the world. Samsung if you insist on including a useless dock connector at least add a micro USB connector as well. I will probably end up selling this tablet and getting a Google Nexus 7" tablet if/when they release one so I don't have crappy software customization and get updates in a reasonable amount of time.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had this tablet now for a week, and I must say that I am completely in love with it. It's small, and easily transportable, but provides a bigger screen than my smartphone, and makes interacting with Google Play apps much much easier. The apps themselves run extremely smoothly, with no apparent form of lag. The interface ICS provides is sleek, smooth, and rarely bogs down from background apps. I love the ability to jump from one app to the next simply with a push of an on-screen button, and how easy it is to close a background app with a swipe of a finger.The battery life on this tablet is amazing. It lasts much longer than my laptop every did, even running apps continuously. I leave it on overnight sometimes; when I wake up, I am pleased to see the batter has only been reduced by 2-3%!Setting up all my email accounts was a breeze. It basically walked me right through it. Calendar synced up with my hotmail account too.I love this tablet; perfect size, perfect speed, perfect interface, perfect price! If you're looking for a tablet to provide you an awesome intermediate between your smartphone and your PC, this is definitely a great buy. I couldn't be happier with this tablet!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great and good looking product it is almost a laptop and you can do lot of things with it (Play, manage your office documents, email, and many other good things), it can be used as home user as can be used for business user, i truly recommend it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Android 4.0, wifi only, micro sd card slot, does everything i wanted it to do. While it does lack the Amoled display Samsung is infamous for, it still doesn't take away from this. I wanted something bigger than my Samsung Galaxy S2 phone and couldn't get the Galaxy Nexus just yet but this satisfied my cravings.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this Tablet for my wife for Mothers Day, and I got me one too, My wife loves it; we are able to do so much with this tiny device. The Galaxy is very responsive and so far no major problems.After seeing the Galaxy in person, this was the only Tablet I wanted. My wife would have settled for another but after receiving her Samsung Galaxy 2 7" Tablet I would literary have to pry it from her hands. I would recommend this product very much. You will not be disappointed!!!Also with the ability to add extra memory (micro SD) was the deal breaker for me. If you cannot upgrade your memory what is the point. You can load up a add-on sd card so you never run out of content to keep you entertained. And the battery life helped in my decision 7.5 hours......Good enough for me..Hope this helps!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've had this thing a few days and i love it. It's Android, so the overall experience is a lot like a larger version of my familiar smart phone.Pros: Smooth, stable, multitasks, adjusts brightness to ambient lighting, good wi-fi. Full Ice Cream Sandwich in a similar price range to the more limited e-readers.Cons: Battery takes too long to recharge. No Hulu plus for this device yet. (Netflix works fine, though).For the $250 i paid for it, this is a nice device.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This table is the best, because it helped me in my work, at university, and the best thing is its size, weight, fits in anywhere. I recommend it 100%
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I ordered my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 product on Sunday and received Tuesday evening! Great service Amazon! I read many...many reviews on line before purchasing and I believe this was a very smart buy. I showed a couple of folks at work today and they want to buy one also. Very attractive looking, lightweight and easy to hold for a long period of time. Love my purchase! I have a Samsung Infusion phone which I love also. Samsung makes great looking products!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've owned this tablet for three weeks now, and I love it. Getting started was tricky though. It took TWO factory resets to get it where it needed to be. The first reset was because the camera wouldn't work and I'd have no picture when viewing netflix. I waited almost two weeks to plug the tablet into my computer and then the driver wouldn't install (I use Vista) so I did a second factory reset. After this, the driver installed fine and now I LOVE my tablet. It took a little patience out of the gate, but it's working GREAT now.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was a wonderful gift for my 7 year old. The price is great too. I looked at a lot of places and this was the most cost efficient. This is easy to work and easy to hold for my daughter. She loves it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was a great buy, I ordered it as a birthday gift and my boyfriend loves it. hasn't put it down sine he got it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I had the Galaxy Tab 2 for about one week. Already very satisfied. Don't know why it doesn't come with manual for operation butyou can find what you need to know on the internet. Speakers for the music is exceptional!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I recommed these product good quality, came in good conditions, have a slow price and the tablet is easy to use.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I thought it would awesome and be able to do so much more than it does. I am not able to use my prime account to stream movies to it because it requires adobe flash player. Before I purchased I was stuck between an amazon fire HD and this, and I thought this would be more effective for business and pleasure. it is not, I should have gone with the fire.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|for my 3 yr old we replaced her ipod with this Samsung tab and it works well, this is something that can grow with her in the future. And we can add a keyboard later, to make it into a netbook...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this product for my 13 year old daughter . She loves it . It is a really nice product
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I recommend it. It is exactly as published. I arrive at the stipulated time. Good product. Greetings from M&eacute;rida - Venezuela

tablet_galaxy_tab|PRODUCTO IMPECABLE.. ENVIO RAPIDO, 100% RECOMENDADO, GENTE SERIA. LO RECOMIENDO AMPLIAMENTE PARA HACER NEGOCIOS. SON UNA MARAVILLA DE VENDEDORES. PRODUCTO SELLADOS
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I chose the Galaxy Tab because it had a higher resolution screen than most other devices at this price point. Overall I am very pleased with the screen and its touch sensitivity. The device performs well for all games and apps that I have downloaded. My only issue is the Samsung port. There does not appear to be an adapter available to send video out. No hdmi, vga or digital out. So, if you're planning to buy it for that purpose, you may want to look at other devices.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Hello World! I'm from Costa Rica (Pura Vida!) and I'm really impressed with this tablet and the delivering time. I bought it on Mondays night and arrived on Friday morning to Costa Rica. It's lighter and thiner than the kindle fire (just more expensive, but worth it) and the screen size is perfect. Unfortunately, this Tablet has no sim card slot, but I'm very happy with my purchase.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I just want to say that I am VERY happy with my Galaxy Tab 7 2! The size is perfect because I can put it in my inside coat pocket. I see others carrying their iPads on their shoulders and I feel sorry for them. The Tab is half the price and has all of the capabilities of the iPad.Overall, I couldn't be happier.For the money you can't go wrong with the 7 2.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Galaxy 2 is a nice 7" ICS Tab for a great price! The memory slot, 2 cameras, full Android 4.0 ICS, Bluetooth, and GPS are well worth the extra $50 compared to the Kindle Fire. This Tab does a great job serving its purpose of watching Netflix/YouTube/Amazon Prime videos, reading, email, and casual/quick Web browsing. Price was #1 when choosing this Tab, sure there are better/faster Tabs but I really didn't want to spend much more than $200. BTW - No problems connecting this Tab to my rooted Moto Photon 4g using Wifi Tethering. Much nicer to watch videos/movies anywhere on the crisp 7" screen compared to my Photon screen.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is the best android device I have ever used.. Sandwich is awesome and apps on it really work cool. Performance is good and touch interface is fantastic. Overall excellent device for the price where you can do all your stuff which you can perform on you computer.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great item, I've been playing with this for a few days now. Trying to set things up. Browsing and all applications seem to work very well and are pretty fast. Just where did my contacts go? I can't find them. I have also an Android phone, an Ipad 2 and I'm using the same Google account but I haven't found the contacts button yet on this device. Is it the new Android system or is Samsung hiding it somewhere? But besides this all is well :-)Addendum -- One thing I don't like so much but that's not a Samsung Tab 2 issue rather an Android ICS issue is the use of MTP instead of the USB mass storage protocol. IMHO Android ISC should give us an option as to what to use:-(
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tab and i love it with the exception that the browser force closes often. Downloaded Dolphin hd and that does it as well. Anybody else experience this and know of a fix?
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Right off the bat this tab is fast and very reponsive.The battery life ia very respectable and the screen isGorgeous, I don't have any complaints at all.ProsPriceCpu speed fastContent lotsGreat support i chatted with samsung supportAbout flash and was helped immediately.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Pity we didnt think about get a 3G version. Very versatile utility. I share the device with my 5 year old son and he seems ahead of me.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Was pleasantly surprised by this. The display isn't perfect but the speed and responsiveness exceeded my expectations at this price point.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchase this for my daughter, and she is having a ball with it, she does her school work on it. She love the size because it fit right in her purse. and yer i'll recommend it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Using it now as it type, even though its refurbished no problems. Plays music surf the internet. Read books etc. No problems found.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I wanted an e-reader and could not decide between the Kindle or Nook or the Samsung Tablet. After looking at all the specs of each, I went with this one and couldn't of be any happier. I love it and use it everyday. The battery life is great! I read, play games and surf the internet. The only thing that I do not like about it is that it does not support flash but overall well worth the purchase.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great for a little workstation in your hotel room. I hooked it up with this: Motorola Wireless Keyboard with Trackpad - Retail Packaging by Motorola -see my review there.Experienced no performance issues. $202.98 at Walmart. Pricier here. Will never replace your desktop, but maybe so? since we've all got to be on the go.This will keep up and has great utility.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i thought i had to have an ipad! i wanted to try this first! i have an i-phone and this is waaaaaay better! I AM SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS! MY DAUGHTER THOUGHT SHE HAD TO HAVE A MAC BOOK, now she wants this instead!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|For its price, this product makes a good tablet to own if you have never had one. It is light weight comparing to iPad which makes it good to take on the road. The response time is quick and the screen resolution is all right.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Liked Samsungs extras as much as Googles. Smooth browser saves pages or pics of pages for offline and with gPlay just add Pocket app to auto download and save all for offline reading. Efficient with good set of apps already loaded. Not as happy with capacitive screen while it's great for most actions using fingers or &#34; wide stylus I draw and freehand sketch notes a lot and line crontrol is frustrating.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I would say this is the perfect tablet and one of the best of all the Andriod tablets. When we compare it to Google Nexus 7(Asus)The basic advantage of this one is we can add additional memory when we need it i.e. add sdcard; on the either side the little backlogs are it has ICS, little smaller screen.Good product at such a price :)

tablet_galaxy_tab|the charger was broken when I got it! Tried using the usb portion from my Samsung Galaxy S2's charger with the charging cable that came with the tablet...looked like it was working at first...but, after playing on the tablet for a bit, I noticed that the battery wasn't charging at all! :(The tablet itself is in great condition and runs great!Its a gift for my son and I gave it to him today as an early Christmas present. he absolutely loves it!*edit*Contacted the seller shortly after writing this review. They got back to me very quickly and said they would send a replacement charger!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this Samsung Tablet. It has clear sound and great screen resolution. This is my first Tablet and I wanted something affordable yet with good reviews. I have found it easy to use and logically set up. I am traveling next month to visit my out of state daughter and didn&#8217;t want to lug my lap top with me. The first time on the Tablet I was able to access my email without any problems and that was my main concern. I am looking forward to puting my music and pictures on it while using the apps. This tablet is something that I can grow into without it being out of date in a few months.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|We bought this for the sole purpose of using our microsd card for showing/viewing pictures right out of our camera. The picture quality is great and easy to share pictures or even show friends and family. I need to figure out how to upload the videos, because none of our videos uploaded on the tablet. We mainly use this for pictures, internet, netflix, youtube and facebook. We don't plan on uploading tons of apps so the internal memory being 8gb isn't a big deal for us. Ultimately it's a smaller tablet for reading, so I can't expect it to do it all. Overall we are happy with out samsung galaxy purchase.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I like the tablet but I was expecting a better quality with the screen. I originally bought the tablet in order to use while I travel to and from work. I was hoping to be able to play games and read books but unfortunately I am not able to do any of them. Once I turn on the tablet, I see more of myself and my background than what is actually being displayed on the screen. When I try to do anything on the tablet I get an eye and headache. This is so annoying as it defeats the purpose of the tablet.I am hoping I can locate an anti-glare screen protector for it. I really dont want to have to buy such small item online as the shipping cost to my location would not make this feasibleI think it is a user-friendly tablet as I haven't as much as browsed through the manual and I am able to get by with it.I gave it 3 stars because of the physical pain experienced when using this device. I do wish the manufacturer will fix this issue though.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Having used this product for 3 months in and around the house as well as shopping centers in this country and overseas, I find the wifi reception to be extremely poor and insensitive. Takes forever to hookup and looses strength just moving a few feet. If you don't need wifi, this is a fine product. However if you are like me who uses it primarily for wifi to replace my heavy laptop, then you'll be disappointed. If it had a good wifi reception, I would've rated it a 5-star.

tablet_galaxy_tab|creo que es una de mis mejores compras, me da muchisismas horas de entretenimiento y adem&aacute;s la puedo llevar a todos lados. me ayuda en mi trabajo tambien.

tablet_galaxy_tab|love it, love it, love it i use this tablet every day. no problems at all. The delivery time was excellent and the product was as advertised, and in excellent condition. i would recommend this product and companychuckr

tablet_galaxy_tab|Short story with a happy ending ... got the Samsung Tablet. Fiddled with it. Battery ran low. Plugged it in for charging. Product never turned back on. I was pissed (at Samsung and Amazon)!! Went to the web to figure out how to return it. (had already decided i would never order electronics from Amazon again).Found out the the return policy and process was a breeze! Amazon even shipped me a new device before i had even gotten to the UPS store to send of the defective device! Got the new Samsung tablet. Love it! (actually, the Samsung tablet is for my young son (10 years old), but he loves it too!) And i love Amazon for making the return process simple and efficient.So ... Five stars for everyone!BTW - I also recently got an IPad2 for myself. Gotta say that I love it too! But for the price, this 7&#34; Galaxy tab is an even better deal if you ask me!

tablet_galaxy_tab|Es super excelente, comoda, practica y super hermosa......Ademas super rapida...... excelente conexion con internet y buenas aplicaciones ... felicidades samsung
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was surprised how nice this tablet was and how vivid the screen looked when I turned it on. So far this product has exceeded my expectations.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|After comparing the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 to the IPPad Mini at retail stores, I decided that the Galaxy was a better purchase for me. On sale, it is half of the price of the IPad and, except for maybe a better picture quality on the IPad, is an excellent product. I did have a bit of trouble with the volume on apps going silent, but the matter was easily settled by going online for support. (It was just a setting that got &#34;goofed up&#34;. In fact, I liked the Samsung Galaxy Tab so much that I purchased a second one-this time for my husband. I would advise anyone who purchases one to get the extra memory. Also, battery time does not last like it is stated to do, but with some setting changes, and complete &#34;power offs&#34; when not actively being used, lasts sufficiently.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great tablet for the price. upgraded to android 4.1 the day I recived it. Got it for my wife and she seems to like it alot. Shes not a huge fan of tablets but she like the ease of use on this one. the functionality of it. She does facbook and netflix and has been running solid from day one.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had a Kindle eBook reader, given to my wife 3years ago, still working great. This old one never displays any ads on the screen. I heard the new ones display ads !!!I also had a 10.2" tablet running Android 2.2 that I used as an eBook reader, this is an el cheapo from China, works well for what's is designed for but SLOW and only 3 hours battery life. But I never had ANY issue with this one for the last 3 years. Still running very solid. It just did not have WIFI. Internet cable is OK and allowed me to browse the Internet.So, I decided to buy this tablet, small, long battery life and very easy to operate. Everything is smooth on this one.I search for a free PDF reader, download it and now I can read all my books in PDF formats.Actually, I took the microSD memory from the 10.2" tablet above and stick into this new tablet. It sees all my books right away.Connecting to WIFI is no brainer, I get into the Web within 5 mins using it.Pinching to zoom is a nice feature to have. (all iPhones had this feature).The protective pouch is also supplied as well as the charger. The pouch is a it too tight, sliding the tablet in it is not too difficult, but pulling it out require significant skills and strenght.I swap the pouch with the one used by the Kindle eBook reader. It works perfect both way, my wife is happy with this new pouch for her old Kindle as it is thinner and more sturdy.The new tablet well worths the money.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|For a sub $300 tablet this is a great device. It's pretty snappy and a good purchase for some one interested in getting a tablet. The 7&#34; is a great size and it feels very nice even while reading, pretty light too.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Product arrived on time and delivers expected service.... Does what you expect...and MORE!!!...I especially like the external drive 32 gb advantage.........Yes i would recommend this purchase to another person...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have a iPad, but I use a android phone. Now I have a tablet set up like my phone. Google play cards are sold in most retail stores so now you don't have to use your credit card for apps and music. Just started using it but I love it so far.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Had this since mid-August. I got it to replace my rooted BN Nook Color. It does everything that the NC does only better. Now I don't have to worry about drops or lockups. And I can still use my BN account to buy ebooks.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a very good tablet. So far there is nothing I have tried that it can't run, and run well. I love the flexibility of the Android OS. The screen is bright and sharp. The sound if very good even from the internal speakers, and the connectivity with WiFi, Bluetooth 3.0, and with an adapter USB is a big plus. My only complaint is the inability to move apps to the external SD Card.Speaking of which the support for using an external SD card is one of the main reason I chose this tablet over the others, even without apps to SD having 32gb for movies, TV shows and Music is awesome (I have ordered a 64gb card as well, but I haven't received it yet).Overall a great tablet for a great price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Good Display, excellent Battery, sensitive touch screenGood for Kids.Amazing rear facing camera video quality.good for video calling
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|meets my expectations. Great for an entry level tablet. Could be a little easier to use certain apps ie: maps
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I ordered the Samsung Galaxy tab 2 7 inch last Dec. 18,2012. On the details page,it says they will have available stock on Dec.22,2012 and it says to Order now to reserve the item. So I placed my order and the estimated delivery date was Dec.27,2012. I was a little sad since I was planning to give this tablet to my husband as a Christmas present. The next day, I got an email that they have an available stock and that they are shipping my order sooner.The guaranteed delivery date would be Dec.21,2012. I was so excited when I read the good news from AMAZON.I was so happy that AMAZON make things possible and they go beyond to give customers what we need and when we need them. Last Dec.21,2012 I was waiting for my order and it even arrived earlier than what I expected. The expected time would be 3:00pm but they arrived 5 minutes earlier which made me more happier. Very fast shipping!!! Keep it up. I hope my husband will love his present this Christmas.Merry Christmas to you all! =)

tablet_galaxy_tab|Does everything the iPad does an much more plus it doesn't weigh as much as the gargantuan iPad because it's plastic and not glass in the screen
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I received my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi) a few days ago. While I'm still learning to use it, I can say already that I'm very happy with this purchase.I am a Spanish teacher and I have a long commute. I wanted a light tablet which allowed me to read books, as well as work on my lessons during my commute. I also wanted a tablet that could fit in my purse. After using my sister's Kindle for a couple of days, I was sure that I didn't like it. I needed a more user-friendly tablet that allowed me to do things easily.After reading many reviews, I decided to buy this one. I'm so happy! I have been using it for only a few days. Reading is comfortable (I prefer to hold it horizontally) and my eyes are also happy. I uploaded some material for my classes and used it already with one student. He enjoyed it very much and I know this will be an excellent teaching tool.I am still discovering new apps but so far I love the possibility of reading newspaper articles even without being connected to the Internet. I can check my e-mails, take notes, visit my favorite sites and even take pictures (and videos) without any problem. Videos look great.Typing is smooth but I still have to find a way to add Spanish accents marks, which I'm sure is possible.So far, it's the perfect tablet for my needs and I find myself using it also at home, instead of my laptop.I also bought a SanDisk microSDHC 32GB Flash Memory Card to expand the memory and Poetic Slimbook Leather Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. They are also perfect. I might get a stylus pen for taking notes.One day later: I found out how to add Spanish accents marks. Just hold the letter for a second and the keyboard will show you the options. For ex.: hold the "e" and it will give you the possibility of adding an "&eacute;".Two months later: I still love this tablet. I've been using it daily and the only problem I had so far was with the SanDisk microSDHC 32GB Flash Memory Card. It crashed twice when turning the tablet on. In these occasions I got an alert that I needed to format the memory card and that all my content would be lost. It was annoying but at least it happened at home and I was able to copy the material I needed from my laptop. But if it had happened during one of my classes, it would definitely had been very frustrating.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Following all the good reviews this Tab has received, I decided to by one. Previously, I had a Amazon Kindle and the upgrade to Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, 7 has been a very good experience. I like the 7" because it fit my needs.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|First the product review:After going through a round of 10.1 inch tablets, I felt that 7" is better to hold and does essentially most of the things you need a tablet for. So I bought this tab. After 3 days of usage, I would say it fits my needs well. I don't care much about HD or full HD or WXVGA, I would reach out for my laptop anyway for most of the tasks, as I find it more productive. The battery is decent, comparable to most of the tablets on the market. Charging time is a little longer than say Asus tablets, but I do it at night mostly. Another thing I noticed is that the charging cable is short like all other Samsung tablets, which is slightly frustrating.Now comparing it with the nexus. The Nexus has all the hardware better than this, but there are a couple of reasons I am considering keeping this device. 1 - No sdcard support on Nexus. I will be using my device mostly for music storage, and 16 GB is quite limiting for me. I can manage by juggling my files around, but that would be frequent enough to annoy me, I think. Plus, if I use streaming services like Spotify or Rdio, I will have serious loss of space. 2 - It's Asus. All those who have tried their tablets know about the pathetic browser issue. Given the fact that even Prime has it, I doubt they would have resolved it in this one. That's something to look out for!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was initially only looking to replace my old iPod nano and considering an upgrade to the iPod touch; after reviewing prices with the iPod touch starting at $200 bucks I began comparing that to lesser valued tablets. When I finally ran across the Galaxy tab, after going back and forth between reviews of this and the Blackberry tablet I'll admit, I'm more than satisfied with my decision! The sound and pictures are AWESOME (not to mention I also purchased a pair of Coby CV215BLK Deep Bass Stereo Headphones and Earphones (Black) for about 8 bucks through Amazon and its like my head is in the club 24/7!!) Im not a computer geek so I couldn't tell you anything about apps, gigabytes or any of that stuff.. but considering all of the features and quality I get when all I was looking to do was listen to music, I'm frickin blown away!! Samsung has really outdone themselves with this tablet! Its sleek enough to fit in pocket (not my skinny jeans of course, but you know what I mean)and it's extremely easy to figure how to use. I dont know what apple has to offer with the iPad and anybody else for their $500+ tablets but I'll tell you this, Samsung has my business for LIFE with this one product! ,
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|What to like:can hold in one hand (see "what not to like" counter point)can act as a multimedia tv remote using smart peel remote but pretty slow even with solid Internet connection. There's always one or more TV program who's picture loads with some delay.battery life is quite good but also takes extremely long time to recharge.Pleasant GPS voice. Pico Text To Speech that came with my phone is horrible in comparison.Solid Build Quality.Beautiful bright display. IMO better than ipad2. Haven't tried ipad3.Comes with Android 4 Ice Cream Sandwich.What not to like:speakers are on the bottom. So if you rotate to watch movies sound is only coming from right or left. mehStill doesn't work with Hulu website (even with supposed "browser desktop mode" unless you root.Hard to hold in one hand for long periods. This is solved by purchasing a separate case with handle.Button for volume and screen lock is put on the same side that your hand will cover when holding with one hand. You will inevitably hit the volume and lock screen button when holding this unit. FREAKING unbelievably annoying. They should move those buttons to the top of the unit.No offline GPS included. You're going to have to do additional work to get offline gps to work.Propietary samsung USB / Charging cable.Difficult to attach as USB drive. Haven't succeeded in attaching as usb drive on XP yet.If they solved the annoying issues it would be a perfect 5 and an absolute ipad killer. But so many annoying issues brings this unit back down to reality.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The new Tab 2 7-inch is a perfect blend of size, ease of use, and power. Ice Cream Sandwich is very smooth and fast on this pad. The image quality and touch screen sensitivity are excellent. The Gorilla Glass (R) screen surface is very sensitive as well as very strong allowing for use without the need for a protector overlay. I installed a 32GB class 10 SCHD card so it has the same total storage capacity as my Tab 10 and the combination cost was less than half of the Tab 10. It has also proven to be a great ebook for use at night or under low light conditions without the need of an external light due to the backlit screen making it perfect for a travel ebook reader. The print is not quite as good as a Kindle B&W reader but close enough. Overall, the size and weight factors make this a pleasure to use for book reading, news, and watching movies. The only thing on my wish list for this tablet is a 8 to 16 Meg camera.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This product is awesome! Great color screen, small jacket pocket size, long battery life and workable GPS. In addition you get access to tons of free downloadable utilities.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This purchase was made for my wife, and at first I as going with the Kindle Fire. However after seeing many videos on youtube about the lack of customization and no access to the true Google market I decided to drop the extra $50 and buy something that gives more options without the need to have Root Access.So far this budget tablet has lived up to all my expectations. We get a full day of usage on a full charge, and that includes gaming, ebooks, facebook, and web surfing.If all you need is a good ebook reader with a few extra features then by all means the Kindle should be fine for you, but if you want a good tablet that can offer more options, take a look at the Samsung Tab 2 running android ICS.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi)This little gem, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi, is all I'll ever need in a tablet. Battery life is nearly a whole day when streaming music from Google Play or Spotify. Organizing lots of email accounts for multiple users in our house on 1 tablet was a snap. The TV remote is really cool and works out of the box. Google Voice doesn't yet support GTalk -- yet -- but GTalk supports excellent video conferencing as does Skype for WiFi calling Skype to Skype and Skype to phone. And the GPS is taken to a whole new level with big screen, portability, forward and rear facing cameras and LOTS more.I use it with my Samsung Galaxy S 4G and T-Mobile tethering and share 6 WiFi devices including this tablet in the Seattle, WA area and get an excellent user experience with the Samsung Tab 2...as good as it is WiFi'd into Comcast at home. Nice setup and easy to use. Best 249 you'll ever spend. I have a Kindle Fire as well and this is WAY over the Fire in quality and capability. Pay 49 more and get a real tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've used the Acer Iconia, all the way down to a less than desirable Pandigital tab, and this one rocks them all. Fast, great screen, runs practically anything...fast! I dare say you will not be disappointed! My only gripe is the proprietary connecting cable, but seriously...i can live with that in light of it's many many pluses. Get one!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet was my first real piece of gadgetry. I received it for Christmas, and I am infinitely glad I did. I am not picky about screen size; given its functionality, this tablet was absolutely perfect! I use it to read the news in the morning, watch Netflix, go on Facebook, and occasionally play some of the app games - it is simply awesome. The touchscreen is very responsive and the Android interface is terrific (not to mention I was already a huge Samsung fan). For those of you who just want a simple, reliable tablet...for the price, it doesn't get any better!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Initially this was supposed to be for our daughter for her birthday, but it appears now it is a family gift :).. the tablet is quick and links to the tv, much better display than the original one we chose.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I chose Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 because I cannot afford an Ipad :D plus access to Android apps was too tempting. I believe Samsung is competitive when it comes to their products' quality. My tablet is one day old with me and I'm loving it!!But the only downside is that I bought it from seller Essex Technology Group with Used-Like New condition. They said the packaging was slightly damaged to check that the unit would work. I didn't mind that but I got really upset when I switched on the tablet and found it was locked! I contacted Samsung support and gave me instructions on how to hard reset the device. Whew, satisfied with Samsung customer service and satisfied with my new tabletReview update [12/10/12]I have been using this tablet for 3 months now. It still works great except for the battery -- It drains very fast whenever I'm either reading an e-book, playing Boogle game, or browsing on Facebook. Settings are set to power-save mode, disabled auto-rotation, no sound, no background apps running, disabled notifications, etc. The only time it doesn't drain much battery is when it's idle... duh! for that I am dissatisfied with Samsung's battery life cycle.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very user friendly, has a lot to offer. I was going to go with the Kindle Fire, but it did not have expandable memory like the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. I love it, still learining about it, but thats the fun. Love this product!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love this tablet small enough to fit in my purse.big enough to do all i need as a computer. i am aa 56 yeazr old non techie that just likes to play but i found it can do much more so happy with my choice have been looking for a couple of months and reading reviews of all products i chose this LOVE IT and with help from my seventeen year old grandaughter still learning more
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this when it was at height of price point. Now price is coming down sharply, not sure why. This device really is amazing. I have an iPad2 (16gb / wifi) and I like the Galaxy Tab 2 better because it is light and the right form-factor for bedtime reading. Mostly use the iPad on a table or lap, but this I can hold in front of my face while laying down to read. The Galaxy Tab 2 is vastly lighter than iPad 2. My only druther is that I wish all android devices came with a configuration setting to enable root access instead of a long, laborious process requiring a development environment, and a dangerous process that risks "bricking" the device rendering it useless, just to enable root access. It's ridiculous.I also use the Galaxy Tab 2 for android development and the new android OS (4+) is such a leap forward from versions 2 and 3. I just love the 7" screen and think it's the ideal balance for reading and using applications. The device itself is robust, usable, stable, and high performance. Which is probably why Samsung has gotten into trouble with Apple. Because they copied the things they did well. Apple worked hard to steal those patents in the first place. Off my soapbox now... Get one of these before they are gone, can't beat the price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought one for my wife to use and loved it so much I bought myself one. It is a great step up from a smartphone and much easier to carry than a full-sized tablet. ICS is an excellent upgrade for Android.Great device.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Took me a while to learn this unit, but I am in my 70s and most things take me a while to learn. Works great, is very fast, has tons of features, super bright clear screen, very long battery life. I would highly recommend this tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I just purchased the galaxy tab. In the ads it showed running movies and tv shows. Everything seems to be running fast and great but it doesn't have a flash player or won't download one so movies aren't playing?
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My review is for those who are not at all tech savvy. I got this for my birthday about 1.5 months ago and I absolutely love it so far. It's easy to use, lightweight, and definitely simple to figure out. I don't know how it compares to any other tablet out there, so don't read this for comparisons. If you've never had a tablet before, this is a great one to start out on. It's also very durable as I have dropped it several times. I do recommend getting a case for it though. If you're finger print phobic like I am, I would also recommend a plastic screen. Both can be found at great prices on Amazon. The cord that comes with it is very short and I find myself sitting next to an outlet if I want to use it and charge at the same time. Overall, great for the technology challenged like me.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my wife for a gift and she has really enjoyed it. She had mentioned wanting to get an ereader recently, but I thought this might be a better option. We were already familiar with Android from our HTC phones, so there was only a small learning curve with the quirks of Android 4.0 and Samsung's UI. After setting up Nook and the rest of our apps, she was off and running. One of the nice features that I hadn't really considered that she is enjoying quite a bit is the DNLA capability to stream music from our PC to the tablet.The device performs great, and my wife almost always turns to her tablet over her phone now. Very responsive, and the battery lasts for a long time.Now I want a tablet too...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Perfect for me! I have an iPad too but this device is simply smooth, quick, light. My son has enjoy it a lot since he can play and see YouTube videos in an easy way.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Anyone who is geeked out like me would choose the Samsung Galaxya Tab2 7.0 over a Kindle any time. Not to disrespect a Kindle its just ment for more simple minded people. This tab gives me all the perks while doing whatever the kindle does and much much more. I love it and I sleep with it under my pillow.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Replacing the Original Tab. This was the best move I made.The form and size is less bulky and more ergonomic than the Tab. It is easy to hold the weight is good for long periods of reading unlike any 10" tablet I have owned or used. Transporting in a suit or back pocket is a plus.Speed and UI is snappy for a single core processor. Which is a disappointment since the predecessor had a dual core but, to keep the cost low it is a sacrifice I can easily live with.Battery Life is the best of any computing device I have ever owned I don't have to worry about charging it all the time nor worry about not having enough battery for daily use.Storage Capacity and SD Slot. While is was also disappointing in having only 8GB's of storage when the predecessors offering 16 & 32 GB's, The ability to add up to 64 GB's cards and easy integration of cards make this not really noticeable at all. No matter what case you may put this in accessing the SD slot is arduous task to say the least.Screen. Is bright but not as vivid as other tablets but for the price it is pretty darn good. The screen is great for watching media but not the best for reading periodicals. If you are in to reading books, manuals, & periodicals I would recommend a 4:3 ratio screen or a 10" tablet or I hate to say an iXxx device. Not wanting to have a iXxx device or a hand heavy 10" tablet is a sacrifice I am willing to make.The Tab 2 is a great value and should be relevant in years to come. I don't see it becoming so out dated any time soon.

tablet_galaxy_tab|From my research on tablets I decided to try this product as my introduction to the tablet world. I have extensive experience with computers but this was a new world to me. It somehow seemed silly to me to name an operating system "Ice Cream Sandwich" or "Jelly Bean".I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something which I originally viewed as a fad but my children and grandchildren can't seem to get along without these devices. By the way - I don't have a smartphone - only a dumb phone for use in emergency. I am learning about apps and operation of the device. So far no problems and I am beginning to rely on it for information. I use it with my home wi-fi set up and I find that there are more and more locations that allow public connection. I even used the device to play a game while waiting to see a doctor. - The waiting time went by faster.Perhaps there are better devices but for the "toe in the water" experience this device works well and there are many applications for it - you just have to learn where to look and how to use them. If grade school kids can learn then "why oh why can't I".I would like to tell more of my experiences but so far they are minimal - but so far - all good!Maybe I will tell you more in the future - that is if I can tear myself away from being chained to this device.By the way - the price was right and better than what was asked for a competing device named after a piece of fruit that tempted a women a long time ago! For an older guy this was important!!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had this tablet for about 4 months. I was comparing it to Nexus 7 and others, but by far this is the best tablet for everyday use. It doesn't have the cpu power that the Nexus does, or the battery life of apple products, but it is not enough to make a difference if you use this to play casual games, reading, surfing the net, HD videos and of course listening to music. The reason I chose this tablet is because of the expandable memory. I have a Polaroid 32gb SD card with a 10 speed rating (which matters a lot... research SD card speed on google) and I have no lag on any of my movies or music Polaroid 32 GB CL10 micro SDHC Flash Memory Cards for Tablet PCs and Smartphones (P-SDU32G10-EFPOL). Please buy yourself a screen protector and a case both are essential to have if you buy any tablet. When buying a case for your SGT2 make sure you get one that is specifically for SGT2 not SGT Plus or the original. They all have different thicknesses and dimensions.One con is battery life. The battery isn't great, but it's not horrible either. If you use this tablet continuously all day, you have to live with at least a good 4-5 hour battery life. I charge my battery every night. Use it on my 1 hour commute to work listening to music and sporadically throughout a 8 hour span. Then another 1 hour commute, listening to music and by the time I get home I usually have about half of battery life. So I can probably use it continuously for another 2-3 hours depending if I am watching videos or just playing games or surfing the net. Buy another wall charger when you can and keep it on you. When buying charger for home or car make sure they are for tablets. Regular mobile phone wall chargers and car chargers don't put out enough juice to charge the tablets.PowerGen Dual USB Port 2A 10w (fast) Heavy Duty Ouput Car Charger - WhiteIn conclusion, if you want a tablet and don't want to get ripped off by buying an Apple iPad or get the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. Best specifications and best price. Best value period.

tablet_galaxy_tab|The Galaxy Tab works as it should. The addition of Task Manager is a good way to toggle between apps. The screen is a bit small I attribute that to the size of tablet I bought. "Samsung apps" provides more ways to get apps and it's easy to use.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Got this for my husbands birthday and he loves it!!! We have an ipad, that he would use, but hated it. So know he can browse, read the paper on line, shop, skype, play games - etc. He's found it to be very handy. He's had it for over a month now and I haven't heard one single complant on it. It's a keeper!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have a windows 7 Samsung tablet (now with Windows 8 beta on it) but its a bit too large to carry around for casual use, although it is invaluable when I need to run windows apps. Found this little gem for those times I just want to be able to browse the internet or read books. Bluetooth, WiFi etc work just as expected. Netflix movie streaming works great. Google Music allows me to play my entire CD collection. Bluetooth connection to Philips Fidelio speakers work great too. Screen is nice and bright. The operating system and apps are very responsive. Google maps with GPS navigation were an unexpected bonus.I have also tried pairing a bluetooth mouse and keyboard to it, which work fine, but I don't really use. For any keyboard intensive or graphics work, I can use the Windows tablet.All in all, really happy with it and no complaints ... except.. maybe the camera is less than impressive. Photos and videos, unless shot in bright outdoor light, are disappointing. But apart from that, extremely happy with it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|The table is very useful and versatile, works great and has been helpful in searches for interne. Operating as video and camera equipment is excellent nothing to envy to other tables.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got my tablet for mother's day and I am loving it. So far I haven't had any problems. I browse the internet, watch videos online, play games, etc. I have several of the same apps that I have on my phone and they work great.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this tablet because I wanted more screen area and was sick of using my iPod Touch for all my internet browsing on the couch and on the go. I had high hopes for this, but it turned out to be just OK. I know everyone says you shouldn't compare these cheaper tablets to the apple tablets, so I'm going to compare it to my Apple iPod touch... seems more even and what I was used to, right?The Bad: I agree with previous reviewers in that the touch of your finger on the screen seems slightly off... and there is no way to calibrate it. The keyboard is absolutely frustrating to use, in either horizontal or vertical format - it is just an annoying pain. I had an easier time typing on my little iPod!!! This is either a Samsung issue or it's an android thing... I wouldn't know as I am mostly an Apple user. I was also extremely annoyed that it didn't come with an auto-correct or any spell check built in. Also the enter button is right next to the delete button, so when I have to go back constantly to fix what I typed, I would sometimes hit enter instead (on facebook for example) and it would post my half finished, badly spelled message. Another thing is there is no up/down/left/right arrow to quickly move the cursor, you have to use the clunky touch to try to get it where you want, which isn't smooth at all (again, an android issue or Samsung, I'm not sure). Another thing I've found coming from my little iPod touch is that the Android apps for this seem to be more clumsy and with less features. I really am not too fond of the facebook, ebay, and amazon apps that are available for this... not a huge deal since you can still go to the actual website, but I would have thought they would be really similar, unfortunately no.The Good: It seems to be pretty lightweight. The screen is really nice and clear due to the higher pixel count for it's size. I like how in the browser you have the option to request a desktop website, because sometimes the mobile sites seem odd on the 7" screen, since they are mostly built for smaller phone screens. Flash does work in the default web browser, although I've found I like using google chrome instead, which doesn't support flash. It does have tabbed browsing on both browsers, which I like and was used to. Everything seems to be pretty quick on this, I've only had a little web lag when I had multiple tabs open. The task manager works great to clear some RAM if you need it.All in all, I kind of have a love/hate relationship with this tablet. It is definitely nice to have the larger screen, but at times I find myself cursing at it in my head. Don't expect to do any fast word processing, or facebooking it up : ) If you have big sausage fingers you will probably have an even harder time, as I have pretty narrow fingers and still have this thing hitting letters I don't want.EDIT: I changed my review to 4 stars since my last review. I tried out the hackers keyboard program from the app store, and also the GO Keyboard, and am using the GO. This is MUCH better than the Samsung factory keyboard. Ive been getting used to other features of the tablet as well, so four stars.EDIT 2: Updated to the new software and the standard keyboard has changed and is much more responsive and now has auto correct and spell check.

tablet_galaxy_tab|First off, Amazon is the best place to buy. The first unit hada dead pixel. I sent for replacement -not sure if I would get it by fathers day. Got replacement in two days, in time.The galaxy2.7.0 is the best tablet out there for the price. Size is perfect for one handed use and weight means you dont feel it much.Other reviews give good details about tablet- nothing more I got to say.Get it and you will enjoy it

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had my tablet about 1 week now... it is a little different from an I-product, but after you find where things have been put, it is not too bad to figure out through intuition.The tablet seems to be well made, and the touch screen is very responsive (just like an I-product). Overall, I have been very pleased with this product. It is exactly what I was looking for; as I wanted a good responsive reader as the primarly task, but having access to the internet in something bigger than a phone, but smaller than a netbook or 10 inch was perfect. Would have been nice if it were 50.00 cheaper like the Fire, but I think it is probably worth the extra.Overall, I am very happy with the Tablet 2.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is the first Android device I've bought and I have to say that I am impressed with just how easy it is to get going. Sure the UI needs a couple of hours to get used to (being used to iDevices), but once you get the hang of it, its pretty easy to use.I bought the tablet for my mum so that she can check her emails and Skype with us, so I guess the real test will come once she gets it and start using it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich)Externel StorageFast (No lag on Angry Birds or any basic application. Smooth Scrolling)Samsung Kies (Multi OS support for syncing music, videos, etc. Works really well)I actually bought a Kindle Fire and tried it for a few days before returning it. Even rooted, the Kindle Fire is nowhere near the level of the Tab. The only downside to not getting an Amazon Kindle Fire is limited access to the Kindle store (You don't get the account upgrade).That being said, the Tab 2 is a MUCH better value over the Kindle Fire. Well worth the additional $50. Don't hesitate to buy it. It's obviously not an iPad, but it's also half the price of an iPad so it's not fair to compare the two.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I must admit, I came into Best Buy ready to buy an iPad. Thank goodness I used the display unit first. I realized the iPad was a little too bulky for my taste, no flash or microSD card slot (!!!), and I wanted an interface I could customize a bit more. The kind man that worked there asked me what I wanted in a tablet, and I replied that I'd want it mostly for e-mail, games, videos, e-book reading, and light web-browsing and he suggested the Kindle Fire. After playing around with the Fire for maybe 30 minutes, I decided the size was perfect, BUT I knew I needed a tablet with Google Play after taking a look at Amazon's AppStore. I then migrated to the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. Much lighter and easier to hold, had Google Play + cameras and a microphone (with a 3-year old at home, a microphone is a must for Talking Tom!), and ICS, but what really sold me was the screen quality. I was wowed when I watched the Moments of Everyday Life demo video. Looked better than my TV. So, of course I had to buy it. I've now had it for 1 1/2 days, and LOVE it. My Nook magizenes and books synced to my device quickly and easily, games like Talking Tom, Bakery Story, and Tiny Tower work great, the device is much faster than I expected, and customizing my Tab 2 with wallpapers and such took minutes. I actually don't mind TouchWiz. I like waking up in the morning and being able to see the weather and top stories on Yahoo by just turning on my tablet. Multitouch is great, Fruit Ninja worked with 5 fingers. Overall it is a great buy, and the extra $50 I spent on this than the Kindle Fire is the least of my worries.

tablet_galaxy_tab|From Galaxy Tab 7" to Galaxy Player 5" to Kindle Fire, and now Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.0 7". Actually I just own the Fire and Tab 2.0 now. Galaxy Player 5" was returned due to poor sound, and Galaxy Tab was traded in.The combination of 7"-size, light weight, Android ICS, Galaxy Music and Video Player with SoundAlive, and competitive price--it's a winner.This tablet has become my new goto electronic gadget. For the $239-price at Costco--I got myself a new Samsung Galaxy Music and Video Player with SoundAlive, plus all the benefits of Android ICS and wifi connectivity. I use it a lot now during my nursing clinicals for reference--rather than carrying a few index cards. This tablet has all my textbooks--all its bulk and weight--now in electronic format using Kindle and VitalSource Bookshelf for all my Evolve nursing books and reference materials, plus all my powerpoint class lectures, and all the pdf handout materials.Easy to carry around, quick and responsive, excellent Samsung filing system, plus room for my 32-GB microSD.Android ICS is a fantastic way to use my Tab 2 for Gmail, Contact, Calendar, Google Voice voicemail and texting, Google Earth, maps, and navigation (even if I'm only tethered to a wifi, it's a nice to do cyber travel in the comfort of a sofa while zooming in to places far away using earth-map-nav.Great product!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I just purchased the Samsung Galaxy 2 tablet (7 inch) and am now getting to know it. I had a difficult time connecting it to my WiFi (spent hours trying) and finally broke down and called customer service. After reading some of the reviews about customer service I did not anticipate being helped. Was I wrong. A very knowledgeable, friendly, patient, easy to understand tech named AJ spent over an hour on the phone with me walking me through every possibility. It turned out that the problem was not the tablet or Samsung's fault but the password my husband insisted was correct turned out to be incorrect. AJ helped me locate the correct password and setting it up was then a breeze. He remained on the phone to help me connect to Google which then allowed me to use the apps which are already included. I could easily transfer my Kindle books and my Netflix movies. I am looking forward to all of the uses this little tab provides and am planning on taking it with me on various vacations so that I can have the internet with me. Who would've thought that as a grandmother with only a fair amount of tech savvy I would be able to easily navigate these devices. Thank you Samsung and thank you AJ.

tablet_galaxy_tab|My sister recently got the kindle fire and i completely love this one more!! It barely lags, has acess to over 450,000 apps, good back and front camera, great for reading, and small and light but sturdy. I was thinking about getting either the blackberry playbook, tte Galaxy tab 2 7.0, or the Lenovo Ideapad A1, and i decided with this. It was the right decision! After using all three tablets at a radioshack, i was pleasently suprised on how well the tablet worked compared to the others. Although the Playbook has a better camera, The tAb completely blew it out of the water! The ideapad was OK, but nothing i would pay $200 for. And yes, i know the tab is kind've pricey compared to some of the other tablets in its category, but I think the Tab 2.0 series are right after the iPad!!!! LOVE IT AND RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE!!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this one to replace my old SGT with Froyo that getting slow and froze a lot. I love this one with one exception: have not been able to make a connection between my Mac and the GT2. Tried Kies, followed instructions on the web with no luck. Any ideas? The old GT was easy in that sense. So what I did was to transfer my old micro sd card filled with files into the new one. Worked great.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have a Kindle Fire and wanted a unit that I can play downladed music videos and movies on. Unfortunately because of the KF not having an SD card slot, I ended purchasing this unit. The unit has a beautiful screen and is very responsive. I will not go into the technical praises since it has been done in previous reviews, but I will inform you on some of the idiosyncrasies of the unit. First of all the Ice Cream Sandwich OS is too new. Not a lot of apps work with it. The Adobe Flash player do not work on all websites. Even though Adobe claims is compatible with ICS. Sometimes when you download an app it makes it difficult to find. If you have all you apps screens full you may have to move them around to make room for any additional apps. The apps move from screen to avaialable screen sometimes takes a few tries. Accessories for the unit are hard to find and you may have to make some custom cuts to have access to the earphone plug. This cover I found works best for this unit. (Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Silicone Protective Cover Case - Black Buy new : $29.99 now $5.08). For this one I only had to make a hole for the earphones, otherwise works excelent. Since I like to keep my products as new as possible I also purchased this item,(Brand New Stylish Protective Cover Folio Leather Case (Black) for Amazon Kindle Fire Tablet PC for the Kindle Fire, Stylus Pen - By Abacus24-7 $5.99. They have a couple of models. I have purchased this previously for my Kindle and it's a very nice looking sturdy case. The only thing is that it does not have a hole for the back camera. But since I don't use the camera it didn't matter to me. For the car you would need a cigarette USB plug. I recomment something similar to the Griffin Powerjolt Dual Universal USB Micro and also a couple of charging/data cables like the Samsung Galaxy Tab Data Cable (Charging) USB to 30 Pin (ECC1DP0UBEGSTA) $6.12 here in Amazon. Also the HHI Anti-Fingerprint, Anti-Glare, Matte Finished Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7.0) (Package include a HandHelditems Sketch Stylus Pen) This I purchased but did not use since I had the one I purchased atBest Buy for $29.99. I think this other one will work just as good.Please note that I'm only giving you suggestions on items that I have purchased and that have worked for me whatever you end up purchasing is totally up to you.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I wound up selling this to my friend, who loves it. But 7&#34; was just too small for a tablet, in my opinion. The device itself and the features are great. Please note if you are thinking of using a stylus pen with it, that it will **not** work with the pens that are for use with the Galaxy Note series.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I wanted to order my 2 grandkids a Galaxy Tablet 2 for Christmas because they kept fighting to use my Galaxy Tablet 1. I had to literally time them on it so they could take turns with the other child. I couldn't believe it when I checked Amazon and the price was the lowest I had seen anywhere so I ordered 2 tablets for the two of them. The next day I decided to order me one because I had the 1 and wanted to upgrade to the 2.What a surprise they had on Christmas morning when they opened them up. The excitement was endless! They are still thanking me.Thank you Amazon for offering your customers the best prices out there. I am a true Amazon lover and will continue to order your products.Sincerely,Mary L. Bryan

tablet_galaxy_tab|I ordered a refurbished Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 for my husband at a great price and it arrived packed well, with the cord and charger adapter and manual. He has been playing with it for a few days now and loves it, discovering new things every day. It came on right away, charges with both the wall adapter and if plugged into his desktop computer. He took his micro SD card from his old tablet and put it in this, and could access all of his music. The apps are great, he has many MANY more to explore, just scratching the surface, but very happy so far. I have a Kindle Fire HD which I purchased within the past couple of months and we've been comparing notes. One thing that I can do is hook the Kindle Fire up to our TV with HD(whateveryoucallthatcord:-) and we can watch movies...you can't do that with the Samsung. He has access to all the google play apps, I am not able to use all of them unless I can figure out a work-around, but Amazon provides me with more than I know what to do with. I don't have a micro sd card slot, but can store on Amazon Cloud. So each has it's advantages, and we are both happy with what we have:-)As for the refurbished part, we often by refurbished items, and have never had a problem with them.I'm not very technical, so can't explain all the techie things very well, but there's plenty of other reviews that provide that.

tablet_galaxy_tab|The size of this tablet is perfect and the features that it has make it a great product. I did not give it 5 stars because of the battery life; it lasts approx. 1 day of normal usage.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this tablet with the intention of taking it on a trip overseas, and travel in general. I don't currently own a smart phone or a laptop; and did not really want a full 10 inch size tablet. I have found other reviews of it to be spot on. It actually was the perfect size to slip in a carry-on, and take everywhere with me. Not being a terribly technology-savvy person, I did find it easy to set up and use. I used the Samsung website to read the manual for any questions I had, and the site was quite helpful. I did add a 32GB memory card, as others have recommended, and found that it ran quite a bit faster. Even though I could expand the size of the page and type, using it for extended e-mails and internet use made me a bit bug-eyed! And it actually had about 5 hours of life on a battery charge; also charges fairly quickly. Using the Amazon APP store and website to download apps, music, and books from Kindle was incredibly easy.My only negative is the cursed word-spelling prompts. On many occasions, I was not able to spell the name of a person or use a certain work because I could not override the word-spelling prompts. (Does anyone know if this feature can be turned off?) I wish I could rate it 4.5 stars!Overall, it performs well and is the perfect size to tuck in a purse, backpack, or carry on. Glad I bought it!

tablet_galaxy_tab|got myself one back in June and never got around to reviewing it. this is one very good value for the cost if you shop around. was tempted by the nexus 7 but the lack of rear camera and micro sd were deal breakers for me. I have not been using the tab as much as I though I would, but when I do it's speedy and more then gets the job done. I average about 2 and 1/2 days of standby battery time with wifi on and the weather widget syncing every 3 to 6 hours. I see no need to use live wallpapers as they tend to be battery life killers. I tend to leave bluetooth and gps off when I dont need them. all and all I love the tab 2 7.0

tablet_galaxy_tab|I am a techno geek who is adamantly against all things Apple (I don't like how obsolete their products get in a relatively short amount of time) so I was looking for an alternative to shelling out $500 for an iPad. I discovered the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. I had been looking at the Kindle Fire but found the stripped down version of the Android operating system to be too limiting. Enter the Galaxy Tab. It was in my price range, could do everything I needed, had a slot for micro SD cards for my media, was by Samsung which is a company I've had luck with before, and the reviews that I saw were mostly positive.I went to a local shop that carries the Galaxy Tab to play with it before purchasing. It passed my tests and one came home to me shortly thereafter. I have basically been very pleased with it. Like others have said, the battery life is a bit short, but I can get a full day out of playing with it before it needs to be charged so it's fine for me. The wire that comes with it is ridiculously short (Samsung people take note, this really bites!!!), and it doesn't charge when plugged into the USB port on my laptop which I find bizarre. Also, I don't think this is a Galaxy Tab problem, but an Adobe one, I can't play the flash games on Facebook on the Galaxy Tab. I don't know of any tab that it works on though.What I like about it is: The size is perfect for tossing in my bag when I want to bring it with me. It is pretty easy to use. The Android market is getting better with each passing day and there are very few apps that I want but can't get yet. The screen is crisp, clear, and the touch screen works well. There are widgets that I can put up on the home page (and other ones) that are really helpful. By far the best feature of this Tab is the micro SD slot. The Galaxy itself only has 8GB on board which is really only about 6 with the OS and other apps loaded (some of which I wish I could delete but I can't) With the SD slot, I can buy multiple cards and load my music, movies and TV shows without losing space on my Tab. I have 3 cards now and have more on my wishlist. This is a fabulous feature for someone who has a lot of media but who doesn't need it all on the Tab all the time.All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had this tablet for a couple of months now and I still like it as much as I did to begin with. It is an excellent size to carry around. It has good battery life and a beautiful display. I can't think of anything I don't like about it. If you found the 10 inch tablets to be hard to hold I recommend this tablet.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I was able to root my Tab to Cyanogenmod 9, which is a bare implementation of ICS. Instructions were found here: [...]I REALLY like my Tab without all of the bloatware that comes from Samsung.This is the first place I looked for "rooting" instruction: [...]You'll need the Odin3 v1.85.exe from the rootzwiki site to install the ClockworkMod-Recovery program and proceed.The rooting process is not for the fainthearted :-)======These are the accessories I've bought for the Tab:Case: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083OYIBW/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01USB cable-adapter: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005YWIRBS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i006-foot USB charging cable: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IR2J2M/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00Bluetooth keyboard: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005EOWBKE/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00

tablet_galaxy_tab|Since I know there are a lot of first time buyers out there, I am going to take you through the process that led me to purchasing the Galaxy2 for my mother, in place of the Kindle fire.1) How easy is it to use right out of the box? This was probably the biggest concern that I had. Generally speaking, more advanced products tend to require a more advanced user. Since the Galaxy2 is functionally better than the Kindle fire, I was concerned the amount of functionality could actually make this less so for my less-than-tech-savvy-Mother. Obviously, I took the chance and made the purchase. So far she has hit the ground running, and is in love with this thing. The First gen Kindle she swore she was "Not trying to replace" is collecting dust. I recently received a text message from back home with my grandfather playing a card app, something he has been doing every night since he arrived.2) It's standout features? What makes this a better decision than the Fire? Much more noticeable than the power under the hood; Front/Back facing camera and expandable memory. - Without Expandable memory, you get X number of gigs. Want to upgrade memory? Prepare to buy a brand new unit. With expandable memory, the 8 gig Galaxy 2 can be transformed into a 40 gig unit for less then 20 bucks. - Front/back facing camera really is meant for skype capabilities. I live across the state, so it's nice to be able to speak face to face with my family.Long story short, great purchase.

tablet_galaxy_tab|By the time i ordered my Tab 2, i realized that a more powerful tablet was comming out in two weeks for cheaper. My friend had bought the asus, but yet I am still happy with my Tab 2. It is more video friendly with MX player, and is very landscape friendly. The asus had problems with turning vertical at times, and had limitations with video and no expandable mini sd slot. I am very happy with my purchase. I watch videos at work, and play all my games just fine. The wireless tether works great for places with no wifi. So glad I bought this thing, - and i would not change up for any other tablet on the market right now.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The tablet in my opinion is amazing. However the charger cable may be a little short. Mostly this product is great.The speakers on the side are pretty good if you use them. There are 2 cameras front and back. The back camera take pretty good photos and so does the front camera. You can download overdrive media and get e books audio books from the library for free. Also the device is pretty durable. Overall I really liked this product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I adore this tablet! I've owned it for a few months now and rely on it constantly. It has replaced my iPad, my iPod, my GPS, and in many ways my desktop PC. I love the freedom it provides me as a mobile user - the freedom to read just about any file format through one app or other, the freedom to access the file system, and the freedom to make changes to the device in ways that Android supports. This device is always at my side.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this tablet for my father in law who really love it.Its a great wifi tablet and come on, for the price, what do you expect? it's simply greatThe new Android its very very amazing, you can do anything you want, download tons of apps and personalize your own tablet.Very fast to do many works and search the web.Small but with a perfect and brightness screen.Skype works really fine and i love the cam and the effects you can give to your photos.I think Samsung must sell a version with 3G but its ok this model with only wifi.Really really recommended to everybody.Compre esta tablet para mi suegro que la necesitaba para el trabajo y quedo fascinado.Android es genial, con muchisimas aplicaciones para descargar tanto gratis como pagas y con muchas posibilidades para personalizar tu tablet, lo cual es perfecto para manejarla a tu antojo y con las cosas que realmente importan.La velocidad es muy buena, una notable diferencia con modelos anteriores y compitiendo con el ipad 2.Skype, mercadolibre, ebay, amazon, juegos, las apps corren bastante fluidas y te permiten hacer varias cosas al mismo tiempo.La camara es muy buena, con multiples efectos y motivos para escojer, asi que para fanaticos de estar tomando fotos a cada rato, la van a disfrutar.Esta tabler a pesar de ser peque&ntilde;a es perfecta para usarla comodamente y no ocupa mucho espacio ni se te hace engorrosa trasladarla o escribir.Creo que deberian sacar de una vez una version con 3g de esta tablet asi incremente un poco el precio, pero seria muy superior al promedio del mercado.La recomiendo para todos, ya que tiene posibilidades de ser aprovechada por estudiantes, profesionales, fanaticos de la tecnologia, ni&ntilde;os, etc.

I would def. rec. this tab to any1

tablet_galaxy_tab|I love it so much i want to marry it. This is everything and more from a tablet. This is the tech lovers version of the fire. I have been reading on it since I got it and its just great. All the games I played on my phone our huge and more enjoyable. It arrived in just 2 days. So far its great.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought a kindle fire for my wife and she had problem with viewing online movies from other sites than netflix or amazon and main problem was the games she loves to play with. Other languages displays messy in the kindle fire.I returned it and bought this one. She loves it. That is enough for me. Also you can edit MS documents in this tablet which is plus from my side.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Purchased this tablet from my mother for her birthday and ended up getting my wife one for Mother's Day. The ease of use paired with the expandable memory and ICS make this a fun tablet to use. Also I feel you get the most bang for your buck. The camera is not the greatest but we rarely use the on board camera for anything other than quick video chats. The other thing that I like about this tablet is there is not a lot of fluff app preloaded. The only drawback is the lack of aftermarket products available for the Tab 2 7.0. we have resorted to using a Kindle portfolio until a decent case is put on the market.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this tablet. I don't know all the fancy terms for what it does, but I do know that it works great! I had a tablet before,and this surpasses it. I like the camera just fine. It took great pictures that captured moments and the pictures were loved by family members I shared them with.This will not replace my digital camera, but honestly, I feel like I take better pictures with the tab. Hmmmm, something for me to ponder.I love the size of the tablet. I often feel overloaded with the stuff i carry with me and this fits in just fine with my downsized bag. It is the perfect size for browsing online news sites at lunch, looking up knitting stuff, or using as a remote at home.Speaking of remotes, the tablet is a great remote. I have the RoByte app installed to control our Roku streaming player. I also use the pre installed Peel app to control my TV's and DVD player. This is a godsend for a household that always misplaces remotes.The display is sharp and clear. Netflix and YouTube run well with lovely clarity. My pictures look great and detailed. I have downloaded the kindle reader along with the apps for kobo and the nook readers. I have a kindle touch for regular books, but looking at instructional books in color is awesome. Just awesome.The sound is clear, did not get tinny when turned up.I would recommend this for anyone looking for a sleek, but solid tablet that is compact enough so that you don't feel weighed down.And the price...I can't believe how much bang i got for my buck.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Fantastic product. It's cheap, if compared to other tablets, but it's powerful. It has an excellent screen, with a good resolution and bright colors. Its dimensions and its lightness make it a perfect choice for who wants to read ebooks. You can bring it everywhere easily. Strongly recommended.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have been using my tab for a couple of days now and I have absolutely no regrets! The OS runs smoothly and within a matter of minutes I was able to synchronize to my Google accounts and download some of my favorite Android apps from Google Play. The quality of the camera is OK - I didn't really expect an overly sophisticated one for a tablet in this range. All in all this tablet has great value for its price!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was really amazed how the technology being changed so fast. The Galaxy Tab2 is not only easy to use, as well as nice looking. I liked from the very first moment. It's functionality and features, "Awesome" !!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased the Tab 2 for my fianc&eacute; and she absolutely loves it! Quality construction, feels good in the hands, and has an AWESOME screen! She uses it for reading e-books, checking email and searching the web. Very fast, very intuitive, and EXCELLENT battery life. I did extensive research on Tablets, Netbooks and E-readers, before making this purchase and for the money, I feel that this is the best device on the market for what you get. Buy it! You won't regret it! BTW..."ICS" is just "icing" on the cake!...smile...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Excellent product! Long battery life, good performance! Smaller size means more convenient to bring with you! Definitely worth buying! Recommended!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I've had my Tab for about 3 days now and so far I'm very pleased with it. I also wish I had waited until it came out instead of buying a Nook Color last year (before the Nook Tablet was introduced). For the most part I like the look and feel of the Ice Cream OS. The preloaded widgets are useful too.So far my only quibble is that the I restricted to placing my icons within a limited area of my home screens. There's over an inch of space inaccessible at the top and bottom of the screens. And I can't move icons between home screens as easily as I can on my phone. That said, I'm still learning so there may be functionality that will allow for those things that I haven't discovered yet.Again...so far so good.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm still learning about the device but its fun discovering what else it can do. Can't wait to master it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|We were surprised by the ease of operation on the tablet. Didn't take very long to learn how to use it for the things we wanted to do on it. Great compact size makes it easy to take along with us and has provided hours of entertainment.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|We purchased this for our ten year old as a Christmas gift. It is a really nice tablet and reasonably priced. He uses it every day; it was definitely the right tablet for him. It's a nice size for him to take places or use in the car during travel. He really enjoys it; it's become a favorite!I would recommend this for an adult too. I like it a lot and wish I had one!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|love it so much closet I would buy again and again and again so great for Samsung to come out the
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Excelente servicio, rapido y sin novedad todo llego como lo esperaba y ahora paso muchas horas y en cualquier lugar con mi tablet, recomendado 100% el vendedor ... =)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I received the tablet two days later. I am still learning how to work the tablet, but I love it. It's small enough to fit in my clutch or pocket.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I dont know all the technology mumbo jumbo, but after reading enough reviews I was convinced that this was a great product for my price range. Ive hafd it now for 2 months and am very happy with my purchase. The only thing I would suggest to anyone buying this is to make sure it is set up to work with whatever wireless service u have already. I tried to add it to my verizon plan to have internet outside the house and found out its incompatible. Oh well.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Haven' had a bunch of time to play with the Galaxy but I am looking forward to it soon. Thank you.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My daughter bought this for herself with her Christmas money and she absolutely loves it. At first it was a little complex and she was confused with the functionality and high tech features, but she is very attached to it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Awesome quality, great price (especially with the charger actually being included with the tablet... unlike other models *coughs: Kindle Fire*). Got it for my Mum as a long overdue replacement and we're happy to report 5 star operating capacity.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really enjoy this little tablet. For the price it is very usable, but don't compare this to the speed of an Apple iPad MD328LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, White) NEWEST MODEL. That's not fair, and this little puppy is about $300 less expensive. But at the same time, I would be remiss in saying this meets all my hopes and expectations for a tablet. It's a bit slow... now don't get me wrong, it's usable, but screens don't snap into place quite as promptly as... say an iPad, or even the Samsung Galaxy Tab (10.1-Inch, 16GB, Wi-Fi), but once again, we're talking about a $200 price difference. So what would be a good comparison in the same price range? How about this other tablet that I bought at Costco for $190 (actually three): VIZIO 8-Inch Tablet with WiFi - VTAB1008. The Samsung is noticeably faster than the Vizio. Plus Ice Cream Sandwich is a very intuitive operating system for this tablet... far easier to use than the Vizio... sometimes I'm clicking on the [Back] button on the Vizio several times, because there is no response and no visual indication that it has been selected then I go back several screens at a time. Not good for the Vizio, but the Samsung, there is a visual selection and you return immediately. The 7" screen is very readable, and I prefer the smaller size (compared to the 8" Vizio). I would recommend the Samsung to anyone with a desire for an entry level tablet, but do not expect a lot of speed.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I ordered this from Amazon this past Wednesday and received it the next day. Plugged it into the charger to let it get the battery "filled up" and then proceeded to get it set up. Not being familiar with the tablet menu system, it took me a few minutes to learn how to get it going, but once I did, it was pretty amazing. It asked for my Gmail ID and then proceeded to synchronize with my Samsung Fascinate cell phone and my Google data on my home computer via the common wireless connection they share.One of the first things I did was to test out Google Voice for the first time. It worked like a champ, wow...free phone calls now. I decided to try Google's Chrome browser (which is in beta test now) and it came right up. It synchronized my Bookmarks from my home computer system, and it works great. I tried a few of my favorite games, and they are just as I knew they would be, GREAT!!My wife is uses her Kindle Fire as her living room laptop and electronic book reader (Kindle) and once she sees how much more responsive (and predictable) this new Samsung 7" Tab with ICS is, she will want one too.Samsung, I am impressed, no kidding, this "puppy" is a true WINNER!!!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I've been "shopping" for a tablet for several months. I've read all about and looked at several different models and sizes. At first I thought I wanted a 10 inch screen, but after much consideration I decided that a 7 inch screen would be much more compact and easy to take with me when I leave home. Mostly am interested in reading books, playing a few games, checking my email and being able to connect the tablet to a USB cord to view photos and move things to my external hard drive. A couple of weeks ago, I saw an ad for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. The selling points for me, other than it had the ability to do all the things I just mentioned, were the reviews by people who had purchased this tablet. I decided to go for it, bought it and am very satisfied with it. I do agree with a previous reviewer that it feels like "a bar of soap" when you hold it, so I immediately ordered a safe and secure cover that has all the correct holes for the ports needed. I purchased the ROOCASE (Leather Case Cover with stand for Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus) from Amazon. I also purchased a car charger that has the ability to charge my smart phone and my tablet at the same time. I haven't received the charger yet, but will review it when I try it out.I'm very satisfied with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 - 7.0 and highly recommend it for folks looking for a compact tablet with easy to use features.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet was released in a time when the market was hungry for a cheap-yet-decent tablet experience. You were either stuck buying a crappy Vizio (or other value brand) tablet, the locked-down Kindle Fire, or spending huge wads of cash on a 10-inch device that was clumsy and bulky to hold. Samsung apparently saw the market niche and jumped on it.This is not a premium tablet. Instead it's targeted at people who want a "good enough" tablet experience while keeping a reasonable price point. There's some tasks the tablet is "good enough" for, and other tasks that some people might find lacking.I primarily use this thing to read books and watch YouTube and Netflix in bed. The 7-inch screen is totally suitable when your face is close to it (much less eye-strain than trying to watch extended video playback on the 4-inch screen of a smartphone). I've spent many blissfully relaxed hours watching stuff on this tablet, with the added ego boost of knowing it's much more electrically efficient than watching the same content on my desktop computer.Less frequently I use the tablet for listening to music (media players are a joy to use on the bigger-than-a-smartphone screen, with the album art showing up huge and pretty), web browsing (Google News and articles on various sites), online chat (through IRC an client), and all the other uses you'd expect to get out of an Android device. Email, social networks, image browsing, screwing around with the camera for the lulz, etc etc etc.There are a two minor flaws I've noticed. The stock web browser seems a bit laggy and buggy at times and the music player occasionally suffers brief hiccups in playback, though this may have been fixed in a software update, as I haven't heard this problem recently. On that note, Samsung has been supporting this product really well. For the 3-4 months since I've gotten it, I think the device has received.... five software updates? It's always nice to see a manufacturer standing behind a product post-sale.So, the verdict. It's not a premium device, but it is excellent for the price, and good enough for my tablet needs. Even as it's made depreciated by newer 7-inch tablets, I plan on using it and loving it for a long time yet.

tablet_galaxy_tab|First; I want to say this was an impulse purchase at Best Buy. Sorry Amazon. I doubt I would have purchased it without the opportunity to try it out first. I also don't usually purchase items like this without reading some customer reviews and researching them a little. That being said; I am more than pleased with my purchase. I am going on my third week of owning it and have no complaints. Everything exceeds my expectations. The Tab 2 came preloaded with a wide variety of Apps and has the ability to download and install Apps for just about anything you could want to do on it. It comes with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) OS already installed. While I haven't explored all of its functions yet; the ones that I have work great. The memory can be upgraded to 32GB with a Micro SD card; I recommend SanDisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC Card Plus Adapter (SDSDQUA-032G-U46A). I bought mine from Amazon for $29.94 (USD). You can download and watch movies, stream movies from NetFlix, download books and apps from the Kindle store, retrieve and send e-mail, use the organizer app to keep track of appointments, etc. etc. Did I mention you can download an app for just about anything you want to do on this tablet? You can sync your music, video, pictures, and contacts from your computer using the Samsung Kies Software. A word to the wise, download and install the Samsung USB drivers BEFORE you install the Kies software and connect your Tab 2. If not you are going to have problems. I learned the hard way. The battery life is excellent. The WiFi connection is a breeze to setup. I bought the eWonder(R) Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Case for 7" Samsung Galaxy Tab PLUS and the New Galaxy Tab 2 (Black) from Amazon for my tablet and it was also a breeze to setup and connect. I would recommend this tablet highly to anyone; even it is your first. If you require any more technical details go to [...]

tablet_galaxy_tab|When the Tab 2 7.0 came out it looked wonderful. Feature packed with Android 4, cameras, SD card slot (important but missing on many tablets), GPS, Google Maps, etc. and the tablet itself has lived up to its promise but Samsung unfortunately has not. I have become well acquanted with their customer service and the people are great but seem to have spotty training. It is like the "little girl with the curl".When it became evident that their Bluetooth instance had trouble pairing with a number of common devices (on access would give constant pairing requests), at first they denied the problem & said it was the adapter, then they were working on it. Finally two months after it was reported, ICS 4.0.4 came out and it was fixed.Except no-one told the service desk just as no-one told them that Allshare had been moved from a seperate app to part of settings. This is bad because from day one HDMI support had been promised except it needed an unobtainable adapter. Then it was said one of their adapters would work except it doesn't. Samsung's latest move is to redact the reference to HDMI from their specifications and user guide (is in revs up to 3, not in rev 7. Page 22). Lawyers have a word for this.So if it does what you need out of the box or with an available adapter then you are fine but if something you expected to work (like the Sat-Nav seems to need WiFi/3G access to calculate driving directions but the GPS itself seems powerful) is "different" or is in the specs but does not seem to be there (like being able to connect to an external display), good luck.In any case, be kind to the service desk people, they are trying to do the right thing.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had this tablet for 3 months now. I'm gonna start with the bad because i'm a negative individual. =) Ok the app store for this device has little support. Especially with Gameloft and some other high end games. This more has to do with the play store in general but buying an app to find out it doesn't work and hopefully staying with in the 15 minute window so that you can return the app is a pain. Sometimes it takes 20 minutes or more just for the app to recognize the program as being payed for and not stolen so it will take you 20+ minutes just to start the app and then you have to hassle with the developer. That's something apple got right. Other then that the device runs smooth and fast. Everything is easy to use. With all the complaints about the app store i love how laid back the app store is. I have an ipod and never had an android so i'm surprised at the apps that are aloud on there without needing an exploit. Again that's the app store and not the device. The tablet is very sturdy. I like that they used plastic and not metal and glass. Metal gets cold and glass is dangerous as well as breaks easily. plastic is soft and i would think it's better if it were dropped. It also won't shatter into dangerous shards. I don't use the camera but i heard it sucked. I have an actual camera so i don't need it. The speakers are very loud. It has great screen brightness which is also easy to access. In fact everything is very easy to access. A big problem though like anything that doesn't bare the name apple on it is that the accessories are hard to come buy. I mean if you see a sign in a store that says mp3 player you know what that really means... iPod. anyways all in all this is a great device for the price tag and i think it's also a perfect size as well.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I love, love, LOVE my Galaxy Tab 2. I got it mainly to be able to watch Netflix on my back porch, but it does so much more, it's really fun. The other day, my cable provider released an Android app, so now I can watch cable TV on my tab too! I hesitated between the 7 inch and 10 inch, but I'm glad I got the 7 inch. The screen is super-sharp and bright, and the 7 inch is easy to carry, easy to prop up in the stand, it's perfect. Here's a tip though, get one of the 360 degree rotating cases, it's really worthwhile to be able to stand it up either landscape for movie watching or portrait for book reading. Yes, you can get the Kindle and Nook apps for it too. What's not to like?
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|A distinguishing feature on the Galaxy Tab 7 inch that most of the lower price tablets do not have is an SD card slot. This allows one to expand the storage capacity pracitically infinitely. You can drag and drop pictures, documents, and videos from your laptop onto the memory card and then put the memory card back into your Galaxy Tab and view these files immediately without having to go through any other software program. You just click on the folder that says "ext SD Card" and start viewing. It is definitely worth the extra cost.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|If you read ebooks and mobility is important, i recommend this. For example, using a 10 inch in a crowdy bus while standing would be very hard. 7 inches is a good size for single handed use. It's also lighter.If mobility is not important, you might want to check out devices with bigger screen.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I like my samsung very much, I wish I could download older tv programs on it, Haven't figured it out alot though, I will

tablet_galaxy_tab|Very nice tablet, seems plenty fast and not too slow booting either. Nice screen, great apps, good wifi... Who could want more for this price! I would indeed recommend this as a starter for the wife any day!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I just love how easy it is to work it and to go into different sites too. I even bought one for my husband and a sibling..
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|my only regret is that i didn't buy another one for my wife so she doesn't have to keep borrowing it from me

tablet_galaxy_tab|I was debating over what to get for my 8 year old daughter to use so she can get off my laptop. Apple products are way too overpriced so I nixed that. My kids play on my GS3 all the time so I know they'd be comfortable using an Android. She loves this little tablet, fits comfortably in her hands, she mainly plays games and watch videos on it. Has pretty good battery life. She played games and watched videos on youtube and it only ate up about 30%. This is a great tablet for cost and functionality.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i was wanting a tablet for a long time so i settled on the samsung galaxy tab 2 7.0. i love it its the perfect size not too big not to small. I use it mainly for apps and web searching and media. the battery last up to two days with moderate use. the cpu is plenty fast for web,games and media its the perfect device!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this. I am not very computer savy, and this is easy to work with. I skype with my grand son and it is nice to be able to chat with him where ever i go.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am, and have always been an Android lover, but this brings that love to another level. So fast, so sturdy, works great no matter what. So in love :-)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was caught between the Kindle and the Galaxy tab. I opted for the Galaxy tab and I'm very pleased with my choice. It's a great tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought several of these for my grandchildren at Christmas. They love them. They use them every day. we keep in touch with messaging on them. One gift I would buy over and over again.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have a thing for S.Korea (haha, not in a weird way, just the language and music,and guys &#62;.&#60;), so I know about Samsung, and have known about it since Kiddie-hood.It's a very good brand. And, I like their sass! (The whole Fruit company law-debate-y).Back to the Tablet! I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE IT! I can do about anything on this that I can do on a computer and then some! Of course, I still prefer a laptop for certain things, as the internet was mad for computers ( as dull as I may sound) and I'm more comfortable with a computer's keyboard and bigger screen. But I love my tablet! I've named it Seungri aka the Panda maknae! I can watch shows, play games, do homework! Check and write emails, edit pictures, documents, music, YOU NAME IT!Never let your tablet's power fall below 15%, it can affect battery life. Though I read, somewhere, it's good to let it die completely every 3 months or something. (DO NOT quote me on that however!). If you're putting your baby away leave it with a life of 50-75%. This prevents it from going into deep hibernation, which may cause it to never turn back on!Read all this on the Fruit company site.I'd recommend this to anyone!Androids are great, many MANY free apps (permissions are a bastard though) and they give you free music like almost every week. Mi likey!Got mine early March. Will let you know if it goes bye bye anytime soon, and who's gonna pay!Oh, also, it's best to turn your tablet OFF when it's charging, and remove it from any cases that MAY hold onto heat and cause the tab to charge ineffectively.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|worked as advertized, only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't have a USB port and of course they never mention that it cant be used without also buying an adapter. and even then a mouse would not work with the tablet. but it does work well with wifi and the battery lasts a long time.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|For this price am happy, added a Otterbox so my 2 yr old wont bust it.Havent found any cons yet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Tab is great. Very fast shipping. Works well...easy hold in hand and great for school work...typing will need getting used to
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It was just what I was expecting. Plus it came right on time. I used to own a pandigital and i must say that it was a very frustrating device to use. It wouldn't update its firmware and hence it gave me problems. But this Samsung tab made me a believer again. I'm a satisfied customer.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|AWESOME!! the product was more than i imagined. i am happt to have purchased this item. it came even before i expected it to!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I HAVE OWNED SEVERAL TABLETS, THIS ONE IS BY FAR SUPERIOR TO ANY I HAVE OWNED. i WOULD LIKE IT EVEN MORE IF IT WAS THE 4G LTE VERSION
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have a ipad 2 that is heavy when trying to read books so I thought I'd get something smaller. The ipad mini is too expensive so I thought I'd try an android tablet. Love this thing! I can read for hours without my arm getting tired. I can customize the tab a lot better than the ipad which is nice. The google store has an abundance of apps which is nice. For the price can't beat it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|IT MAKES LIFE A BIT EASIER WITH THE RESPONSIBILITIES I HAVE WITHIN MY WORKPLACE AND PERSONAL LIFE. ITS VERY AWESOME
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet replaced my kindle fire and I can already tell that it is more powerful in performance and speed.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|looks good, like the camera, smooth performance, not the latest OS but it's actual, i have already the nexus 7 , and the diference is big but this one do the job
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Took him a while to get used to it because he's not all that tech savvy, but now he uses it a lot for multiple purposes. When one of us is away, it works great as a Skype tablet to take from room to room and talk as we go!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|LOVE THE TABLET - STILL LEARNING HOW TO USE IT MORE EFFECIENTLY - I NEED TO REMEMBER THAT I HAVE IT AND FORGET TAKING MY LAPTOP SO MUCH
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have only had the product for a day but so far it is quite nice. I would recommend this to a friend.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this product for a good price. Even though we don't use it to often it has always been great when we do use it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Absolutely love my new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. Never leave home without it.. Been one of the better refurb products I have bought. Best part is it was able to upgrade to Jellybean 4.1.1!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this tablet mainly for fun~for me and our 6 year old daughter! It turns out we are having more fun than we ever could have expected! It takes really nice video and pictures and our daughter loves that she can access everything with just the touch of the button! She's been playing games, listening to music...for the price, it's PERFECT for what we needed!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|for the price I paid its an awesome tablet, I love it, I bring it everywhere, no wifi no problem, I use my phone wifi tetheringto connect, the battery last pretty long, dont have to charge it every 2 days, depends how much you use it, but overall I'm happy with the purchase and shipping, I got it in like 3 days :)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|New to the table game. This works great. Easy setup with my Wi-Fi. Use to reading regular books. So, I'm still learning to use this.Tested it to see if plays AVI does & great picture. Was able to get a lot of books. but couldn't read them until I got the app readers to read epub.mobi & cbr from Google play store (installed on this unit). Definetly Buy the external Micro card (32gb), I got the Kingston Digital 32 GB microSDHC for $21 here. Only thing I thing should have been better designed was where the Micro Card goes into Tab. Hard to get out without fingernails or tweezers - being a guy I don't have long fingernails. Glad Ialways carry my small leatherman El that has the tweezers.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|its working. it lovel and its easy to travel with.. it picks up the wifi as it turned on, m getting use to it i reall love it and would recommend it to anyone anytime.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The best android tab ever. i'm in love with it :-)baterry is killing and screen is amazing and so simple to use..
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|For ~$200, you can't get a better tablet.Pros:1. Expandable memory2. IR blaster (unbelievably useful)3. Contrary to my expectations, the Touchwhiz UI adds value to Android and the bundled apps are useful. the tablet is ready to use right out of the box, unlike the Nexus 74. Jelly Bean!5. Good battery life6. USB on the go! I could basically every USB peripheral, mouse, keyboard and thumb drivesCons:1. At 370gms, it's slightly on the heavier side for people wanting to use it as an eBook reader2. Screen is low-res which matters on a text-heavy webpage/app3. Slow processor, but has sufficient RAM to cater to most modern games4. No HDMI out to mirror the display on to a TV, but supports dlnaOverall, I'm very pleased with it for the price paid.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my husband who is very into the tablets right now. We've been shopping for months and looking at so many kinds. I ran into this one on Amazon by accident - I can't remember what I was looking for - but this popped up. SO glad it did!We got this in 2 days - awesome super fast shipping by Amazon!My husband charged this as soon as it got here and was able to get on it and start going crazy within a few hours. He absolutely LOVE this Samsung Galaxy Tablet! He says it's super fast, easy to follow - not a bad thing to say.This is DEFINITELY worth the money. He was actually going to get the Kindle Fire but he now says this is so much better and he's thrilled with it - so I guess I did good!I'll update after he's had it for a little while so you'll know if he still likes it. I surely recommend it though!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Just wish I could stream my Prime videos over this device. I will have to look at Netflix or Hulu for videos. Any chance this will change? Other wise it has met all my needs. Better price then the Apple iPad. Color and response is super even though it is not HD. My daughter got one too
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My brother got his for Christmas and he loved it so much he doesn't even touch his iPod any more.Then he took it to are uncle house and my aunt and two cousins wanted one to.Eventually they got it and everytime I see them now there always on it .The graphic are great runs really fast and the camera is great.If your looking for a 7inch tablet this is your best pick.I went with the nexus 7 I like it a lot more its also a great 7inch tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|great lil tablet. fits in my handbag. i have had it now since dec. and not 1 issue.plus the graphics are outstanding.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Was working ok for first three months, stopped going online three days ago....Update...Been on the phone with Samsung.... tried factory reset... Still not able to go online....
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Everything I was looking for in a tablet, a very fine product. I am considering the 10.1 tablet for my next purchase.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have owned 2 ipods and 1 iphone, and this is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better. Well its bigger with more options and i am just tired of apple's software so i switched to android. Just the simple fact that i can download music is a plus. Im overseas and have been for the last 3 years. One of my ipods was lost in Amsterdam(long story). but apple products are durable so i have to see how this galaxy will hold up. The only downfall so far is that i dont have a flash for the camera so i dont think i will be able to get a flashlight app. Anyway my first week of use has been great, fast download speed, doesnt freeze alot, and picture perfect resolution. Skype is clearer my 4th gen. ipod so far. I will update, in about a month.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was looking for something to replace an old laptop that I used for watching movies and checking email while I am away from home, and this does all that I need...and more. This little tab is large enough to watch movies, but I do recommend headphones. The speakers are good...but you won't get really decent sound without headphones or external speakers.It's fast, at least fast enough for a guy who just wants to do a little surfing, check email, and watch movies. Of course, you can play pretty much all the apps/games you can find for an Android device, which just adds to the value of this handy little device.The one thing I did find, is that I can't play java based poker that requires interaction with the website...it may be that the flash isn't up to date or I need to install something else, but sites like NLOP or Cafrino won't work with this straight out of the box. I don't play often, but I do like those sites when I do play. I'd like to figure out if it's possible to play on this tablet.Other than that, I'm really happy I made this purchase. I ended up buying the Blurex case for this, and like it alot...it was cheap, and does the job.If you want access to all the Android apps from the Google Play store, you need to get this tab and leave the Kindle stuff alone.

tablet_galaxy_tab|So far its been great, pictures great surfing, great, blue tooth connected to my Blue Tooth creative portable speaker sounds fantastic. I will add to this later

tablet_galaxy_tab|With a recent price drop on this tablet I sprang for it. Not from Amazon but from a local retailer. I have had it for just a couple days so I am developing some opinions about the product. So far my opinion is favorable.I have a lot of experience with Windows computers, iphones, android phones, iPods, and iPads so I thought long and hard about my choices before I bought it. I like the speed of the device and the open nature of Android versus the highly proprietary world of Apple.Here comes the surprise...I have been an Amazon Prime member for a few years and enjoy the Instant Video portion of my membership. Naturally I searched the Google play store for an app to view my Instant Videos and found none. A little more research revealed that There is an app for the iPad and iPod. One for Roku, and of course, you can watch them on a computer. I found that the Kindle Fire allows the feature to be used. Being Android based it was on my list of tablets to consider but it lacks the open support of the Galaxy Tab and does not have the expandability of the Tab.I hope this review helps you when you consider this device.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Its good, its a no sim wi-fi only. The product was good. New Android version already installed.Note: Whatsapp does not work on Wi-Fi only

tablet_galaxy_tab|The only thing was the packaging.... The sticker seal was ripped. And it also says that if the seal was broken I should not accept it. But it was a gift I gave to someone and I don't have a chance to return or exchange it. I hope it was some accident that caused it. And I hope they did not give me a refurbished one... :/ But all in all, this tablet is the best one yet!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought two of the Samsung Tablets 7.0 because I bought myself the 10.1 version and I love it and my kids loves theirs. This a great product.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Lovvvvve this one. great interface. works smoothly. fits perfectly in my palm and adds a touch of professionalism when i go to meetings.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I've only used it for one day, but this is lots of fun. The only drawback is that for a 7" tablet, it is darn heavy! It took me an updated install of Netflix to get it to work without an error message of minimum requirements, but once rolling the video quality is great. It has a very similar feel to my Samsung Galaxy phone, so I was able to have a comfortable feel for using it from the start. I am a little concerned over the log in of apps such as Yahoo e-mail as I haven't been able to figure out how to log out. It appears they stay logged in (except Netflix which you can log out of). Will have to read up on it as I am concerned about security issues. The Android Market is readily available and I was able to download my favorite games without problem. Accessing Amazon Kindle books was also easy and it was great actually being able to see the book covers instead of just a list which is what my husband sees on his Kindle Touch. I was disappointed in the camera quality, but had to remember that 1.3 mp is mediocre in comparison to my phone which is 8 mp. Also, there is no flash, but no real surprise there. The video quality more than makes up for it. So far I am pleased as I was looking for a "mini computer" I could tote in my purse...might just be a little more hefty than I was expecting. Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi) Update: I have now been using the tablet for about a week and I must stay I am really enjoying it. It truly is like a mini computer as I can readily access the internet. I can see there are many more features I need to become familiar with, but overall I am very pleased. I inserted an SD card for the first time and did learn it is a good idea to turn the tablet off, insert the card, then turn it back on. Using the Settings feature doesn't seem to work if you inser the card while the tablet is on. It then instantly recognizes the card and makes it easy to access. You definitely need to get an exterior SD disk as the 4 MB interior memory card will fill up quickly with photos, games, video, etc. I am not a big fan of "i-"anything (i-pad, i-pod, etc.), so I can recommend the Samsung which seems more user friendly and accessible as far as available apps and other programs.

tablet_galaxy_tab|After receiving some comments, i thought I might be too hard on my review and I think a 4 stars looks more appropiateHowever the battery life is really an issue you should considered_________________________&lt;______________________________________&lt;______Having my galaxy 3 weeks now I can tell I am satisfied so far.First consideration this is a 250 bucks tablets, so don't expect a high end device, I own an iPad 2, iPod touch, so I guess I can tell you my reason to buy a Galaxy tab 2 ICS.First of all, I was tired of the size of my iPad 2 and weight, I wanted to have a small tablet just to watch movies and Internet while lay down in bed, after an hour movies, iPad 2 weight becomes an issue to hold it one hand.Since I travel often to Europe, I wanted to have a VPN tablet, so that's the only reason I didn't go for a Kindle Fire.GThe VPN is so easy to set in this tablet, it's same as easy as Ipad2. The only thing is that Netflix sometimes freezes and a reboot is required, not big deal, but that doesn't happen on iPad 2 neither iPod touch.The home screen is really remarkable, you can personalise it, and you can have a small screenshot or the most recent videos in you tube, bookmarks from your navigation, news etc, very nice.From the apps side, Android have more and better quality apps than Apple,for instance you can find complete free version of UNO card game, that doesn't have IOS, you have Hulu Plus, which doesn't run in IOS, neither exploring site with adobe plug in (great).The setting quick access from the bar very convenient, the reader for e book is good and also the remote control feature is awesome, especially if you have a Samsung tv.The only reason I dont't give it a 4 stars are:Battery life is too short, even saving putting wifi off, the battery drains after 2 hours of gaming and video vs iPad 2 which the battery really last 4 hours at that use rate?the other thing is that tapping is not so great as iPad, you miss a lot letters, the system seems to not recognised the proper spots of each buttons, I don't know if this is an Ice cream sandwich issue but is a pain.In conclusion I'm very satisfied, since from the beginning I was clear about what I wanted, a cheaper tablet for Internet and movies with VPN feature, I didn't expect to have a GPS and a slot memory expansion which are plus, but if you want to use a tablet for more complex task you should go for other brands such as apple or toshiba or asus

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought mine at Best Buy. Performance is good, price was right (or so I thought). Everything is good except for one important aspect (for me): With Android 4, the SD card is not good for anything but storing data. This means you can't move your apps to the SD card. The internal storage is 8GB but after formatting and the operating system, you're left with a little over half of the internal storage remaining. While you may put a thousand small apps on the internal storage, the quantity goes down drastically if you load larger apps and their associated data. For example, the navigation app is larger than, say, a slot machine game, and the map data can be huge if you want to have a bunch of states loaded. I'm not sure if the map data can be moved to the SD card and have the app know where to find it or not. There are no instructions about how to use the space.Samsung should have pushed Google to enable moves to SD card like the earlier versions of Android supported, or provided more internal storage. And at least make it known to a potential buyer about this limitation.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great little tablet! Its super responsive, snappy, and does everything I want it to do. This is the perfect mix of portability and functionality. Works great as an e-reader also, plays movies locally, and on netflix great. Love the Peel Smart Remote app also!Great tablet, and great company to purchase from (Data Vision)... though they shipped it via Fedex which sucks, but thats not their fault.

tablet_galaxy_tab|For background I am currently trying to unload my Kindle Fire and have recently purchased this Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 tablet from a large retailer which sounds sounds similiar to rosco! They had a bundle package with the tablet sleeve included for $239 (few bucks more than Amazon price after tax but you do get a 90 day exchange).I have to say so far I am very impressed with this samsung tablet. Its very responsive to the touch seems very fast for what I need it for and the weight is great. I had the Kindle Fire and I enjoyed it but I do like having access to the Google Market and figured if I need to read books I can always use the Kindle app for android which works very well. I will say the first samsung tablet I picked up I found a few "lit" pixels which showed up when using a black background. I took it back to the store and repurchased another one and so far I do not see the same issue.I think the camera even though its getting a bad reputation still is nice since the Fire does not even have one. I don't see myself out taking snapshots with this thing but sometimes its nice having it and I might try Skype on it at some point. So far the wifi has worked great, I downloaded about 800mb of music over iSyncr Wifi the other nite along with downloading apps from the google market and did not notice hardly any slow down. I think for the money this is gonna be a great tablet. I currently have an ipad 1st gen, Touchpad rooted with Android and a KFire. I think this may be the tablet that wins out for travel and just couch browsing. Love the form factor.5/3/12-------------------------------Just an update tried a couple of the galaxy tab 2 cases and not really liking any of them. Blurex leather slim folio case is ok, but I did not like how the case is when in the open position, doesnt lay flat. The other one I tried is the MoKo 360 degree rotating case, which the concept is great, but the back of it seems rather large since it has the swivel functionality. Probably going to send all of these back. Just for fun I snapped in the galaxy tab 2 inside my old Kindle Fire case the (Ace Flip Case by Casecrown) and it fits perfect. (http://www.amazon.com/CaseCrown-Black-Smoke-Amazon-Kindle/dp/B005VR5034/ref=sr_1_9?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1336087216&sr=1-9 ). Now of course there is no camera hole in the back but all the other ports are fully accessible and this cases still allows you to pop out the corner to position the galaxy tab in landscape mode for reading. They also lay very flat when open which is nice when reading, etc. Just a thought if someone is looking for a cheaper case (no rear camera hole).

tablet_galaxy_tab|I had this tablet for 4 months. I hardly use it. I have my 3yr old daughter play with it. It always freezes and the apps keep glitching. I think its a software problem. It won't play videos on the browser either. Last night it did not want to charge and kept asking for a software update. I accepted the update it erased all my settings etc. It asked for another update 5 minutes later and I accepted but this time it froze. Eventually the battery died and I'm not surprised.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is the best tablet for its price and ability. I Got this Tablet for my birthday and have had this tablet since it came out on Amazon. It is a great tablet at a amazing price. I take it everywhere. It is like my baby I never leave the house without it and its always by my side. The Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 is Awesome.All it took was one time to hook up WiFi and it was on without no problems and stays connected. Even though its only got a few bars sometimes it still works Great. I think its Better then the Kindle Fire but that's my opinion.It is a great product and is fast. I do recommend this device to anyone that wants %100 Satisfaction. It is about the same size as Samsung Galaxy plus and fits some same cases/covers. This Device is AWESOME !!! GREAT JOB SAMSUNG

tablet_galaxy_tab|I like others have stated in reviews was going to buy the Nook Tablet, but waited for this one.I have an iPad (3rd Gen) which I could never use because my 9 year old was on it all the time. I decided to get her a device of her own. It's perfect size for a kid's hands. Setup was easy, the ICS software is great, excellent screen etc.Here's the caveat:The Google play store, has no parental controls, unlike Apple, and no way to set up an allowance for my kid, also unlike Apple. Also, you don't have to enter any password to download an app?The upside, is I get an email whenever an app is downloaded, whether it costs anything or not.I've had to lay down the law and tell my daughter that if I see an Email regarding an app that I haven't told her is ok.I have no idea if such parental controls exist on the Nook or Fire, but I wish Android had themThis is my ONLY issue with the tablet and I'm very happy with my purchase.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Let me start off by saying, I am an Android fan. I own a Samsung Galaxy S II phone and am eagerly looking forward to buying the S IV once it is out. So, when I got the Galaxy Tab 2 (7 inch) in a deal on purchase of Samsung 46-inch Smart LED TV I was pretty excited about it. However, upon using it for a day or so, I had no choice but to return it for a refund.The Wi-Fi receiver is extremely defective. It needs the signal to be at full strength to open web pages. If the signal drops even to 3/4th of full strength, it won't open the lightest of web pages (e.g. Google). It will simply show "loading" and will eventually time-out. I did some research of my own and found a number of hits for "Galaxy Tab 2 Weak Wi-Fi", one of the first links is actually an Amazon link: http://www.amazon.com/Did-they-ever-fix-WiFi/forum/Fx2OE7QX73W89HA/Tx2WVDVZLKXZDGM/1?asin=B007P4VOWC and the answer to that question is NO. Then you have the "death grip" issue - hold the tab on the bottom left corner (where the Wi-Fi antenna is located) and see the signal strength drop before your eyes. I even tried following some of the suggestions which point to adding the Wi-Fi network manually instead of auto-detect and that did not help either.Finally, I had to call up Amazon tech support, who were very helpful but they basically ran through the same set of troubleshooting tips I mentioned above. They also pointed to the death grip issue and the manual network addition. They also mentioned that the Wi-Fi problem was a known issue with Galaxy Tab 2. As a result, I had no option but to request a refund.The only reason I gave a 2-star rating is because I didn't "hate" the product. For someone who is willing to ignore the Wi-Fi issue, this is a fantastic product. For me, I can't always be standing next to my wireless router. In my opinion, it kind of beats the whole purpose of having a tablet and a wireless router, especially when my iPad 2 can do a much better job at receiving signal and rendering web pages at more than acceptable speeds. And it is 2 years old!Disappointed.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Now, I know a lot of this is my own damn fault for thinking back to when it was newly advertised and not checking into what people's experiences have been so far; a lot of my problems also result from Amazon themselves, and from third parties. I just don't want people to make the mistake I did - I'm not whining about it, not asking for my money back, just letting people know what they are NOT going to be able to do with this device.First, the good parts is that it's a nice tablet and, with the price drop, a pretty nice deal. There are a lot of reviews covering the good points - I find the screen crisp and responsive (although I haven't yet put a protector on it); wifi speed is great - can stream netflix and looks pretty good. As a device to replace a lot of what I was using my phone for (besides "phone" things), this tablet is really quite nice - it's a pleasure web surfing and using email compared to a phone screen, and it's got decent processing speed and plays games quite nicely. Decent display for reading, although I personally still prefer e-ink for reading.But I'm disappointed in what I'm not able to do with it; the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 can do video output - this can't. I was hoping to hook it up to the TV in my exercise room to watch while working out, but no dice... not even SD.On top of that, I recently signed up for Amazon Prime... but you cannot stream video from Amazon to this device - it was part of the reason I signed up for prime. This is not a flaw of the device, but of Amazon - an artificial barrier, seeing as how you can play streaming content on "blessed" android devices.As a side note, in trying to bypass using an app for Amazon streaming by accessing it on the web, we find out that Adobe no longer makes a compatible flash player for the latest versions of Android. If you download a browser, like Dolphin or Firefox, that has built in flash, Amazon still claims the device is not compatible.Again - it's not flaws of the device, really, but it limits what you can do with it, and I just wanted to throw it out there that other Galaxy's - the Tab 2 10.1, the old 7.0, the 7.0 plus - all have features and abilities this tablet does not have. Yes, they cost more, but examine whether it's worth it for you before buying this one. As I write this, the Galaxy 2 10.1 is actually a really great price given the much larger size - and for some reason it can output video while this one can't (you'd think it'd be essentially the same exact thing except for screen size, but no).I don't know how this next one compares to other tablets - but on my phone I can move downloaded apps to the SD card. At 8MB, being one of the lower memory tablets available, I got mine along with a microSD card to save on device space, but it doesn't allow me to move apps to the SD card.So it's a decent tablet, but given some of the other great deals available right now you should think of other options. If you're willing to go even higher, I bought the wife and kids 7.0 pluses last year and they are pretty happy with them (still no Amazon instant video, though); they are far superior, but of course also far more costly. If you think video output or Amazon instant video might be interesting, I implore you to examine other tablets and do the research on them.As a larger device to do what I've been doing with my phone (except calling), it's definitely a decent product. I was just hoping to do more.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I and my husband both own these. We like them ALOT! He likes that it fits in his suit coat pocket, whereas an ipad would not. The speed is good, it is easy to use. I am really impressed with how long it holds a charge. i just plug it in every night and it's good for another 8 hour day of on and off use. We use 32 Gig SD cards so I don't figure memory would ever be a problem. I love the crown cases we purchased for them and how well they fit. (Note: it does not fit in suit pocket with the crown case on.)

tablet_galaxy_tab|The bad first: 1) Just bought it, and was very disappointed when I turned it on and the colors looked washed out, no matter what I did. I had heard so much about the presumably beautiful screen and I just don't see it. The colors are not dynamic at all, just drab, compared to the beautiful, vivid screen on my galaxy S2 phone. ( I am longingly viewing the two and comparing them as I write this. Where has all the vibrancy gone on the tablet screen...) Chatted with Samsung online, recommendation was to reset the tab, which I did but but it made no difference. Anyone have a remedy? 2)Lack of a micro hdmi slot for hd tv connection. Although I knew this was not a built in feature, I did not know that you cannot even get a decent HDMI adapter for it the way you can for other tablets. 3)Why no apps can be moved to the micro sd card is a mystery to me. Should be easy to fix? 4)I have not (yet)discovered a way to download videos etc. to the external sd card directy. When I download videos, pix, music etc. I have to download to the internal memory and then use cut and past via 'my files'. At least that's what I've been doing. So the internal memory fills up very fast and you have to keep moving things. Is there a way to download directly to external card?The good: 1)I love the 'allshareService' app, eliminates some of the hdmi connection peeve I have. I can play my media files on my sony tv at the touch of a button, full screen, beautifully done, but the tv has to be capable of receiving files. Don't know if this is a Samsung app or if it is part of the ICS package. 2) wifi and cpu works very fast, no glitches as others have mentioned. I had several downloads going at the same time last night as well as using the tab for other things and it worked like a charm, no hang ups etc. 3) Overall works very smoothly, and has a nice intuitive feel. Feels 'coordinated' in terms of all the different features, very easy to navigate. 4) Love that you can change fonts for your tablet. I used to have this feature on my old LG dlite phone and am delighted to see it on my new tab. 5) Online manual is well organized and covers the main questions well. Its easy to download to the tab. 6) Battery lasts longer than I anticipated, can't put an hour value on it but I used it heavily for hours yesterday without charging.So, overall, it is an excellent tab, but I really expected, and want, a more vibrant color scheme on my screen and there does not seem to be an option to adjust that.Edit: So disappointing: Three days after writing this review, the 'allshareService'application,which I loved because it allowed me to stream easily from tab to sony google tv to my galaxy S2 phone, was no longer to be found on my tablet. Called tech support four times, they said the issue was 'elevated to the next level' as it appeared the app had become deactivated and they had to find a way to reactivate it. They finally said the allshareService app had been discontinued (not aailable for download anywhere)and that only a new app, called 'allshare play' is now available. Well, guess what: allshare play is not compatible with my google tv and, even worse, my Samsung s2 phone does not recognize "allshare play" so I just lost the easiest and most important function I had for streaming of video, music ect. on this tab. It turns out "allshare play' is only compatible with two or three Samsung devices. Beware!! I just lost the main reason for liking this tab.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I am sure many before me has raving review on this tablet. So I won't go on about the usual stuff. I use the tablet mainly for reading books. I have 10s of thousands of books (electronic version, of course) and I don't have a good way to read them. Now I do. But since I bought this tablet in July, I found it acceptable for journaling as well. The typing does take some getting use to but I manage. It is definitely slower than with a keyboard. But I think all I need is some practice. A third way to use this tablet is remote desktoping to my work computer. It gives you instant access to everything I have at my desktop via WiFi at work. Get the "2X" app for remote desktopping.Finally, I use the PDAnet to connect this tablet to the internet via my phone. I have an HTC phone and don't have hotspot support (didn't pay for it). So I use the BlueTooth tether feature from PDAnet. Works great for reading news and web browsing.The camera leave something to desire, though. I didn't buy this tablet to take phenomenal photos but I would expect something slightly more decent than what this tablet can provide.No compliant about functionality. everything is intuitive. if you can figure this out, you should go back to chalk and slate. ;PIt took me two years before I caved in and bought this tablet. It was difficult to justify another electronic toy but there is no buyers remorse, none-what-so-ever. Buy it, buy it now and support Samsung in the fight against the evil Apple Empire! (Yes, I am an Apple hater)

tablet_galaxy_tab|I absolutely love this product. The expansion with the 32gb sd card is what sold me. The resolution is great and my children enjoy watching movies on long trips to Kona, about 2&1/2 hours. The freedom of not being tethered to a wifi connection and the ability to load my vast digital movie collection is great. This a great little tablet. I prefer it to any apple product. Apple is too proprietary to their OS, digital content, and expansion which has made them stand out from the rest will isolate them from market share when competitors product are offering options that they do not have. For the price there is no comparison. I originally purchased the kindle fire and quickly returned it for this product. Simply said, I love it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this tablet as a gift. Before giving it, I took the time to download and set-up the apps so that it was all ready for them to use. The only difficult part was having to set-up accounts with Samsung and Goggle for them without them knowing about the gift. Everything else about this tablet is very user friendly. The internet and downloads are very fast. The OS is a little different then Apple, but similar enough, that I was able to quickly navigate around the tablet. The camera takes good pictures, and the sound from the small stereo speakers is excellent. I am very seriously thinking of ditching my little notepad laptop (that I am using to write the review), and get a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 for myself.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Fantastic Tablet...love it's features! Let's me do a lot more reading where ever I have WiFi, or even if I don't. Easier on my eyes that my smart phone!NOTE TO ALL BUYERS! To use the Amazon Instant Video on their web site, you will need Adobe Flash for Android. I went to Adobe's help forums and found the following link:[...]It will tell you to what you need to know to get Flash installed on your Tablet. The Google Play Store has removed Adobe Flash from it's archives due to new video formats being developed. Why you would remove it before the replacement for it is in place, I'll never know.But you won't be disappointed in this purchase! I did a search on here and am buying the USB port adapter for this, so I can off load to a flash drive or use a full size keyboard on it. I also opted to get the 32 Gig card it suggested I get. You'll love it!! It even has the ability to control your TV, it's a Super Remote control too!I compared it to the Kindle Fire HD. This has Dual Cameras, and SD Card slot storage. I do not trust online backup services. Too easy for one-stop shopping for any hackers to get to your personal stuff.

tablet_galaxy_tab|**Edit: Without going back through the review, I must point out that after some discussion in the thread below it was exposed that while there may be several apps that allow themselves to be ported back and forth, this is not the norm and you should, for all intensive purposes accept this as a device that does not currently support moving apps to the SD card. Given this, if I have some time this week I'll root it and get back with whether or not that helps at all.This tablet has everything I wanted in a 7"'er, and I'm so impressed I'm thinking of replacing my ASUS ep121 with the 10.1 model for school and work usage. This tablet booted straight up out of the box, I inserted a preformated 64gig mSD card, which it took to without a single hitch, and proceeded to fill it with all my standard android apps (I've been using android since before it's retail release). The tablet's only irritating features, are that it does not support apps to SD, and when plugged into a 3.5mm jack it automatically turns itself down to near inaudible levels, when you turn it back up, it covers a chunk of the screen with some stupid warning about loud noise and ear damage... While I understand loud noise can certainly damage your hearing, I doubt if many people are in danger of doing this with their mid sized tablets.Vs. the Original FireI bought this with the first week of its release, and I preordered the fire, what I'm saying is, I have extensive experience with both... And because of that I don't understand the comparisons people are drawing. The Fire was never meant to be a full range experience, it's meant to be an ereader that handles color pictures. The fact amazon decided to add in web surfing or netflix support was them just testing the water. They didn't expect the tablet to sell like it did, and they didn't intend for people to use them the way they are.This on the other hand is a legitimate tablet, in a seven inch formfactor. You can read the specs, I'm not going to type them out again. But the web browsing is quick, I've only had one issue with firefox on it, and I simply reinstalled, not another issue since, using iSyncr I loaded it with all my playlists and top rated songs (wirelessly), the newest iteration of iSyncr even records your playcounts. The offline GPS function of google maps has not worked once on here, but tethered it works fine. I have synced with multiple bluetooth devices, and it handles swapping between them MUCH better than my Galaxy SII. The only real problem I have with it, is that samsung backed it up with complete trash for peripherals. Do not buy the samsung car stands or any of that stuff, there are plenty of bundles and alternatives by third parties (which I have reviewed) that work very, very well in comparison.Vs. the NexusI'm an ASUS fanboy, I love their components, but the omission of the mSD slot in the feature list for the GNexus is what made me grab this one and cancel my GNexus preorder. However, I recently spent the entire day with the two side by side, and I can tell you empirically that any differences are subjective interpretations. The screens are not so different that your eyes will melt, the speeds of function are not so different that you'll rue the day you paid for a samsung product, and when you start showing off all the content you have stored locally, the opposition gets sad... especially when you bring up how much youtube content is blocked to mobile browsing.In my opinion, the SGT7 is a clear victor here. I didn't walk away wish I'd bought a nexus, in fact I drove away with my SGT7 in the windshield clamp jamming to music off it and a giant smile on my face.The bottom line from my perspective is this:If you want a seven incher, that will handle all your basic media consumption and net needs, plus a few other things, this is it.It's also worth noting that Polaris office (which comes preinstalled) is the best MS office alternative offered for ANY tablet device.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Love this little tablet. I also own the 10 in. tablet. Has all the power of my 10 in tablet. This 7 in is small enough to tuck into my purse to carry along with me. Connected to my wireless internet as soon as I turned it on the first time. Smooth running. Plays games very well. Love the dropbox storage. Screen does show lots of prints but I have a cleaner puff to clean it. Love everything about it. This is a keeper. Would be an excelent first tablet for anyone.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Caveat 1: This is my first "Smart" device. My phone makes phone calls, that is all. Caveat 2: This is my first exposure to Android.When I discovered that Samsung was making a mid-sized pad with WiFi and GPS, for under $250, I was delighted. This seemed to be able to fulfill so many of my desires, including two big needs-- A mid sized pad for use with Skeye, an amazing and completely unique astronomy app, and a highly configurable GPS that was big enough to use in the car yet could still fit in the pocket of my hiking shorts. (Note that a WiFi IPad cannot do GPS or Skeye, and besides it is too big and expensive.)These two functions work great (for the most part--see below about screen) and alone make the device worth the price, but of course it does much more that is useful. I really liked that it could accommodate an external memory card to enhance the limited on-board memory, although this turned out to be mostly bogus, as apps cannot be put on the external SD card, due to terrible limitations in the Android operating system.For the first week it worked perfectly. By the second week the software was extensively corrupted. By the third week I had to "wipe" the memory and start over. This was very disturbing. But as far as I can tell, this is the weakness of Android, not a hardware issue. Fortunately, as "wiping" appears to be routinely required on Android devices, it is well supported and implemented. Many of the weaknesses of this device (corruptibility, many very buggy apps, poor memory management, crippled external SD card) are due to Android and it's wild-west ecosystem, not Samsung.But there are hardware issues too. The cameras are really poor, and no autofocus to boot. Makes many potentially useful applications useless. The main camera is said to be 3.2 mp, but has the resolution of a 1 mp camera at best. This is an area where Samsung really cut corners. My son has a fancy ASUS pad and the camera is 10x better, at least. The Sammy can't read barcodes, or work as a document scanner or as a text translator, because it doesn't focus that close. Sharpness is terrible at any distance. The main camera is not a real camera, think of it as a web-cam for Skyping (backwards) or spying on your babysitter, that is all it is useful for.The screen is good, but it lacks the brightness to easily use it as an in-car GPS in the daytime--too bad. The position of the face-facing camera is not the best, at least when used in landscape mode--it is designed to be used in the portrait position only. In terms of processor speed and internet download speed, it is about where you would think for $250--good, but not up there with the big boys. Internet download speed is 3/4 of my sons high priced ASUS pad (I got 15 mbps, the ASUS was 20 on the same wifi and network), overall speed is about 40% but raw processor speed is ~25%. For me, this is fast enough, but probably some people will think otherwise.Battery life is good but not great--when semi-frequently used as a GPS during the day, with the screen at maximum brightness, it barely lasted the day. For most uses battery capacity is adequate, however. Sound is not bad for such a device, better than I had expected, but it can't really produce sounds under about 400 hz (no big surprise). WiFi reception is good, but not quite as good as higher end products I have tested--certainly adequate most of the time. GPS works very well indeed, every bit as good as the higher end products I have benchmarked it against. It lacks a gyro, and therefore the functionality that a gyro provides (whatever that might be!).The wall charger that came with the Sammy appears to be a standard USB type, so I thought I could recharge the Sammy by plugging just the cord into the Belkin USB voltage charger I have in the car for use with my IPod, but it did not appear to work. I need to try again to verify this issue, but if this is a voltage mismatch issue, it is very inconvenient and a very odd decision by Samsung. Maybe the Belkin device doesn't produce enough current? Even with a strong magnifying glass, I cannot read the microscopic text describing the voltage/amperage output on the side of the Samsung charger!If a much better device comes out for under $350, I would consider upgrading to get a real camera and brighter screen and a real external SD card slot. Right now, no such product exists on the market in this size/price. On paper, there is no advantage with the Google Nexus 7, only downside. Maybe the hyped Apple Minipad, but I doubt it will meet my basic needs as described in the beginning of this review. So overall, I do like this device and will keep it (3 months return policy at COSTCO), but with a bit more refinement of hardware and software, this could be the Dream Device I have been anticipating for almost 20 years. It falls somewhat short of that at this stage, however.Update: The Samsung has been operating without any problems for a couple of more months now.

tablet_galaxy_tab|purchase at Costco (sorry amazon I saved $10) in a will-return-later mentality(Costco has a very good return policy). Now I am going everywhere with it. love the size that I can put in my purses. camera quality is not satisfying but I always carry a P&S cam so i don't care. I loaded my text book which I usually carry in a notebook computer. downloaded my ebooks. very handy when I need to record my expense right away. great size for handheld game device. I screen shot recipes for going to supermarkets.....ok I am not going to write an essay. The only one star deduction is for the advertised 8GB memory. I've got only 4.59GB don't see why. Other than that, I just love this device.Edit: This Tab 2 7.0 P3113 does not video output to TV (wasted my money buying the multimedia dock and HDMI cable). Samsung should clearified this on the product. What a disappointment. I have to change it from 4 stars to 3. Will pay extra attention to the capabilities or ask lots of questions of Samsung products from now on or won't buy it all. We'll know.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Tablet is working perfectly, haven't found any flaws yet. Also bought the 3 year warrenty to protect it. This was our second tablet after having a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 (the original) and wanting a second slightly smaller one. this fit the bill perfectly!

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Everything is good about it except when I would like to review my pictures and choose the slide show. The pictures are unfortunately run in the wrong order always starting from the last going to the first and there is no simple way of changing this apparently so I will have to search online for some software to do it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Got this as a gift for my son for making good grades at school; he is addicted to his Samsung Galaxy Tabhe hasn't put it down yet, he loves this Tab the apps are neverending, am considering getting one for myself!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|But I did. I use it just about every day for school and what not. No problems so far, although I hope those factory workers who put these together are treated well.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|the tablet can do so many things it is obsolete and i cant stop using it, every day i find another great way to utilize my galaxy II..
---

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I simply love it. It's big enough and heavy enough to take everywhere I need to. Great Apps. Nice screen resolution. I researched a lot and I am happy I went with this one.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Does everything it says. Great portability. Good price. I haven't had any problems with it that weren't of my own creation.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this to help me take orders with credit cards. I have had no problems and I'm making more money now that I don't have to tell people that I only take cash.
---

tablet_galaxy_tab|The.samsng galaxy tablet.2 is great and very much what I expected. I use it all the time and its great for my grandchildren to use. nice size screen and pretty lightweight. I love it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I would like to start by saying that I live in the caribbean and this is the second tablet that I have bought from Amazon ( the first being the original Kindle Fire). What I didn't know when I purchased the Kindle Fire was that the apps, e-books and amazon instant video are only available to customers in the U.S. (even though we are allowed to purchase books with the normal Kindle from our country, Trinidad). This is not case with the Galaxy Tab 2. You can download apps, watch Netflix(this comes pre-installed) and play games with other opponents online immediately after the registration process is complete. The volume button and the power button is well placed, even though the power button should have been a slide toggle switch rather than a push button toggle switch, to prevent it from accidentally activating (helpful when playing 8 ball pool), while you are turning the tablet for an alternate view. Its pretty loud even though I think there should be speakers on the sides when watching the tablet in landscape mode. There is a universal remote app which works fine( this also comes pre-installed on the tablet). The camera quality is a little poor , then again it is a 3.15 mp. The battery life is ok once not under heavy usage. I opted for 7&#34; cause it fits easily in big pocket clothing, like cargo pants and track pants. And you can't beat a price like $179.00 for an android based tablet. A good buy!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this tablet.This is the 4th tab I have bought and it is by far the best one yet. Does everything I need and more. Dont waste your time with anything else, best tab for the $
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Just got my tablet today and love it.I had baught a few cheaper off brand tablets before and was dealing with freezing or lock ups.So far this thing has none of those problems.Streams video great.The camera is not the greatest but isn't that bad either the screen side camera is ok too.Seems to have very good battery life.Great tablet for the money.

Thanks
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love my Tab S27! Using it to write this review. It is small enough to be portable, but large enough to be useful. It teathers well with my Galaxy Nexus, and fits between the small of my back and my belt. Like the Nexus it supports A2DP even though they say it doesn't, and works great with Nexus headphones so I bought a couple extra pair. It is also lower end jellybean so it will likely be supported for a while. I've had it since April and use it daily&#65307;for the most part it has replaced my laptop on the coffee table in the family room for browsing and short notes. It is also great for reading or study.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love it. Especially for the price I paid. It's no HD, but it looks fine. It's a little heavier than I thought.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|ITEM ARRIVE SUPER FAST 4 DAYS AHEAD OF DATE THE ITEM WORKS GREATTTTTTTTTTT THE PRICE WAS GREAT IF YOU CAN GET ONE DO SO
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love it...I have so much fun learning how to work it and it's very helpful in my life,I would recommend it everyone to have 1
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I dont regret one bit for buying this, I absoluting love this tablet, i use it more then I use my laptop now, I have pretty much given up my laptop. however, I do wish I had the 10-inch..
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|this device runs most of the apps that my smart phone can, but the apps it does run are the ones i run the most likedolphin browser, evernote and angry birds etcthe wifi on this is a/b/g/n but its only 2.4ghz would wish it had support for 5ghz but no big dealyoutube videos look really good on this in 360/480/720p.8 gb is small for storage space so i would definity buy a memory card for your videos, music and picturesoverall its a great tablet for watching youtube, reading a book in the kindle app etcbattery life for me ranges from 12-18hrs depending on what im doing so its pretty good there
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I use this daily. It's the best birthday present I've ever given myself. Once I figure out how to get adobe flash on it, it will be perfect.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is great does everything I wanted it to. Battery life is good. Screen is perfect small enough to fit in cargo pants pocket.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|So my girlfriend got the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 Two days ago, and she loves it. But we need help! Even though everything works fine on it we can not access internet to it at home. If we go out to a public place such as Mc'donalds, Wi-Fi works fine. We spent hours back and forth on the phone with Samsung and our cable provider (insight communications/time warner) last night. Its been very frustrating, it even tells us that its connected. We just need some type of help!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I would say that I am very pleased with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. It's perfect in size and great for traveling. It took me some time to figure somethings out. I even got frustrated when a minor error occurred.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|the tab is working fine is just that i can't seem to connect to the damn internet. Its saying that i am connected with a very strong signal but wen i try to roam the net nothing.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i wished i bought the bigger screen.another thing i don't like is that the tablet freezes on me sometimes.i mainly bought it because of the price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|email wouldn't load after 6pm and I did sync the time, and called support 3 times with no solution, maybe I just got a Lemmon
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I found decent software to install to use the tablet as a PDA, the google &#34;play&#34; store has an application called Pocket Informant. It is subscription based ($15/year, which is what you would pay to have an excellent paper planner). The developers are still working on it but you can submit feedback.7&#34; screen is big enough for my vision.Google play store seems to need higher end &#34;applications&#34;/programs, I'd be willing to pay more for programs that worked well.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I find the Samsung Galaxy so easy to use. The colors and screen are vivid and it is light enough in weight to handle easily.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Like smaller size, battery life, and ease of use. Fits easily into a purse or briefcase. Can be used for either work or play.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Resolution is high... Responsive to touch exactly like ipad.. But a bit complicated if you compare it to apple.. But easy to learn how it works !
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|best tablet ive ever had. Simple to use and very reliable. This would be great in the 10in also but 7in is easy to transport
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Tablet arrived on time and in a good condition. It performs perfectly as described. My wife wanted an Ipad, but I tried to convince her that Samsung Galaxy Tab is much better for her, and when she got it she was really happ, I really recommend this product and the seller too
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|been using for over 1 yr, and having no problem yet even though it sometimes was played by my 2 little boys (3 yrs and 6 yrs old)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|So far, no complaints at all!Great tablet for what you pay, nice design and screen responds quickly. Really nice audio from the integrated speakers, Wi-Fi works great (despite some reviewers said it does not pick up the signal properly).The camera has a decent resolution, not the best, but remember you are buying this item at less than 200 bucks.I bought this tablet for my little brother but I'm seriously thinking to get one myself now!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Im writing this review on my tab2, which we recieved the nextday after ordering. So far it workc great. The battery lastedover 8 hours, the screen quality is excellent; it's like an ipad mini. Flash works fine on it. I installed a Face Book chat anda yahoo messenger app on it yesterday and both work fine. Sound quality is excellent.The only con is the power saver on the screen is that it geos dark while in use, making somhe apps hard to use, even after I set it to stay on. This was easily fived after a friend found the hidden setting inAcessories, then found the setting to brighten the screen at the top.Otherwise, great product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Excellent Wi-Fi tablet in its class. stable and reliable device for personal user or business use. Samsung already distributed Jellybean and is upgradable and works fantastic.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Still learning the different aspects of the tablet but so far very pleased with the different things it allows me to do!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is great. Perfect size, not too small or too big.it upgraded itself after I got it. Would deff get again.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|saludos ya me fue entregado como lo ofrecido. exelente tab esta Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi) gracias y saludos
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It's a bigger version of my Android phone. Easy to use and fast! Every app is in the playstore. Easily connects to WiFi!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Using it for a month now. Still exploring, but so far, it still amazes me. Updated to Jelly Bean and it was even better.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Exceed my expectations. It's easy to manage and screen is enough to have a confortable view . I would recommend it .
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Greate tablet at a very low price. Greate price/value ratio.The OS look and feel is exactly like the Galaxy SIII.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really enjoy my tablet use it for keeping track of my personal schedule, also playing games. It is awesome.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|esta tableta es increible tiene todas las funcienes que se necesita, era para mi hija y quedo encantada, ya le baje aplicaciones y esta super contenta. gracias
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Christmas gift for my college grandson - he loves it - you don't see him without it!He's always using it - its so convenient he can use it lying down
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a wonderful tablet! It has all the features that I wanted, and you can download Google Chrome, so the internet is awesome!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|what can i say, its a android and when you get it it updates to jellybean system. which if you dont know, is AWESOME!! my only disappointment is that my amazon prime does not work on this device as far as the video streaming is concerned, but will be getting in touch with developers to find a solution. but over all its great, WAY WAY better then kindle or some other simple e-reader. thinking i like it better then my Ipad2. but you cant compare apples and oranges.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought it about a month ago and can not have enough if it. 7&#34; size makes it handy to carry around. Very responsive.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Everyone was sold out and back ordered, my daughter was very happy and I got it in 2 days.Very happy..
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|very good is excellent the tablet i recommend it versatile and has many applications works fine with wifimemory can be increased
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift.He likes it a lotNot as big as the iPad but easier to carry around
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I already had this one and I ordered this for my daughter, she loves it, can not put it down.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am still learning what all I can do with the tablet. The size is perfect and so far it does what I wanted it for. I really don't do much on the internet with it, but it has worked just fine when I've tried it. I definitely would recommend it to others.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Es una excelente Tabla, cumplio con mis expectativas! Es de mucha utilidad para mi y de facil uso. Se la recomiendo aquellos usuarios que esten interesados en adquirirla.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tab is so cool. I love the fact that it is android and google is a plus. There is not much I can't do with it. LOVE IT!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|We bought two of these one from another supplier, you had run out, and they worked marvelous on trip to Italy to keep in touch with US without having to lug laptop
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great little tablet! Especially for the price! You can't beat it. Very functional and user friendly. I bought two of them for my son's who are 8 and 10 and they absolutely love them. I am a huge fan of Samsung (I have the Galaxy note 2 phone and note 10.1 tablet myself). They are very fast and have great quality products. The functionality of it is great. It does everything a larger tablet can do. Plus you have access to the play store, which I love. I would highly recommend buying a memory card to go with it because 8gb does not take you very far. I got my kids a 16gb myself but it is expandable up to 32gb.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is perfect and worth $199. I was desperately wanting another tablet since my old one shattered and to be not so expensive. That's when I found this tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Not sure if I just got a bad unit or what, but 3 days after I had it the tablet would no longer take a charge or turn on. On the bright side the return process couldn't have been easier. Amazon sent me a prepaid shipping label (I printed it out) and a week later I had a full refund. Way to go Amazon!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|the price was very affordable for this high end tab, its works perfectly the sipping was fast and I've recommended it to anyone who wants to buy a tab.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Best tablet, and so cheap. Great price, just what I needed for work and school. Great choice over the nexus 7.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi) is a great little tablet. Not too big not to small. Works well as a full screen remote for Samsung UNES558000. Very user friendly so Im sure i will find other uses as i am a new tablet owner.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this product. Not only is it good for adults but also good for kids. My 9 year old loves this. He can play the same games that are on my andriod phone.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Me encanto, super buen producto, envio rapido, todo original, no me ha dado ningun tipo de problema, 100% recomendado. .
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great, portable device that I don't leave home without. No issues with the tablet or with shipping. Getting my husband one now.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great overall tablet for the business person on the go. Small and portable. The internet search bar is small and sometimes takes me a few tries to get the cursor in the right place. There are no arrow keys in the on screen keyboard so cursor placement is my only issue. Plenty of speed and just enough built in storage memory.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Buy this item for a gift for my girlfriend and was delighted truth very quick, practical and consistent in size, has an infinite number of applications 100%
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great size, has a long charge life, versatile and cheaper than a Ipad mini. Have had it for a month and no complaints currently
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I ordered the tab about two days ago and i LOVED it! and then all of a sudden it blacked out and would not come back on. It wasnt over heated, the battery was at 74%. smh
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|We've had this tablet for over a month now and it seems to be just what we needed. I even love how it has the capability to work as a remote for the TV. The only reason its not getting 5 stars, is because probably just like any other tablet - there has been a lag when playing games, but its not soo much that its annoying. It only happens once in a while. Very happy with this tablet!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i was interested in basic functions - email, calender, contacts and internet connectivity. Samsung Tab 2 services that purpose just great as well as other needs.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Nice product, received as seen. No defects, I'll buy another one to give as a gift to my pretty sister.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It's a great product. I would recommend this product to anyone. I however do not recommend if you're using for typing long drafts.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|pretty satisfied with the tablet... it's not as easy to read as an ipad mini but works fine for me at a much better price... had to get used to using a sensitive touchscreen and android....but that's just me not the tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Tablet is doing everything I attempted to do so far. The learning curve is a little steep using the manual I downloaded. I've had this tablet for only a week so it will take a little more time to fully understand all the features.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love my Samsung tab2 its great I also order the case and boothtooth key board. Which is very much like a mini Laptop
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|this samsung galaxy tab 2 works great ,screen l&#417;ks nice and light-weight. Some movies didnot work well. I recommend to my friend
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It was a gift so I really didn't do much with it. I have an Ipad so I'm spoiled but this was a great deal compared to other Christmastime vendors.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|and I couldn't afford an iPad so gave this one a try and its not bad. Was a little hard to learn to navigate but it does all I hoped it would do. Keeps up on Pintrest, Facebook and email and if I don't have my Kindle handy I can always read my books here. Doesn't stay charged as long as I would like but that seems to be a consistent problem across the board for all devices like this.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|producto de gran calidad y muy economico, lo que buscaba me gusto mucho llego e perfecto estado, seguire comprando excelente
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Amazing tablet, so glad I did my research and read reviews, buying my first tablet was a risky move for me as I have never had any experience with them, but this one is AMAZING!!!! Love that Netflix was already installed & having both the google play store & samsung apps makes tons of free apps at my leisure!!! If I ever buy another tablet it will be a samsung for sure!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I wished that it had better camera quality! Other than that I am well pleased and I use it daily!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It exceeded my expectations excellent'm happy with the purchase is fast and get all the files I need movies look great, I'm happy with the purchase.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for a Christmas gift for my husband. He has wanted a tablet. The IPad is so expensive! After doing a lot of research and reading consumer reports. I bought the Samsung Galaxy 2 for my husband. He LOVES it. It's in his hand every free moment.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Excelente tableta, es todo lo que necesitaba, muy util, rapida, versatil. Me permitio instalar aplicaciones y programas de genetica para mi trabajo. Amo a esta tableta, la recomiendo 100%.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love it. Too many applications to explore - early days yet. I bought it along with the Vulkano Lava box to allow me to have remote viewing of all my cable channels anywhere there is a Wifi connection. It works well. It froze a couple times when I tried to exit the Vulkano player app but it is great on start up and when streaming.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Easy to use. I love it! would recommend it even to a beginner that has not used a tablet before.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It's an excellent product, it does everything that a P C does, would highly recommend it, one small thing is that the adapter is not compatible with other products.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I chose this rating b'coz this tablet is very usefull fir me coz it has flash player. I realy recomend it to everyone.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Yes it's a smaller screen size but more portable in the process.No problem with any Android apps or games so far. Thinking about ordering another or maybe two.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The only downside is if you can install apps on the micro card, I havent figured out how to.I play on reddit, youtube, facebook, and all that, and it all runs flawlessly. Fantastic product. Its very responsive and a very reliable tablet. So glad I bought it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Should probably wait till I've had it a while, but its so easy to use! Couldnt have asked for anything better! Looking forward to learning it more in depth. Only had it a few hours and Ive already been able to do so much which is saying a lot because I'm not super tech savvy. Highly recommend this product!

tablet_galaxy_tab|Awesome stuff! i love it! Very fast and confortable for working and fun! Very good grafics, pictures, games and applications
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Latest Anbdroid - 4.0. As soon as I catch up with the technology, it will do pretty much anything I ask. Fast, light weight, great size and crisp, sharp visuals. Sound is amazingly clear for such a small device and provides enough volume. Battery life is good. only had it a week but, no complaints yet. (Oh! The only improvement I can think of is if it were 3G like Kindel and my phone )
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I LOVE my tablet! The only problem with it is our family wants to fight over who gets to use it! My favorite use is the Kindle app or Nook app! But the kids like all the games! A great purchase!

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is great tablet, if you like 7 Inch Android tablet this should be one of your first options. The dual core processor is fast, and the screen is great. And the upgrade to jelly bean make it more fluent.

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this for my grandaughter and she absolutely loves it. I now want one for myself. Easy to use.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Great Android tablet and the price was right. Just the right size at 7&#34;, great battery life. Just what I was looking for.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was about to go for the 10.1 inch ,but thought that a 7 inch would do. Using it everyday to watch netflix and go online. I also write memos to myself. I'm still finding so many new things to use it. Overall I like because its light weight and am able to access my books for recreation and school.good buy
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It's too bad that the various providers don't allow cross-device access to their apps, games, tools since many of those products have been designed to work on all of the platforms.... Android, Apple, Windows tablet, etc.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Tablet is is great for the price I wana say on battery alone it last about 6-7 hrs on auto brightness .. I use it to watch movies on Netflix and it work great hands down no problems yet an ive had it for a 1yr already great product .. on a not so great note I recommend a USB extender cable. Cause charger is kinda short :(
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Got this for my granddaughter for Christmas. Boy I was the best grandma in the world !! Well worth the money...
---

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|excelente vendedor y muy buen producto y 100% confiable y atento y el env&iacute;o excelente lo recomiendo 100 %.. hasta luego
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Simply the best tablet I've handled so far ... fast, reliable, stable, I have never been hung. It is an excellent tool for carrying your email accounts, review and edit your documents, etc. Finally the Galaxy Tab 2 tablet is superior to anything hitherto had handled. Perhaps because the only thing that would change would be for a 10 inch but not if it would sacrifice my galaxy tab 2 7 inches usefull. I can take the trouble to wherever and not hinder me at all. Maybe it's something that can not be said of the 10-inch ... Excellent!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I own the Samsung G3 and their 10 inch tablet and I love using them. Naturally I wanted their 7 inch tablet as well. I love the fact that I can open the box, charge it up and log into my Samsung account and most of my apps were ready for upload. I only had reload a few apps but otherwise it works flawlessly. I love the fact that I can add a micro SD card into the tablet very easily. I have no complaints on an of Samsung's products. They know what they are doing!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This product is Awesome and time flies away easily when i get started with tab each time. The Apps are absolutely amazing !!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This dual core tablet from Samsung rocks! Plenty of memory and good screen. Can't ask for more for the price! Nexus 7 is the only real branded competitor for this awesome product. I can't be happier!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Exactly what I was looking for. I am an extremely busy mom and this is perfect for me to be able to sit at the ball fields during practice with my boys and keep up on my reading for school. Not to mention the entertainment value. :-)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My daughter is happy with this gift, she use this tablet everyday. The size is good for use every applications.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|All the android apps are available. Plus nice size and great price!Bought during the Black Friday sale in 2012.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Learning more every day. All Apps work great and will try more. The speed is also great, screen clarity is also very pleasing.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Don't be fooled by other sub-300 dollar tablets. If you go the generic route, even if the product boasts a 1.5 ghz processor, you're likely to be disappointed with the performance. You will not be disappointed with the Galaxy Tab. It's what a 7" tablet should be. It's fast enough to be useful. It can multi-task well. It's small enough to fit inside a purse or larger jacket pocket. It has good battery life and an impressive screen. Get a drop protective cover for it, and you should have a functional tablet for at least 2 years.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This has been a great tablet. I watch videos on it daily. The sound and video are both crisp. You can download both the Amazon and Kindle apps from the Google Play store. I'm not a fan of some of the software that Samsung ships it with and the most recent software update isn't as good (IMO) as the way the software worked before, but it's still a great product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|the tablet Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi) are fine of price and cuality, you can buy this without problems
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i love this tablet it is a great product for the money lots of useful apps the interface is really great would recommend this to anyone
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My boyfriend is far from tech savy but he absolutely loved being able to take this anywhere and use it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love my Samsung Galaxy...........Purchased on a Friday before Xmas and was delivered by Monday Xmas Eve, how exciting is that to have for Xmas. Only problem is the SD card, nothing you down load goes on the card............what a bummer.Would recommend though
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was one of the early adopters of the Kindle Fire who got caught up in all the hype. It didn't take long for me to find many things I didn't like about it, but I won't mention them here. After giving it away, I decided to get the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. Believe me when I say that it was a major upgrade. Electronics are just one of many things that I'm very picky about.Having played with a few other Android tablets, I think that Samsung makes some of the best Android tablets. They also previously listened to their customers, and no longer mess with the stock OS.Pros:Depending on how you use it, the Galaxy Tab 2 has a very good battery life (TV shows/movies will drain the battery quickly).The screen is very bright and has excellent color.It's a great deal for the price (it's actually dropped in price since I bought it).Cons:Samsung forces you to have a few apps that I'm sure most people don't want (Next Issue, for instance), and you can't delete them.The included cable is too short. They don't even make a longer aftermarket cable, so I have to use a USB extension. I also think it's stupid that the Samsung cable is almost an exact copy of the Apple cable.Overall, this is a great tablet, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a quality Android tablet.Edit: It seems that a longer aftermarket cable is actually made for the Galaxy Tab 2. I should've searched again before reviewing.

tablet_galaxy_tab|We have 2 IPad 3's, and although we like them one big issue with Apple is no option to expand the memory with your own media. The Galaxy has a mini sd card slot which lets you transfer your own media to the device without having to pay for it. I have software that I use to convert dvd's to avi movies and to make MP3's from my cd collection, then I just move the files onto the mini sd card and I have it all on my Galaxy. Apple won't let you do this forcing you to repurchase any media you want.I love the Galazy so much the I purchased another for my wife. As for the I-Pads thery will go to E-Bay. Apple needs to wake up and stop ripping off the consumer!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|other than the update changing my home screen, this is a wonderful product. the touch screen is easy to use, the whole device is very smooth.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very nice product, my dad really likes the things that he could do with his new tablet, he really enjoy it!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Works well and was not too expensive. It was purchased as a gift and works as well as the i-pad. No instances of freezing and easy to use to access the internet. It has fun games. Worth the money.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great gadget for the price. I've had no problems using it with my home wi-fi. This is ny first tablet so I have no comparisons. It seems to have quick response. I have been fasicnated with tablets since they first came out, but,with a 3 computer home network, including 2 laptops, and also a smart phone, I jsut couldn't justify spending $600 plus on a tablet that I didn't really need, plus a monthly cell service for it. So, I settled on this $199 wi-fi only tablet. I was already setup with Samsung and Google through my Galaxy SII phone, so this tablet was easy to learn and setup. I find the display quality very good.I plan to use the 32gb micro sd I bought with the tab to store my music and pictures on. The reason I chose this over the Kindle Fire was because of the ability to expand the memory with the micro sd, the Android OS, and the built-in GPS. I have not used the GPS yet, so I will add to this review if I have something significant to add. Even with the kind of bulky case I got for it, I can put it in my big purse.I teach a computer class at our local Senior Center and I like to stay up on the latest gadgets available so I can help others with theirs. This would be a great beginner computer for somebody.With no trouble at all, using the Smart Remote app that came on the tab, I had it setup to control my TV, satellite receiver, stereo receiver, Roku, and 2 Blu-Ray players. Very cool. I love how I could re-install apps I had already installed on my phone on play,google.com to my new tablet. If the app says 'installed' click on it, then it will tell you if it is compatible with your new device, and you can install it to just the new device.I have not tried the camera yet, but I didn't buy this for the camera. It probably doesn't take as good a picture as my phone or digital camera, so I'm not worried about it. It would be good enoug to video chat on.The only thing I don't like about this tablet is the propritary plug in for charging. I will just have to carry this plug with the tablet I guess.I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't need to connect to the internet when not near a wi-fi, and wants a nice functional tablet at a very good price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Other than the fact that it's only compatible with a Samsung printer, I love it. Really disappointed that I can't print.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Above and beyond my expectations. This product make my life a littlle less complicated. Great way to keep schedules. Go Samsung....!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am still learning all the functions, but it has not been too complicated. It is the perfect size and a good compromise to my large laptop and cell phone.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|So glad I went with this tablet after having a bad experience with another one. It runs fast and the screen is easy to use and I've never had any lag.My boyfriend loves to use it to play games :)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|have had a chance to use this yet, but i'm sure i'll love it, it will keep me intertain on y trips.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Others have done a better job of giving information about this tablet than I can. The important thing for me was expandable memory. So this was the one. I use it all the time, and am very happy with it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Since I have my Samsung Galaxy Tab, I feel very well using an electronic gadget like this. As well as my kid using it.It's like a passion at home
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was a gift for my son who is away. He is very happy with this tab. It has many features and for the price is a great buy.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Had an Acer Iconia tab; liked it ok but it fritzed after about 14 months. The Acer Corp. wanted 2 C notes to reinstall O.S.The Samsung Tab seems a good value; will see how it holds up. It does everything the Acer did and is user friendly...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I Love this product , I had a kindle fire and was unhappy since there was a poor selecgion of language s and was slower, this Samsung is fast and has the fetures I needed
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I previously owned another 7&#34; Android tablet by Lenovo. That was ok, but it had some issues. This tablet is great. The screen quality is awesome, transitions smooth, and comes with great apps and features. I would recommend this tablet to anyone.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I like the Galaxy 2, still learning new things every day. I find the price was great, I am sure that I will get us to it soon.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my wife for her birthday and she has not been able to put it down.She loves the size because it can fit in her purse and all of the features are very easy to learn and use.Could not have made a better choice.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Got this little treasure as an early birthday present from my wife during Black Friday ($179) and have not been disappointed by it in my 3 months with it thus far. This is my first tablet, and my main usage of the tablet consists of light gaming, web-surfing, reading (e-mail and e-books), and the occasional movie trailer on Youtube. The display is good enough for its size; while the HD displays on the Kindle Fire HD and Nexus 7 are preferred, they are more of a novelty than a necessity for me. The option for the external storage is a big plus as well. It allows me to not bog down the already limited internal memory, which is about 5GB user accessible. Not to mention, the recent upgrade to Jelly Bean 4.1.1 gave a nice bump in overall performance. The sound quality is nothing to write home about, but it suffices. I usually get about 8-10 hours of usage out of this, with wi-fi usually turned off while I read.For what it offers, while not the best or ground-breaking, the Tab 2 delivers a good entry-level tablet experience.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My daughter wanted a tablet and was thinking about the Kindle fire, I started to compare them and decided to upgrade to the Kindle Fire HD but after looking at a few of them I decided that for the money the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 was the one for me.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Tab 2 is well made and has an impressive screen .Samsung has fitted the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 with a 1,024x600 Plane Line Switching
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this item as a gift for my wife,and she hasn't put it down yet. There is so much to do on this device.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I just have a month using it but what can I say. Is more then I was expecting. I really love this product, so sofisticated but easy to use. Downloaded many apps and the only one that doesnt worked is Whatsapp :-( But everything else is excellent.I recomend to buy a case with keyboard, sometimes is difficult to write using the virtual KB.Samsung USB ans HDMI cables are expensive, but you can buy a generic.In general terms I recomend this tablet very much.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i bought it as a refurbished one, and i found only one tiny flaw on display. It is just one spot. but it is not a big deal for using it.Without it, everything is perfect.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this for my husband as a Christmas present and he loves it. The screen is clear and tablet is easy to use. Memory is small but we bought a bigger memory card for it so it is not much a problem. Tablet runs smoothly and picture quality is great.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet does it all and being that it's not over-priced like the &#34;other&#34; brand just makes it that much better.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great product. I have difficulty getting App downloaded EG Golf Magazine via Next Issue.and there could be a shortcut to starting the process to get new Apps
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great device. my digital comics look great, books look great, and when my pc was down it was my only link to the web!! Best purchase of the yr.!!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|About the only complaint I have is the camera. Improve the quality of this, and I'd give a 5 star rating.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tablet. I am in love!! After about two weeks i got an update for my tablet and it changed the way I view apps on the tablet. Facebook is not as good since the update...otherwise I am very pleased with the tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am really enjoying my Samsung Galaxy 2, it cost less than the iPad and to me has more features. It is easy to use and lightweight, it's a convenience to carry around. Long story short, I'm impressed with my tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It works just like I thought it would. I just started student teaching and it has helped me keep track of what i have been doing everyday, along with being able to pull up something that is needed.I am still getting used to it so hopefully i will get better hang of it then i already have.If you want a tablet but not a huge one the 7 inch is the way to go because it will fit nicely into a decent sized purse and doesn't way as much
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The 7in screen is great and very easy to use. Got it for my 6yr son, he works it better than I do. So far all apps that we downloaded also work great. I still love my iPad, but for the price of the galaxy I think works just as great. Overall I think a great buy for who ever u buy it for.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love my tablet so much it goes everywhere. My mother is buying one because she loves mine too. We are a family of Samsung tablets.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My daughter likes this very much except for one thing and that is the camera. She likes a camera that takes clear, clean pics to share with her friends. The camera on this tablet is just fare and a bit grainy in her opinion.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I brought this tablet for my fiance' and he loves it. He is on it all day and half the night and as a computer specialist he has explored every program and apps. I would recommend this tablet to any one who can't afford an iPad or more expensive Samsung Galaxy. It is worth the price and you can do just about anything you wish on it from reading books to watching movies. It can also control your TV. Nice little tablet and fun to use.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Excellent product, better than expected, the image is so clear, so easy to use and the size is perfect for me, big enough for watching videos and movies, small enough to fit into my purse; I mainly use it for web navigating, music listening and to read, I've already downloaded lots of games and apps very easily. As usual for Amazon, the item arrived on time and in perfect conditions. Highly recommended.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this tablet. Even though I'm still learning things that it will do I am impressed with the quality of the tablet. This is my first tablet so I have nothing to compare it with. I like the availability of the SD card slot for more storage memory.
---

tablet_galaxy_tab|I've had enough time to test it. And I can say that this is a really good product regarding g price and performance. I've bought it as a gift for my sister and she just loves it! It's good, small, big enough and it's price is perfect!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Does everything! Still working on familiarity, but so far it's great! Clear screen, clear video. Good audio. Good web browsing, Facebook app is similar to pc. Responsive.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|THIS TABLET IS THE BEST I HAVE USED SO FAR AND IT IS SMALL ENOUGH TO TAKE ANYWHERE. I AM AMAZED AT THE SPEED OF IT AND ALL ITS CAPABILITIES. THIS IS A GREAT BUY FOR 199.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this tablet from Amazon directly for a very nice price. I felt that the value of performance to price was adequate for this product. It is finicky and sometimes very difficult to type on. The software is touchy and can be slow or difficult to use. I have found this best for watching movies on Netflix but other applications are touchy. While I am not unhappy with this product I belive better ergonomics would improve its user-friendliness.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great product, it does everything I need and more. The tv controls are an added bonus. They make it really easy to find the programs you want to see. This is an excellent buy, with no complaints.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love it. My husband got it for me for our anniversary. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I can not play my games on facebook. It is real easy to set up for email. I love the color. And my husband was concerned about it being only 7 inches but you can make it bigger. Not the screen but the pictures. Awesome.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Stays charged for a really long time, excellent picture, does just about everything a computer can do, the kindle app on it is great, reading books on it is wonderful
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my daughter for her birthday, she loves it and I like the fact that you can have additional storage with a mini SD card. She has been able to download so many free books and loves to listen to music. We are still trying out all that she can do with it, but so far its worked great!!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|A great product. I purchased one for the family, its wireless capabilities make it a favorite around the house without having to lug around the laptop.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I just received my galaxy tab 2 today, and it is everything I thought it would be ( Had the old galaxy tab which my grandson have and is still running strong). I thought I would have to upgrade to the android jelly bean from the ice cream sandwich, but was surprised to see that it is already on the tablet. So that is what I wanted to let reader know that the tablet come with jellybean 4.1.1 instead of 4.0 ice cream sandwich. Inserted a 32gb sd card and ready to go. Love it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have an iPad as well but it has it's limitations since Apple will not speak to Adobe Flash Drive (snobs). Very compact and easy to use.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this tablet for my kids for Christmas so that they would stop using my iPad. I figured it would be an less expensive alternative but still a brand name that I could trust. I've been pleasantly surprised by the system - it works great and I really love it. We use Android phones so the interface was very familiar to us - it was just like using a bigger version of our phones. I really prefer this system to the iPad for a lot of things. Because of the smaller form factor it's easily slipped into my purse (not so much with the iPad). This comes in handy as I like to make my grocery lists on the notes page. The iPad is a bit cumbersome for this purpose. Overall, I love it, it works great, it's exceeded my expectations and I'm happy with the purchase.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great first tablet for someone just starting out in the tablet worl. Bought for my daughter and she really loves it. My greatest compliment goes to Amazon for their customer service. First tablet got stolen off my porch. Called Amazon and with no questions asked, sent me a new one over night. Cudos Amazon!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I tried several tablets before I settled on this one. Samsung makes a good tablet, it is in the medium price range and easy to use.As a 78 year old grannie, I was not sure but over the holidays I found out how good it is for photo's and video.

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this for my son for Christmas. He broke the iPad I bought him two years ago and it couldn't be fixed. This tablet was$189 and he is thrilled with it. Great deal. The only advantage I can see with an iPad is iTunes.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I like the fact this product is simplicity and sophisticated at the same time. Easy to pull up multiple screens for quick access. I have been using Samsung products for 3 years now and I must say the still have not fail to impress me.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It's been everything we hoped it would be! We looked at ipads and weighed the cost over the options available and felt the Samsung was the best fit for us! We're so glad we bought it~
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I don't like that it has no flash drive period. Samsung should at least provide one of their own, since we can't download Adobe. Make sure before you buy that it has everything you need.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Works good and very pretty colors. I am getting rid of my computer just to use this. I love that you can add an sd card for more memory.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I tried the kindle fire hd and completely hated it went to my local walmart and bought this amazing thing. I use it at school during my breaks and at home to just browse as well. For the price you cant beat it , if your looking for a small portable tablet this is it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung Galaxy Tab is very stylish. It is easy to carry. You can store a lot of things in here. You can surf through the web. You can download apps. You can play games. It is light and small for you to carry.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I like it. It has some quirks in performance now and then but overall I'm pleased with my purchase. I like and own Apple Products but this is a heck of a lot cheaper than Ipod mini and has alot of cool features. Good Value.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|For under $200 you can not go wrong with the Galaxy Tab 2 7. On a price to value basis, this product is an absolute win if you are looking for a powerful but inexpensive 7in WiFi tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Purchased 2 for kids. They are very nice tablets but does not run flash so some websites will not work.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The item was very good, I love it. It has fulfilled my need as a device. To me it work better that the ipad .
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very fast and easy to use. Long battery life. Really awesome for the price. HIghly recommend. Could use rebtel or skype or others and use it as a phone if you're away from home and wanna use it as a phone more than probably have to use a cell phone wireless plan.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Purchased for our 5 year old (just turned 6) for Christmas and she loves it. Heck, I'm thinking of getting one this size for me :). Had no problems with getting it by Christmas Eve. Have no complaints!

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Es un tablet muy practico, no es muy grande y lo sificientemente peque&ntilde;o para trabajar comodamente. es muy util para llevarlo en los viajes. es rapido.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Despite having a laptop, and a smart phone, I'm addicted to this little Samsung tablet, it does it all! not heavy, u can take it everywhere especially if you travel a lot like me. I can watch Netflix, videos, check my emails, browse, etc. The price was the best $178.00!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|No pressure sensitivity but otherwise a fantastic purchase. I wanted something to carry on the go for my art and work and it does the job. Pressure sensitivity its what I really needed but I remedied it by buying a tablet art pen
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|We have one of these and one nexus 7&#34; and both are fantasic. great deal at $199. We also bought a cheap 7&#34; tablet that has been a giant pain.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am very happy with this tablet. Great purchase. It responds quickly when using my wi-fi. Perfect size; no need to spend upwards of $600+.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love everything about this tablet! It's the perfect size for me and is easy to keep on me at all times. My only complaint is that the rear camera stops working when I try to take outdoor pictures. Other than that it's great!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My wife has wanted one of these for a while, and for the price, this is the best one on the market. She uses it for keeping track of things and for internet access when we travel.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|is fast, good performance.only one thing, don't conect to my cel phone when I want to share my cel phone conection
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It was for my grandsons 9 & 11. I could not find this item anywhere. It was backordered, I was so blessed when you finally got them in, so they could have them for Christmas. They have loved them, and haven't laid them down since. We rate them very highly!! Thank you again Amazon.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my mom. I knew nothing about android devices, yet I was able to get it all set up for her without reading the manual. It's very user friendly and easy to use.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this tablet I use it a lot the battery lasts a long time and its great for games and notes I have no issues with it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is our first tablet and we've also purchased the 32Gb micro SD card for the expansion. This is a beautiful system, functions quickly and has plenty of apps to play with. It has way too much to do with Google for my liking but most of the trash and useless programs can be deleted... then replaced with better ones. :)It took a bit for me to get this connected to our wifi but customer service (using online chat) is super fast and knowledgeable. I'm going to recommend this rascal to everyone I know who's looking for a tab and will also probably pick up a second one... since the wife likes this one so much.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is everything I was hoping it would be. It has fantastic battery life, it is very quick easy to use and the android apps available are fantastic. I definetely recommend it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|it weight good to menot heavy!and it is good size! to bring every where kkkif you have a plan to buy tablet! it is
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this some days ago, still discovering what kind of things can be do with it, amazing screen! . .
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this tablet for Christmas and love it. It's very easy to use, it comes with the power cord to charge it. The charge lasts for several hours. The android system is very easy to use. The screen is very crystal clear, the pictures that it takes come out very nice. The only downside to the camera is that it doesn't have a flash, so the lighting needs to be fairly bright otherwise the pictures turn out a bit dark and grainy. Watching videos, surfing the internet and using apps are much more convenient than waiting for my desktop or laptop to load. One of the coolest things I think is that I can use my tablet to control my tv, surround sound and blu-ray player!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|v e r y g o o d t h i s i t e m.a n d i l o v e it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a perfect device especially for new android users. It has a lot of Samsung Apps and functions in addition to Google ones. Battery holds long. Screen looks wonderful.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.. EVERYTHING ALLRIGHT BUT I PREFER THE ASUS NEXUS :) JEJE... BUT THIS WORK GREAT
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. He loves it and barely puts it down. It seems every day he finds another function that he likes. He highly recommends it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The tablet I ordered came sooner than the estimated shipping date and in great condition. My son has been using it for a few days and it works as advertised. I would certainly recommend both the product (Samsung Galaxy Tablet II 7 inch) and the seller.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I could'nt ask for a better working tool,and got it from you for a far better price than I' ve seen else where
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great tablet. We r still setting it up but it is easy. I would highly recommend this tablet. It very user friendly.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|love the galaxy tablet 2 does everything the I want to do and more handy fro travel and come on quickly
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i use this mainly for plane rides, but will start using more apps as they mature.you can play games, listen to music, watch movies, read books and papers, all with ease.the only thing i don't like is that when watching a video (when you load up movies from your computer which you've ripped, they come over as videos), at the bottom of the screen, the word chapter appears along with the chapter #. i don't know how to get rid of that and it doesn't show when i view the movie with devices.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Good Price, nice functioning, but Android is still with some bugs, as well, excellent product for Price and Using. Google Play is fantastic!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great..perfect size, so many features its amazing....ipad what? Beats it anytime, find a friend who has one and ask, or go try it out at a store.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought a total of 4 of these this Christmas.. All have worked great so far.. Easy to find apps , battery life is about 3-4 hours,kids love them.. 4 year old primarily uses mine....
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my boyfriend, I currently own the nexus 7. I was comparing the two, I really like the Samsung as well, it has back and front cameras, and you can expand the memory with the SD card slot. The Samsung tablet is very, very cool. Had the most popular apps, like netflix and youtube, already installed.The only thing I thought my tablet had over the samsung was the camera quality (the front camera quality in particular, the back camera seems to be OK) My tablet has no back camera though, so the Samsung beat it back there anyway.He only just opened it, and lol he thinks I want to use it more than him! It's a great tablet so far, and I know it will provide much enjoyment for him :-) (besides me, ha ha!)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING A TABLET. I AM SURE GLAD I DID BECAUSE I LOVE THIS PRODUCT...I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really enjoyed using this tablet, its battery can handle a full day of heavy web surfing without charging. No problems with speed or performance. The camera is decent for the price. The back Is made of a scratch resistant material. It loads web pages very quick with out lag, colors are crisp, and movies are HD. Really good tablet for the price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this as refurbished. Saved money works like a brand knee one.Looks awesome as well. If you are looking to buy one. Stop here this one is fast. Has a lot of extras.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my son as a Christmas present and he hasn't put it down since. He uses it for everything from school work to looking up stuff up for his games.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm a total Apple fanboi but when this went on sale at a local store making it under $190 I decided to take a chance on buying one. I've been using it for a few days now and still have not regretted the purchase.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Is being used to assist with daughter's school work. a bit small for parents, but our daughter loves it and has been using it the day it came to the house

The stability of operative system that is really great and important, the procesor speed is much better than first edition. And finally is ANDROID os everybody knows what's means you can do werever you want with your divece. Highly recomended (Samsung Galaxy Tab 2)

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love it. Got it for my girlfriend and we both love it. Just like our Samsung Galaxy 3. I think we will be getting all our appliances Samsung also. Just got washer and dryer and microwave. Smart appliances
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This little tablet does it all and does it very well! If you have an Xbox 360, the AllShare feature will work through the console via wifi and allow you to watch videos and look at photos on your television. I am always discovering new and cool things that this tablet will do! Move over Apple. You have a lot better and cheaper competitor! I highly recommend this product. My daughter has the 10.1 bigger version of the tablet and she likes it better than the iPad!!! By the way, I just received, over the air, the new version of Android, Jellybean 4.1.1. So, when you receive your tablet, check for updates and upgrade your system.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Amazing tablet & perfect for my son! I love the parental lock app that I can choose what apps & programs he has access to.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had this tablet for about a week and love it. The screen is very responsive. I was only going to give this 4 stars because I had some major wifi issues when I sat on the couch with it. But it was updated today and that issue is completely fixed now. It has has a very good voice searcher thats fun to search the app store with among other things. There is one big disapointment with this device where you cannot move apps to SD card. But that is a android problem not a samsung problem. I have used the peel app to turn on and off my big 20 year old big box TV and it worked well. Some people have complained about the issue with only having half the memory they clain it has but it has not been a problem for me. It also has Adobe flash player which can be install on the Adobe archives web page. It works well. If you have any question please feel free to post them and I will try to answer them quickly. Sorry if this review is bad it's one of my first.Update:I have had this device for several months now. It get over 8 hours of battery with wifi on but screen brightness on really low. I now check out books from the library on it and can even access my Barns and Noble NOOK account. I had some more trouble with the wifi but found out it was just the default internet app. Got mozzarella Firefox and got everthing worked smoothly. I now take science notes with the notes application it came with then I back them up to Google drive. Its a really cool feature. If you get the cable to plug in USBs it works with anything that does not have a battery.I still have no regrets but will keep updating my review when I find new things it can do.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have never had a tablet but I love this I would recommend this tablet to anyone. I can surf the web and play words with friends.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Really good for reading but for anything else its a 3.7/5 the internet loads kinda slow for a tablet but faster then an OLD computer same kind of speed you can say for a windows vista.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very happy with my tablet! It was very easy to set up and use. Size is perfect for my use.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|liked all about it its price its deliverary and the direction that came with it i am looking forward to do a lot more with it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Nice tablet. I researched these tablets online before buying one for my husband for Xmas. This one was at the top of my list, so when I got this one for my Mom for her birthday, after using my husband's at home, it was a no-brainer. Very nice, quick responding tablet. No glitches so far. I still use my laptop, but now I also use my husband's tablet. If you sync it with your existing google account, you can get your emails, notifications (fb, twitter, etc) on it and clear them out instead of your phone and both will sync so you don't have to do it twice. Pretty sure you can do that with any android device. It's just nice to be able to do that. Enjoy. I would buy another Samsung android anytime.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I wanted a tab that I can carry in my purse/messenger bag. Most of the things I use are android products kindle, nook, hulu, HBOGO, my Google account, netflex, internet explore. My only issue is it doesn't have a a lot of storage space if you down load aot of apps you can easily use up majority of your memory. I purchased a 32 gb micro SD card so it should help. Next time I will diffidently get one with more memory. Other than that I honestly love it. The screen resolution is fantastic I have watched a few of my tv shows on it.Oh and the speakers..Samsung gets a bravo for the speak quality. The sound blew me away for a tiny unit it packs a punch (there are two speaker slots on the bottom portion of the devise. I would have never thought the sounds could be so crisp and clear and loud considering how small the speakers are. I just loved that bonus!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this at heb and I love it. Slim,light and fast, but the camera lags and the quality isnt great. Other than that its a great tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Lot better than the 10.1 in. I hope this can help.Very handy, small and practical. Really, the best .
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Cheaper than some other big name products and has endless apps. Without paying a zillion dollars and worrying about what kids will do to things, this is a great option. Good size--not too big, not too small.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|A lovely tool that helps me to get everything done. All my work and all my play and I'm not done discovering it yet. My only challenge is how to resist having it in my hand all of the time. GoodStuff Samsung!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this after &#34;test driving&#34; my daughters. Very happy with the product. It's size, battery life, functionality and yes, cost (half the cost of an iPad mini) all make it a great little companion for travel when I don't need a full laptop. Even came up with an unexpected use, used the camera to record fabric samples so my wife could match the colors/styles at the fabric store for her quilting project.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|the tab itself is just fine. i bought it as a gift for a friend. it works perfectly, and she loves it. however, when refurbishing, someone must have forgotten to fully wipe the memory, so it came with bootleg versions of a couple new movies. i was super embarrassed when she showed me, but then we just laughed about it. Still five stars, but refurbisher, please remember to wipe the whole memory before selling.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great tablet, ready to use out of the box, no issues using it for few days now, battery life is great its everything you need from a travel tablet. Highly recomended !
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|excelente tablet! muchas funciones, alta definicion, buen sonido dos cornetas, rapida, buena conectividad del bluetooth y del wiifi, muy buena compra..nada que envidiarle al ipad, mejor que la kindle fire.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I had buy an other table, sorry but a chinese table, but in 2 weeks dont work, i buy thos table to my wife and i had to buy one for me. I like it, Im surprise by the quick movements of the graphics and the programs runs very fast.
---

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The tablet is very nice, works well and is constructed well. The screen is clear, their are multiple camera lenses, and access to the Internet is easy.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 -- I got my girlfriend one as a gift, and I immediately wanted one for myself. They're good quality refurbs, and there's so much you can do with them such as directly link them and share videos and pictures. I highly recommend this item to anyone considering buying brand new and wanting to save a few bucks.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my girlfriend so she can read books and play games. She like to read the news on her phone which is rather small so this was a nice upgrade for her and it fits her hands perfectly.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really like this Tab. Very easy to use and fun. Still finding out about all the features and what it will do, but so far I really like it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Perfect for my use... no issuesI have recommended this product to my friends and familyit works great for me
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My sister is ecstatic over this product and does not go a day without using it. She simply loves this product
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tablet, so I'm still figuring things out and really cannot compare it to other tablets, but I like it very much so far. I do think it would be nice if it came with a stylus for precision as it's very touch sensitive. A user manual to speed up the learning process -it's very different from my windows laptop- would be nice too.I could probably give it a fairer review in 6months or so!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I fell in love the moment I received it :-). So far so good... One complain for a battery life, if it is in safe energy mode, it lats longer. If needs to be brighter, dies in hours :-(. Overall - slim, sophisticated, expensive look. Enjoy it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I use it when I travel, to check my emails, weather, and find my way by Google maps. Its light weight and compact size makes me easy to carry it. That's my purpose to buy this product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great tool for kids on school, for me it was better than nexus 7 because the tow cameras and the infrared option

I have seen many for alot more but cant beat the price for this type of tablet. now we dont have to use our phones for stuff. I would for sure tell people to get one for this price..
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was a fantastic purchase! Why spend much more on an I-pad when this does everything you need for a lot less? My son loves the facial recognition as a password alternative. Great little tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I ordered this for Christmas and I love it. I can upload files from my computer into my dropbox and access the files on my tablet. I can edit files created in Microsoft Office and I can view my school webpage without the need for a computer. This does exactly what I ordered it for and more. I have installed checkers, chess, and several other games and I've installed a program that allows me to watch streaming TV on my tablet.I would recommend this tablet to anyone that is looking for a great tablet at a great prce.
---

tablet_galaxy_tab|Buy the tablet as a gift for my wife and used to work, is a stylist, and easily find what you need to show your clients, highly recommend this tablet for those who like surfing the internet and playing.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I use an iPad at work. I did not find the Galaxy tablet to be anywhere near as easy to work with as the iPad. That said, my 6 year old boy is using it without any trouble.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this item so much that I bought one for my husband. It carries easy in my purse, it has a few accessories that are awesome from charging it in your car lighter to key board and others. Love the wifi, I don't need another plan costing me more. like idea that some of the apps on my phone and other tablet just transferred over. Can't say enough love it. Arrived in plenty of time.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very good product and did meet the expectations. Product in good shape as the picture and description of vendor.Thanks.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|this tablet is great, worth every cent i paid for it, its not a mega tablet as other but does the work very good
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is amazing. The screen is just the right size. It's light and slim and the screen resolution is so bright and clear. I instantly stream movies, music and occasionally read books on here. I use this to check emails from work. There's a GPS, internet access, plus a whole bunch of apps you can purchase or download. It took a bit of convincing by my friend to get a tablet but I feel like it makes life so much easier and I love to stay connected. This is the perfect device for doing so. I even compared some reviews of this tablet and the ipad and several sites ranked this samsung tablet higher than its' Apple competitor. The price is more affordable than the iPad too.

tablet_galaxy_tab|For my use and needs, a great price at half the ipad price. Was promptly shipped and received on time.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love my samsung galaxy tablet! :) The only thing I dont like about it is, that it only has two speakers on one end. I dont understand this, it should have two speakers on each end. That would B AWSOME! :) But other than that, I Love It!! :)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, it easy to use and understand, great quality, everything I wanted! I think it is absolutely awesome!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this for my 11 year old son. I must say, I'm impressed. Not only does he love it. I do too. Now, I'm thinking of getting myself a tablet. Thank Amazon for selling it at a reduced priced. Although Amazon was out of stock when I placed my order, it was still delivered in time for Christmas. **Amazon, you rock**
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I would highly recommend this product! I'm not exactly the most tech-savy person in the world. My brother says there are a head of the game consumers, middle of the pack consumers, and the late bloomers. He compares me to the late bloomers in technology. So I don't own anything that deals with technology newer than 2008. I've used other people's tablets, and smartphones so I knew the jist of how they work. When I got this tablet for Christmas it was super easty to use and navigate. Within the first day I was running it like a pro. Its fast and very touch sensative. The battery is good. It usually lasts me anywhere from 6-8 hours depending on what i'm doing. The screen is clear and movies work well on it. The ONLY down fall so far is the camera. It doesn't take very clear pictures, but I knew that when I was buying it. I didn't buy it for the camera. My wife is jealous and wants one too know.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It will do all that you want a Pad to do, and you will save Big $$$$$'s over an I pad!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Excellent display. Seems to do everything my Ipad can do. Google games work and download well on this tablet. Would recommend.

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have the Sumsung Galaxy Nexus and i am really happy with it, specially that the operating system is Android Ice Cream Sandwiches. Therefore i have decided to buy the Tab 2 which is having bigger screen and i really feel comfortable reading my emails.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It is so easy to Navigate, From social media surfing the net watching movies playing games. The battery life is great. I just love it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was looking for the best tablet for my money, and this is definitely it!, way better than the apple one with almost the same apps for free and like 1/3 of the price, black friday offer made it even better!! I will never change to another brand!!! super easy to use battery lasts long enough for all my needs. really loving it!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have only sctatched the surface of the things it is capable of and am still feeling my way through it. The potential is amazing. I am not a techie, but the pad is very useful and it's features can be discovered intuitively. From reading reviews, both technical and individual, it's not cutting edge anymore, but is solidly built, stable and well priced. It more than meets my needs and expectations.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is an excellent tablet. Good size, fastest as I expected and Android a good OS. The unique compliance with Samsung is that the tablet does not has internet access by it self, only by WiFi . I don't know if it is a way to connect it itself using an USB adapter and a USB internet modem or something... if someone knows how and share the knowledge will be good.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It's a great product, im happy with it's good quality and excellent condition i recomended it good choicethanks a lot
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i like it much better than my kindle Fire.... and i loved my kindle fire.... the mini sd card is great... the ease of switching between applications is awesome... and on top of that... it is a universal remote control!!! totally awesome!!!! the only down side is that now my sister wants to replace her kindle fire with one....
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Tablet came to me quickly and the speed of operation is excellent as well as the available applications. It ties in nicely with my wi-fi.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It's a great investment! Find a nice solid case and you'll have a great mobile device ready for any travel
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|For the price, this tablet does what I needed: browsing, taking pictures, reading, simple apps, etc. Wi-fi is fast. It crashed once while using a low-light setting camera, but otherwise has been great.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I ordered this Tab refurbished because I really like the white version and they no longer sell the white version brand new.I ordered the Tab on Monday and it arrived on Friday ,came neatly packaged ,the item was without scratch or dent and works perfect.The only problem I have with this tab is the available memory.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was my mother's christmas present and was totally perfect!!!! It arrived on time, super quick (more than spected) and on perfect shape!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had tablet for a week and really am enjoying it. Fast browser. Love that you can get Books from both kindle and Barnes and Noble, plus other places.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|For less than $200, great function and looking. The MicroSD card slot really is a big add from my original Galaxy Tab 10.1. Now I can put camera cards directly into the tablet.Amazon Prime shipping is quick and makes the purchase process great
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have a Google Nexus 7, but my sister in-law was dying to get this Samsung tablet. I'd say it's comparable in quality to my own and she won't go anywhere without it. :)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is snappy! I love it! Would recommend for anyone to buy. Nice features, bells and whistles and long battery life.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I LOVED THIS TABLET ITS AMAZING I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD BUY IT IT IS VERY XHEAP AND WORTH THE MONEY
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|good, easy to use, clear pictures.MAKE SURE DO NOT BUY IT FROM ELECTRONIC EXPRESS, THE CUSTOMER SERVICES IS NOT GOOD
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Gave these to grandkids for Christmas, and they absolutely love'm. Their parents do, too (ha ha)! I have a Nexus 7 and a Kindle Fire HD. I think the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 compares well with both of those, at a slightly lower price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this for my granddaughter to replace her Ipod. She loves it and it's so user friendly. She doesn't want to put it down. Her dad bought one after he saw hers and I'm thinking of getting one too. I already have the Samsung Tab 10.1 and it's great, but love the handy size of the 7".
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is a perfect sized tablet for work. Its Light, fits in my medium sized purse and it works well with my work PUSH emails!PROS: Responsive, Long Battery like, Good productive appsCONS: Wish I could find one with an UnLocked phone component!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I received my tablet faster than expected. This tablet has so many functions and more. Its easy to use and the exact size to fit in a cargo pocket. It's only $250.00, well worth the price. I defintly recommend this tablet to anyone who travels.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i love this tablet i brought this just for the purpose of watching movies and tv show when am on the go its compact and easy to use i recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet samsung is where its at .
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is a great buy for the money. I haven't had any problems whatsoever with it, and look forward to using it for work. The interface is great, and really easy to use. I also bought a small pouch case Black Neo-Cushion Tablet Sleeve Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 ( 7-inch , Wi-Fi ) and Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus + Android Tablets the Ringbo Screen Protector [Ultimate Clear] Ringbo Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 New Release Tablet 7" Screen Protector Cover Film with Warranty and the dock as well Samsung EDD-D100BEGXAR Universal Desk Dock for Samsung Tablets.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|We received the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and my son has hardly even set it down. He loves it and it is very user friendly.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tablet. How awesome! This tablet is of a very high quality. It took me a couple of days to figure out how to use it. I guess downloading the users manual with a little reading would have helped, but who does that anyway. The information I am getting from it is really great. It's ease of use is quite good after a little practice and getting used to. I would highly recommend this tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Got my tablet for Fathers Day and havent looked back. I thought it would be a little small at first but i have grown to love the smaller profile. i love to sit and watch tv or browse the web. coupled with Beats by Dre and I find myself in another world all the time.My 8year old loves to watch her videos on it and also to play games. its compact enough that it fits into my back pack for easy travel.overall Great alternative to the Ipad.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this tablet. I had another tablet previous to this one and I barely used it but once I got my Galazy Tab 2 7.0, I haven't been able to put it down. I love the size, it's perfect for me. I can easily fit it into my purse and carry it anywhere. Also, it runs fast, no lag although I wish I could improve the quality of the camera since I think it is only about 2 megapizels...but overall, I think this product is great and I would highly recommend it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Awesome product. Nicer if the price would be 200 so it can compete with Google's, but all in all, solid tab. Combined with cloud storage or a MyBook Live type of solution, makes a nice media player.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|been using this for like 2 - 3weeks, works great... good processing speed, lots of features and apps. i love it. just having a problem with the battery life. i'm not sure if i conditioned my battery properly, but i get like 2 - 3 hours of full usage. stand by time can be like a couple days, but apps that are logged in log off after some time on standby.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Had a Blackberry Playbook for a year, and decided to try out an andriod tablet. The only thing that I don't like about the galaxy tab is the location of the speakers, if I hold the tablet horizontal my hands muffle the sound, this did not happened on the playbook because the speakers are located beside de screen. And I miss the blackberry bridge function.I like the size of the galaxy tab and the vast selection of apps that the blackberry playbook lacks.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought a packaged deal that included a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, a case, and a 32GB SD card. This is my only complaint so far about this tablet, but for some reason, it appears you cannot move apps to an external SD card, and moving files like photos/video (not sure about being able to move music files) to the SD card requires copying and pasting to the SD card via swapping between folders. You can set your default storage of photos/video via the camera app, but otherwise it's a bit of a chore to move files to the SD card. If you require/want external storage, you probably should look/should have looked into file transferring on this tablet and/or look into another tablet. While I don't plan on taking many photos/recording videos/listening to music on this tablet, I'll just deal with transfers for now. If not being able to easily transfer files is an Android version 4.0.X issue, then idk. I assumed it would be just like the camera app in Android version 2.3.6, which is my Samsung Epic 4G phone's version...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is the second one we purchased and love them. The unit has many many options and works great. It was the perfect choice in a tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It is a great tablet and is easy to use. Has most of the apps that I like and use frequently! Nice Tablet!! Great Price. Love it!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Really nice android 4.0 tablet.I definitely prefer the samsung galaxy tabs than the apple ipads.Also think that samsung could have included the USB ADAPTER within this tablets.Totally recommended
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The tablet Sansung met all my expectations, very good for me to use in my day to day work. I think I made a great purchase.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|this was purchsed for my wife, she seems to like it very well. touch screen appears to be not as responsive as it should be for the price. this is the only reason i gave it a 4
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Pro:Remote feature, I played with this for hours and still get gitty over using itsize, you can hold it in one hand vs the IPAD 2 you have to use 2upgradable, was able to upgrade it 32gb for under 20 using amazon warehousecons:not to many cases made for it, still looking to find a case to keep this safe from my kids
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Received the item today Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi) . Looks great. Small scratch on corner but for a used item it is in great shape. Only downside was that I signed up for text trac which was suppose to send me a text when the item was out for delivery and I did not receive. I am glad the post man thought enough to put it inside the screen door and not leave it out in the open. Maybe it does not work for all forms of shipping. Overall, very happy with the tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought a Nook HD but was severely disappointed when I discovered that there were about 20 apps. Not only does the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 have every single app I've searched for (thanks to the Samsung App Store AND Google Play App Store) but it is easier to use also. I'm a big Apple fan & have used an iPad but I would recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 to anybody looking for a tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I had been using a sub-$100 android tablet and really did like it, but stepped on it. The samsung has a crisper display and is faster than the 'cheap" androids, but what really shocked me is the wifi range. I can now be in my back room 50 feet away, through 5 walls and a closed door and the signal still shows more than half the bars. The cheaper tablet I had would disconnect once I got about 20 feet from the router.Other than that, I was disappointed to find no HDMI out or mini usb. Have to pay $40 for an HDMI adapter.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|excellent product I bought two of theseone for me and one for my partnershe has an ipad but it's huge and unwieldyhowever this is very manageable samsung galaxyyou can take it in one handis perfect
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This product is value for money. Calling facility would have been betterSo far I had a nice experience .
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It's my first tablet, excellent, very good quick to view your documents and very good design and very comfortable when I used to work ..... the full as one says and excellent ...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I decided to buy this over the Google nexus mainly because of the expandable memory. To date,have no complaints.I had the privilege of comparing this with the nexus and to be honest its quite similar. The feature that stood out was clearly the sound quality, way better.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have used for 5 months it has not glitched and is way better than my brothers itouch google play store is awesome and downloads 10 times faster than apple products
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love it. Sold my Ipad just to get back to Andriod. Shiping was on time and it was just as decribed. Glad i bought it. Thumbsup!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Would buy more. Was very pleased at how fast the order came and how nicely packed they were. Looking forward to using them for a very long time!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have been wanting a tablet and doing research for over a year trying to decide which tablet to buy. I finally settled on this tablet for a number of reasons. The user interface is friendly and aesthetically pleasing.I also like the fact that I can add memory with an SD card. Unfortunately the apps cannot be moved to the SD card but it is not something that effects performance or usability.I have my music, photos, books and pdfs on my tablet and I take it everywhere I go.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I don't know what I did without it I can do anything I can do with my laptop.This thing amazing.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Una tablet de excelente calidad. Un precio favorable para las prestaciones t&eacute;cnicas que ofrece. Las actualizaciones se realizan autom&aacute;ticamente, en este momento la tengo con el ultimo versi&oacute;n de Android instalada.La &uacute;nica contra que he encontrado en el dispositivo es que al momento de tomar fotos con mucha luz (luz del sol directa) las im&aacute;genes no aparecen, de lo contrario, todo lo dem&aacute;s funciona a la perfecci&oacute;n.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I like this tablet: Great size, expandable storage, pretty good display.Cons: Stylus helps with just typing!!All in all this tablet good for the price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Good tab, good battery life, can take a beating somewhat been dropped on the floor a couple of times, only thing I wish it had, is a hdmi port.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love my new toy. I take it with me everywhere I go. It is easy to handle and it do not take up a lot of space.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I will rate this as a good product. Only thing, I m missing is 3G. I was too skeptical when I was buying it, since it was my first tablet and price was quite less. And I was adamant that I will buy a Android one only and since I was experimenting, this was the perfect choice. But I was not sure about the quality of product, but now I like it a lot and felt for browsing and reading online books tablet is the best thing and as a result I m switching to my laptop only for programming.I will recommend it to those guys who has wi-fi availability all the time and if u r luking for something really portable. I like 7" more then 10", since carrying 10" is almost like carrying a laptop; in that case I will prefer to carry the laptop.As per the touch screen and other tablet functionalities are concerned I liked it. It is pretty handy. I m using it for more dan a month and I did not face any technical problem so far, somehow I am not able to install "whatsapp", since it require 3G i guess.I will just like to say that it worths more then its price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love my samsung galaxy 2 does all I want and easy to handle fits in my bag perfect and its a great price compared to the apple
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The tablet is the perfect size, fast, nice appearance. However, I wish it was more compatible with other devices. I was using an Acer IConia 10" and I regret not having bought that one, in a smaller size. That one is more compatible, more similar to a netbook; Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 resembles a smart phone, instead.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|lowest priced big brand android tablet that i can find . Building quality is not as good as I expected ,feels like some soft , easy to break plastic case . However , I'm still glad that I can have it to replace my blackberry playbook , there's no useful apps you can find from their only "appworld" ,and angry bird is like $5 for download (free for ios and android) .used the front face camera to video chat with my mom once , it's some pretty good experience . I think I'll find it more and more useful since they have so many awesome apps available .
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Not as powerful as some other 7" models, but more than enough for what I'm using it for - mostly as an aviation GPS, but also as a PDA. Good battery life, screen brightness, decent response times.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was stuck between this or the Kindle Fire, well I am so happy that I bought this tablet! I went to Walmart though since I wanted to physically see and play with it. The price right and I could not be happier!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Tab 2 is a good start off for entering the tablet world. Not too expensive so it's not high end but it's not too cheap to where it's hardware is low quality. It gets slow after running too many apps but theres a widget that brings you to the task manager to close them down. Battery life is good as long as it's brightness is kept on automatic and it's not being turned on every 20-30 seconds while on the road.Apps I commonly use for this:Chrome, Google+, Gmail, Facebook, tumblr, instagram, google music, and google voice.As you can see, I use it for a lot of google based stuff (it's an android thing, y'know?). Social websites run smoothly based on wifi bandwidth. Chrome can open any website/flash animation/gifs no problem, of course with bandwidth kept in mind. Like any other Android device, I recommend a SD card with more than 16GB+ on the side cause this tablet can easiley be a media hub. The screen (7in) is big enough for watching vids in comfort, and the base music app offers some interesting options. Photo app comes with a customizable slideshow option too. Games? vary on what you download. I don't recommend 3D MMO's just cause theres potential for failure and that correlates with the proccessor, not the screen size.One thing I need to mention is it's ability to act as a remote (app pre-installed) to control tv's (samsung only). The reciever for it is on the right hand side of the device. I haven't tried it yet but I guess if you just so happen to have a recent model samsung tv then by all means, go for it. regardless of this semi-useless feature, it's still worth the investment. Plus it fits in my cargo pockets.UPDATE 31JAN13So my I upgraded my Galaxy Tab to 4.1 Jellybean. Theres no real complaints about the new UI from me. I've noticed that now I can multi task while watching a video, though this feature might have always been there. Theres nothing too major to point out and with that in mind I have to say that as long as the tablet isn't overloaded with crap, it'll always run fine. Android devices are only limited by the hardware's potential and this tablet has a lot.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Let me start by saying WOW, what an amazing deal I got on this item! I was in the market for a tablet and wanted to get a name brand tablet running Android OS and I have been a Samsung user ever since I went from the iOS to Android, ANDROID RULES!I picked this one up from Warehouse deals from Amazon for get this $165.00 with free shipping. They described the item as Very Good and let me tell you it was even better! When the package arrived the only thing that didn't look brand new was the original packaging and that was only due to the fact of them repacking the item. When I opened the box the tablet still had what looked to be the original plastic on the screen and chassis. Tablet is perfect not one imperfection to be seen. I would highly recommend if your looking for a deal look no further than warehouse deals! I felt safe knowing that the order was fulfilled by Amazon and that's important when making an online purchase.I could go on and on about this Tablet. It is so much fun to use! Well worth the money this thing is!ProsIR Blaster - super cool!Bluetooth - Stream music on your BT enabled stereo!Android ICS - latest and greatestDisplayBattery Life - very goodConsNone

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love this. After trying several low end tablets. I decided to take a chance and try this one refurbished. I was skeptical but I am not at all disappointed. It came in a brand new authentic box with a seal and it also has a sticker on the back of the tablet that says indicates it is refurbished and has a date. The screen and features are smooth and sleek and it works very well. Battery life is excellent with moderate to heavy usage (games, apps etc). Full access to Google play store (just like a Android phone). Ask me any questions if I did not answer them already.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Only thing I don't like about it is that the screen quality could be better. Other than that, I love it!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It's an awesome little piece of equipment, has everything I was looking for on a tablet and on top of that is very very light and easy to use.

Here are the pros and cons.Pros:Great size, is portible.Samsung and google play content stores.Easy to use.Lightweight.Cons:The screen can not be to bright, otherwise it has very short battery.Over all, this is very good. 5 stars.

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I take the advantage of 1 day shipping and avoid the horrible long line of black Friday. So, I make the purchased on amazon and very please with the shipping process. The tablet it self was awesome, the sensitive of touch seem to be better then the asus TF300 that I had. Well fit and comfort holding. However, the speaker sound as low, I have to bring up the volume quite a good amount, but then again it a tablet not a sub surround sound system like my desktop........Overall, I loved it.The only little problem I ran into was no flash player, but was solve easily when google for alternative solution ....

tablet_galaxy_tab|For months I have been debating about what to purchase: first a nook, then a kindle fire, then was introduced to the Samsung. Decided the Samsung met my needs better. Have it. Love it. Am very pleased with my purchase. (I used the ratings of the different products to help me decide which I would purchase.)

tablet_galaxy_tab|First of all i bought one of these tablet for my wife for here birthday. She loves the tablet. I used the tablet a few times and decided to purchuse one for myself. They have a good picture. They have loud speakers. They play most of the apps that i have downloaded well. I also dropped the tablet onto pavement with no case on it from about 2 feet and it still works great.

tablet_galaxy_tab|There are two kinds of people in the world... ones that have used smartphones and tablets.. and the ones that haven't. The ones that haven't number enough to fit on the head of a pin. I am one of those people. But FINALLY, I'm making the jump into handheld mobile computing, and this Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is working out splendidly. So, a few remarks for anyone else just now jumping off the head of that pin into the 21st century...1) This tablet is awesome. Thumbs up. Absolutely recommend. For the price it is a great value. No reason this should not be a good a choice for newcomers. I figured for $200 if I dump it in a year for something else it would still be a good deal. But I'm sticking with this unit until the technology rolls over (probably about a year ;>).2) It runs the latest version of the Android operating system. The system is not 'locked' as on other hardware sold with Android such as the Kindle. This means maximum compatibility with the apps you wish to install. And believe me, once you have gotten used to the basic functioning of the tablet, it's ALL about the apps.3) Tablet/mobile computing is a life changing experience. Mobile computing is nearly as revolutionary as the Internet itself. I would dare say that mobile computing is more useful in your personal day-to-day life than traditional desktop computing. Desktop computing started in the 'Dark Ages' (DOS, early graphical user interfaces), and proceeded to the "Middle Ages' (evolved operating systems, voice recognition, data sharing, etc), but has basically stalled. Portable computing is the evolutionary leap into the 'Renaissance'. Computers are now beginning to behave the way people who know nothing about computers expect computers to behave (more Star Trek like).4) The 7" form factor is a great size. Not too big. Not too small. I no longer use my iPod Touch to listen to music (except when exercising). I installed the 'TuneSync' app which copied all my iTunes music and playlists to the tablet. And because the tablet is right-sized I tend to take it everywhere. A good portion of the work that used to accomplish on my laptop is performed on the tablet.5) Accessories purchased: Leather case. Also acts as a backstop to prop the tablet up on a flat surface for hands feww viewing (Poetic Slimbook Leather Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 Black. A memory card to expand storage SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP. Both of these have been invaluable. Next purchase will likely be a Bluetooth keyboard.6) There IS a learning curve. This is a different world from desktop computing. Different interface. Different terms and acronyms. Different mind-set. Although you can somewhat intuitively learn the touch based interface and run apps and even download and install new apps, the process of syncing your desktop data with the tablet (music, images, videos, documents) is a WORK IN PROGRESS. The free Samsung application for its tablets that supposedly helps with this is a bit of a joke (Kies). You are sort of left to develop the wheel on your own, so try and hook up with a kid or someone who has figured out how to set up sync media for your tablet, specifically to the external add-on memory card (where there's more room to put everything). That will save you some headaches.---------------------------------UPDATE February 22, 2013: Best way to RootOnce you get your tablet all set up --which can take many many hours of copying songs, photos, videos, etc., plus downloading and configuring apps, plus futzing with various settings, plus arranging all your icons, plus operating system updates-- you want a way to back up EVERYTHING in case you lose your tablet, or whatever. Unfortunately it seems the native Android operating system running on this tablet does not provide a way to back up EVERYTHING. I tried several apps from the app store, the native Google cloud backup, and the Samsung Kies backup... and none of them backed up EVERYTHING. Each of these apps back up a FEW things. For example, none of them backed up my email account settings. I learned that the only way to get a true, full backup is to "root" your tablet. Rooting simply means gaining full control over the Android OS. Rooting can void your warranty, but not having to spend another couple of days redoing everything (assuming I could even remember everything I did) made it worth rooting my tablet. If you choose to the root route here is the best link I found for doing so after quite a bit of research: Wait... ok, the Amazonian Police have removed the links. Just go to the galaxy-tab2 website (add the c-o-m). That's the ticket.Once you have the tablet rooted you want to do that EVERYTHING backup I keep mentioning. Install a free app called "ROM Manger" from ClockworkMOD, which will back up ALL of the main memory card of the tablet (but not the removable external card). For the procedure google 'nandroid backup galaxy tab 2' and look for the link entitled 'How to Perform a Nandroid Backup and Restore it to your Android'.Another useful [free] backup app good for doing SELECTIVE backups and restores (it's wisest to use both) is 'Titanium Backup'.---------------------------------UPDATE February 28, 2013: A few good appsMost of the Samsung supplied apps can be replaced with [usually free] more robust counterparts from the google play store. I did the following:The built-in Gallery app for displaying photos and video doesn't allow much flexibility over the sort order of your photos, so I replaced it with Photo Gallery from Fish Bowl Software.The native Google Play Music app is pretty good, but Rocket Music Player from JRT Studio has a few extras like a sleep timer, an indicator of how many songs are in a playlist, and the ability to specify the media folder. I also installed MixZing because it is one of the few players that can display song lyrics imbedded in the music file (as with iTunes).I use iTunes, and a good app for syncing your library to the tablet is TuneSync from Fireleap software ($5.99 for unlimited version). It copies over songs, playlists, and any "meta data" in the song files such as album art and lyrics.A good non-cloud alternative to the stumbly Samsung supplied Kies app for syncing other data from a computer is Cheetah Sync. The free version will sync one folder on the PC to the tablet. For $2.99 you get unlimited folder sync. A stay away from The Cloud as much as possible so this is a rare find.Other nifty apps are Google Sky Map for viewing and identifying stars. 3D Digital Weather Clock displays weather, date, time, moon phase, and battery charge. Nav Free provides turn-by-turn voice prompted navigation without the need for a wifi connection. Handrite Free allows you to take notes by writing on the tablet with a stylus or your finger. The built in Memo app does a good job for typed notes. ListNote let's you speak your memos and converts them to text. Google Translate for speaking sentences you type in a different language.And many many many more...

tablet_galaxy_tab|excellent, meets my expectations when it comes to quality, functionality and handling of the product, besides the remarkable physical conditions
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this tab as a christmas present fof myself. So far I'm really enjoying it. It runs Skype without glitches, I was able to download veetle and watch shows without any hiccups. The Samsung app world makes it easy to find and download what you're looking for. It's really easy to carry in my purse because of the size. All in all, considering the price I think it's a great buy.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really enjoy my new tablet. It does all I want. It is something I take where ever I go.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The screen is a little small for my eyes but that is not Samsung's fault. I've used this tablet to read email, pay bills, watch Netflix movies and read Kindle books. Works well.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Everything I expected and more verygood tab for the money none respect, a little too sensitivity the touch I have to be careful to keep my fingering in place f
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've been using this tablet for almost a month now... Overall I like the device. I wish using the micro SD card was friendlier to configure in the apps but you can figure out how to have things save there automatically... once setup, nice.For the price, I am enjoying the device would recommend it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought the Samsung Galaxy tab 2 on the day it hit shelves. Coming from a kindle fire that I had lost 2 weeks prior.At first the tablet was slow and lagged on some screens and apps. There have been several updates and I have found it to be a good choice for me.Pros1. Bluetooth2. Removable SD card3. Updates seem to be coming oftenCons1. Battery life seems a bit poor. I get about 4 hours.2. No full size usb,hdmi out.3. Proprietary charger (this one really bugs me).All in all at the time it was a good choice for me. If you do pick this tablet I believe it will be a good choice for you as well.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love my Samsung Galaxy Tab! It is so convenient and easy to carry around instead of a laptop. I use it to store all the specifications and data sheets I need for reference in my job, and it is easy to just pull them up during a meeting and have the answers I need right in front of me. It is great for traveling, since I can download maps and travel guides to use where every I may be going. I can't say enough about how great this device is...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great product, falling short of words to appreciate the design, ease of use...most important VALUE FOR MONEY compared to expensive Apple products..
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love the preloaded apps and downloading apps were also pretty easy. The only problem I have is moving apps to SD card. This little thing would be 10 times better if moving apps to SD card was an option. I bought the 4GB tab because I knew I could have all the space I wanted, with the SD card. I tried google to find ways to move apps and was unable to find anything. The androids 2.3 and above has an app called "app2sd", which will move the app to the SD card. Unfortunately this was the only discrepancy with this tablet. If android fix that problem I would rate it 5 stars
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|BOUGHT THIS FOR A BIRTHDAY GIFT, ARRIVED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, WORKS AWESOME, GREAT FEATURES,EASY TO WORK WITH, VERY EASY TO NAVIGATE, AND THE APPS ARE ENDLESS. PURCHASED MEMORY CARD FOR IT SO MORE THEN ENOUGH MEMORY... WILL PURCHASE FROM SELLER AGAIN. MORE BIRTHDAYS AHEAD...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|So far so good. I've had it for a month now. I mainly use it for reading my email and news. When traveling then I use the built in gps and google maps.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and I must say I'm extremely pleased with it.Pros:1. Right size. Great for games, videos, surfing etc.2. Fast. Android 4 and 1 GHz processor. Amazing. Boots within seconds as well.3. Screen resolution is amazing.4. Good sound.Cons:1. Camera isn't great. But for the price and all the stuff that's loaded, I'm okay with that.2. Doesn't multi-task all that much; cannot run multiple apps at the same time (something I found impressive in the Blackberry playbook), if you don't count pandora.I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone who wants a great one.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet made a great graduation gift! The receiver of the gift is extremely happy with the product. Size is great for portability, no need to pay for extra service to use, lots of fun accessories go with the product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Thank you so much. I love my new tablet, it is my new best friend, I just wish it came with a card like must of them do.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased the seven-inch Galaxy Tab 2, with 8 GB storage on board, and an SD memory card with an additional 32 GB. Of the 8 GB on board, only about 4.5 GB were available, because of space needed by the OS and by preloaded applications. I thought I would be well off, until I discovered that you cannot install anything to the memory card. That is, you can't install applications there or move them there. It's true that you can load your own videos or music there by using perhaps file transfer from your computer. But the apps have to be able to recognize data there. Direct downloads to the device will usually go into on board storage. Only a few apps are set up to write their data where you wish. For example, you can stream your Amazon MP3 music from the cloud; but if you ask the Amazon app to download any of your items, you have no choice as to where they will go.As I understand it, this is a limitation of the Android operating system, and has been true for the last few versions. And there is apparently no way around this. So this is not the fault of Samsung, but it certainly reduces the appeal of the Galaxy Tab 2, which is otherwise an attractive and well-performing unit.

tablet_galaxy_tab|If you are going to spend around 200.00 on a tablet get the Fire HD 7inch at Best Buy and spend the extra 30.00 on the plan because it covers breakage and water damage. My wife has the Fire and its awesome. I got myself Samsung because I am a Samsung snob. It is a good value at 179 but Fire HD 7 is just better.Pros: light weight. os is actually Jellybean now. bright clear screen. battery life is surprisingly long.cons: screen is not gorilla glass. touch isn't very sensitive so stylus doesn't work very well. gets hot while in long use.

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this tablet! Didn't want anything too extravagant, since I have a laptop and a cell phone. This one is perfect for what I use it for (facebook, online site, games, photography apps)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|very good...It still work and Im enjoying it...Hope to do more business with you. i may had made the better of buying with you intead of walmart as walmart one was cheaper..thanks
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I saw this first at Walmart for the sane price. Howevr, they hadn't had it in stick for over 4 months. I was happy to find it here. Although I haven't learned all the features. I'm pleased with it thus far.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I had a Kindle Fire and returned, for an issue with charging. I would say the quality of the Galaxy is a lot better. The charger is better.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is an impressive Tablet. I am really impressed ! I have an Ipad 4 and just bought the Samsung because of the low price, but now I am loving it.So many functions, apps and compact ! I am a big fan of Samsung now ( can't wait for the Galaxy S4, although I already have the iphone 5).However, make no mistake, it is great but the Ipad is still better. Mainly because the touch screen is more responsive. Putting that aside, they ate both excellent .I think Samsung at making innovations and Apple is great in improving them ( making them near perfect).
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got 2 refurbished. Unfortunately, I had to send them back, but I really like how they work and they're very useful for the things you need. The seller is way awesome! They understood my concerns about them and gladly helped me out. This is my first product I purchased from them. Even though it didn't work out they way I wanted, I am for sure going to buy from the seller again.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love my Galaxy SIII Phone, so I got this as a backup plan when I wanted to be tech-y in a bigger format. It's perfect in every way.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this item because it has a microsd card slot; the Google Nexus 7" that I have - which I love - does not. And I wanted the extra storage capacity. I shipped the unit back to Amazon today for several reasons, but the biggest is that the screen gave off an unbelievable amount of heat somewhere in the 1+ hour range of video watching. It was just weird - at first I didn't know what was going on because I have the Nexus and the Samsung Tab 2 10" and neither have this problem. I had noticed battery life isn't nearly as good as the Nexus but I didn't track that very closely. The heat, though - let's face it, if a unit is giving off heat, that means the battery is draining at uber speed. Plus, the screen should not be emitting heat - not in a small tablet, or even a big one, for that matter. I searched the Net and saw the issue mentioned in some other Samsung devices - phones, mostly, I believe. Make sure to check this out before ordering. The Galaxy Tab 2 7" feels flimsy next to the Nexus - which I now love even more than before. Sometimes extra weight is good - it means the product is made well with good materials - and will last longer. I like my Samsung Tab 2 10" very much - this also accepts a microsd card so I guess I'll be using that when I need more storage. In short: buy the Nexus 7, not the Galaxy Tab 2 7.

tablet_galaxy_tab|the Samsung galaxy tab 2 (7 inch, wi fi) is good, no have problema. thans. i loveeeee for reeeeeeeevvvvvvvvverrr men
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Samsung Galaxy Tab was purchased as a gift for my grandson and he love's it. Samsung quality at a great price. cant beat it!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this tablet for two reasons - it was cheap but seemed well-made, and I prefer the Android OS over iOS. I use it mainly for note-taking in class (I am a first-year nursing student) and it works well. The Android app store, though lacking in some places, offered many choices for PDF annotation (what I use to take notes) but to anyone who needs this for PDF annotation purposes, look no further than the free Adobe Reader app. The functionality and interface is perfect and the app I paid $4 I deleted after a few days.The tablet is perfect for watching videos and playing games, as well as taking notes. I wish I would have bought the larger, 10.1-inch version, though, because 7 inches is just a little on the small side for taking notes.The touch screen is iffy at times if you use a stylus - I would suggest springing for a nice one with a large pad. My cheap stylus sometimes doesn't register well and can make writing illegible. I have tried using my cheap stylus on my roommate's iPad, though, and it worked well - it's clearly the Tab's touch screen that is the problem.Overall a good tablet, but I would suggest students purchase the larger version.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Great tablet I love the size of it, personally feel this is better than the ipadBattery:5/5Screen display:4/5Sound: 3.75/5Size:5/5I woukd recomend this tablet to anyone wanting to get a tablet that doesnt want to spend double the price on an ipad

tablet_galaxy_tab|Got this for Christmas and LOVED it for two weeks. Believing all updates improve your device I allowed an update, which I was to find chaged my tablet from ics to jelly bean. I Hated it. Lost screenshot button, nbd, but annoying. Then I found adobe flash was gone, not nbd, I was angry now. Add to that a few other little annoying changes and I now hated this device. Look into the msg boards to determine if these changes are game changers for you. I traded it up for the 1o in. Which has jb also but a better version than the 7in. I hate how big it is and Im still undecided. If the 7 in was EXACTLY like the 10 I would go back to it, for now Im reviewing my options. Bad move Samsung. You ruined a perfect device. P.s. some really cool folks atandroid central posted a link that allows you to load flash on your device but you need a micro sd to save it to.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was happy with the tab 2 for about 2 months. It stopped holding a charge and now it won't even accept a charge. My kids have the Kindle Fire HD, which is the main competitor for the Tab 2. The Kindle has been outstanding. I'll update this review after going through the service process.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this very affordably priced tablet to bring to work with me (slow-paced third shift job with lots of down time). One week later and I love this tablet. The battery life is great! From turn on to the time the device powered itself off was 9.5 hours, and that was with near constant use. The entire time I was connected to WiFi, running trillian, surfing the internet, using various apps on and off, and all with no task killer app. I thought that was pretty amazing, but this is my first tablet.So far I am digging the heck out of my tablet. I find the infared red blaster and pre-installed smartpeel app really novel; I quite enjoy being able to quickly switch between whatever I happen to be browsing and a tv guide type app and change the channel to whatever my heart desires. But like I said, it's just a novel addition and I am sure I wouldn't miss it if the device didn't have an infared blaster. I wish there was more internal storage, but for $50 more than the kindle (a device that relies on a cloud service for storage) and microsd card slot, whateva. I also find that the keyboard leaves something to be desired, but the app market takes care of that.In summation, if you are debating between this and another tablet, or find yourself overwhelmed by all the options available to you, just suck it up and buy this tablet. Most likely you won't regret it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am writing this on the tab itself so please do forgive any grammatical errors everyone has to be more than adequate job describing the tablet so I will not elaborate I will just say I have had the tablet for 10 days and for a first time tablet buyer I absolutely love this purchase no regrets
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My first tablet but my second Android device. My first is an LG Ally smartpone(Android 2.2.2).Using that for almost the last 2 years I've learned what limitations that hardware has with the software.The Ally was an entry-level smartphone with the bare minimum to run Android. Even with a large SD card I often get a "getting low on phone memory" notice. The deal is That you can not run apps from the SM card. Apps run from the "phone"'s built in memory only.With this being my experience with an Android device upgrading to a Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 was very pleasant. It works and has not choked on anything I've tried on it. I've loaded everything I had on my Ally plus Skype and I still have over 4 Gigs free on the internal memory. Another nice point is that there isn't a lot of bloatware taking up resources (if I wanted Facebook on it I can download the app, Thanks Samsung!).7 inch screen is nice on all accounts, the form factor works for me, I would think the 10 inch would be too big to carry around all the time. I've watched a few movies streamed from Netflix and it was enjoyable. The speakers on this are better than the ones in my 15 inch Acer Laptop, they actually have base!Could I have spent more for better specs on a tablet? Sure but I don't think I could have gotten a better value. It has the resources to do what I want it to do.Grips:1) Why is the On/Off button on the side? I'm still learning how to hold the thing and being new I'm often accidentally hitting it, putting it in screensaver mode, why not have it on the front?2) Battery life is good unless I turn on the GPS. I may want to get a charger for it in the car.3) I would like to be able to use this outdoors sometimes. It's gloss. Got a Matte screen protector and that helps with the glare. That is the one thing I liked about the ad for the original Kindle (Electric paper) You can read it while on the beach, That's the trade-off for having a color screen, It's the Physics.I'm very happy with this. One of the justifications for getting this is that my contract with Verizon is comming up and I'm wondering if I can drop my Data plan (Why am I paying over $500 a year for data) when most of the time I'm in range of wifi anyway. This just may be able to save me alot of money in the long run and I can do more with it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|i had own a galaxy tab 7.0($399)and kindle fire($199). Both are great tablets but either of it has come the the new Tab2. first tab is way to expensive with even with 16g memory. kindle fire is cheap but still too slow for ICS.Galaxy Tab 2 has set a new margin for tablets. its only $50 more than kindle fire and with ICS system. it has 1g of ram and faster processor, which is great for some good quality games. even two camera front and back. i know sumsung could do a better job on the cameras. i really loved it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Good evening, This is my first dive into the tablet market, I have over the years played around the the various kindles, nooks, android, BlackBerry and the Ipads, they for the most part were very impressive except for the price. and I wasn't about to contract a 4g account on one of these. So being a owner of a iPhone 3g, HTC EVO 4g, and my current Samsung Exhibit 2, I felt I needed a bigger screen for my aging eyes, This device does the trick and its easily portable one of the main reason I chose this over a Transformer.My views of this device through the eyes of a previous user of a Iphone and a Android phone, out of the box it appeared as a large hand size smart phone, the button inputs seem to be it the right place, the back is a little slippery, this must a Samsung thing, my exhibit 2 sometimes is like trying to hold a wet bar of soap, . I didn't have any problems syncing my Google account.I did manage to get the peel remote to work with my U verse, Samsung TV and RCA 5.1 stereo, I think the interface is a little quirky, the controls are strange and a little cumbersome, it also has a bunch of program suggestions, none that I like. I'm sure in time there will be better apps out there for the IR blaster.speaker sound is pretty good, you will probably want to use headphones or ext speakers anyway.the camera is sub par, it does have rapid shoot, and panorama that works really well, sorry, no digital zoom. at least I could not find that setting, the video is so so, grainy and dark nuff saidI had pretty good luck with the battery, watched 5 episode of Lost on Netflix, downloads apps surfed the web etc, my data usage for that day was about 5+gigs and I had about 27% battery left.I'm actually a fan of the power connector only because I broke off the power socket on my EVO 4g with the mini usb plug, so i will side with the world of physics and go with more surface area contact the less chance of being snapped off.Apps: youtube works just fine, easy to navigate the tube, I use Waze for GPS, works perfectly, no probs with slacker radio or netflix, but beware HULU is not supported on this device, like about half of the other android devices out there, works on my evo but not on my exhibit? .... the S calendar is awesome, I use Jorte on my phone but I think this is a little bit better.no major gripes with this device. it suits all my needs
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|As an Apple family, I decided to see how the galaxy compared. It is very comparable. My wife has no complaints as she can do facebook, email, read books and the few games she plays. My kids won't use it as the small selection of apps does not include the ones they want. Bottom line is the tablet works fine and is 1/3 the price of the ipad, just make sure you are satisfied with the apps offered by it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Had a Kindle Fire, this is my first full android tablet. It works great, the 7 inch screen is perfect for me. I bought it in March of 2013 and it said it came with Android 4.0, but for my surprise, it came with 4.1 right out of the box. I've been using it for 2 weeks, all the aplications I downloaded are up and working, it hasn't crashed so far and user interface is more that ease to use. Like the fact that you can customise it the way you want, it makes it more personal. So far, I'm loving it!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great Tablet. I think that everyone in the entire world should have one of this. Good work Samsung on your wonderful tablet
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Fast and reliable wi-fi.Apps are fun and easy to access.Memory storage is more than enough.Easy to handle.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I picked this up for a friend, who is very computer illiterate. So I was involved in the set up of the product. I have an ipad 2 and a Lenovo Ideapad in my household, so that is what I am comparing it to. I like the screen, very nice display - YouTube was crystal clear when I played it. I felt the touch screen was very responsive, for the most part. No better or worse than my other tabets. I found setting it up was very intuitive and that downloading apps would be simple for a person who is not used to that type of thing. Since I own tablets with larger screens, I was concerned that I would hate the smaller screen. But I felt that if I had to go with something like that - it wouldn't be a problem. I may use a stylus on a screen that size at time, but it didn't feel like it would have been as big of an issue as I originally thought. All in all, for my limited use and set up of the item, I feel like if it was my product, I would have been happy with it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have the Samsung Galaxy 7 gen1. So I figured the Samsung Galaxy 7 gen2 would be better. Not so. It has all of the bells and whistles and it has a nice screen. You can read kindle/amazon books but. This is what makes me very unhappy. I have a 32g micro sdcard. Download ebooks on it. Samsung Galaxy 7 gen2 will not let you open them. You have to use the Reader Hub to open ebooks if they are not Amazon books, it does not give you an option to open the ebooks on your ext sdcard. I have surfed the internet for 2 days and have come across posting that tells you it can not be done. I am not downing Samsung. I have the Samsung Galaxy 10 gen1 and the Samsung Galaxy SIII Phone and a 46" Samsung TV plus the Samsung Galaxy 7 gen1. So no way am I downing Samsung. If someone can tell me how to open ebooks from the Ext SD Card before tomorrow (10-19-2012) then I would be more then glad to keep it. The other problem I have with the Samsung Galaxy 7 gen2. When I am more then 15' from my wireless Router the internet is dropped. I have the Kindle Reader, Kindle Fire gen1, and all of the above tablets and they all stay connected up to 40-50 ft.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|So I waited to write a review on this tablet to see how well it handled. The battery life is good, if you turn off wifi when there is none around and bluetooth when you don't need it, the tablet lasts most of the day. I like the fact that you are not restricted to use Android App market. The peel app is nothing to write home about, kinda disappointing. I like the internal GPS the larger screen is safer while I am driving and it doesn't tie up my phone. Very enjoyable tablet and would recommend, its not the most powerful one on the market, but consider what you want to use it for.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I compared Galaxy tab against the new iPad and the Google Nexus tab. iPad- good screen, looks sleeker, but heavy, hard to hold, more $$$. Google Nexus tab - cheaper initially but with tax + shipping (mandatory) cost almost the same, plus no rear camera or microSD slot. Galaxy tab feels good in my hands, works smoothly, and is priced well. I have iPhone4 and touch response on Galaxy tab seemed less smooth initially, compared to iPhone. But I got used to it eventually and I can use both devices well. I got software upgrade x2 after I received it and it is working very smoothly. I am very satisfied with my purchase.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had this tablet for about a month and I absolutely LOVE IT! I got it because I couldn't afford an ipad, and the Samsung Galaxy has not disappointed me. It does everything I need it to do. I can check my email, get on facebook, play my favorite games, use it as a reader, and listen to music. I also use it with some of the autistic kids I work with. It is a great size and is easy for them to opperate, too. All of the apps that I would have wanted for an ipad have been available to me on this android. I love being able to take pictures and video, too. The Galaxy Tablet is only about $50 more than a kindle, but it does so much more. Don't hesitate! You won't be disappointed!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I made the mistake of buying a Nook Tablet last year, and it has mainly gathered dust. The limited app selection was really a killer for me. The Galaxy Tab is perfect. Being able to access the Android store is great. Got through the setup and SW updates with no issues. Downloaded several apps, copied a ton of music and tested playback from my microSD, watched multiple TV shows using Netflix and HBO GO and a movie from my own collection...flawless. Sound through headphones is really great. Video is very high quality in my opinion. I am a loyal Samsung customer, and this product lived up to my expectations. Only problem is that I paid $20 more at a local retailer because I didn't want to wait for 2-day shipping over the weekend!

tablet_galaxy_tab|Let me begin this review by saying that this is the best tablet that i ever used!!!!!!! What I mean by that is that this tablet is extremely fast and responsive. I been using Apple products for many years now, and this tablet by FAR superior to any Apple tablet that I have used. Battery life is very long, I get app 8-9 hrs of heavy use before I need to charge it again. Screen is bright and very crisp, and for 7in tablet that is purely AMAZING!!!! This tablet supports FLASH, which apple does not. Yes you need to download it from other source since Adobe stopped the support for tablets with 4.0+ OS, but it only takes few minutes and very easy to do even for me. External memory slot is a definite plus in my book, since you can add music and movies to your SD, without using your internal memory for those items. The last thing is the price, for a new tablet 250$ it is relatively cheap, apple is 2x that so this was a SUPER deal in my opinion. People compare Galaxy Tab2 with the new Nexus 7 which is 199$ in GOOGLE store, but they don't take into consideration that GOOGLE will charge them 199$ for the tablet + tax + like 20$ for shipping, and that's the price for 8gig model with NO MICRO SD CARD SLOT!!!! Yes for some people that might be a great deal since its faster, but you get much more for the buck when you purchase Samsung Galaxy Tax 2 7.0!!!!!!!!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I read multiple reviews about this tablet, the Kindle fire and the Nook before deciding on the Samusung. I have to say I am, overall,very happy with my purchase. However, this item has one major flaw. The internet browser constantly shuts down and returns me to the home page for no reason. It does not happen every time I use the internet, but often enough.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tablet so I can't compare it to others but I did do a ton of research before buying. The critical features were size, the 10 inch just isn't portable enough, memory expansion slot, everyone wants the SD slot but few pads have them, front and rear facing camera, android market, and speed. The Galaxy Tab 2 had all of this at half the price of an IPad which I understand is the industry standard.I've had it about a week and have no complaints. I've been able to do everything I expected to do and more. the camera is not great but It's mainly used for fun photo's. You can't get great pics from a micro lens I don't care what anyone says. So I have a real camera for pictures that I want to look great. This is just for taking snaps as I go along of stuff I want to show someone.The battery has no problem lasting all day long. I've watched 2 hour long shows on Netflix back to back after a regular day of occasional use and the battery still had juice so I believe watching a movie or some other extended video display would be no problem.The only really odd thing is that I use linux based operating systems at work and home and this thing won't interface with it, even though it IS a linux operating system. That's just wrong. It has no problems interfacing with Windows and I was able to drag and drop music and movies onto the tablet.I'm very happy with the purchase but the real test is how long will this thing last.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Ive always had an ipad, ive had all 3, but when i saw the very first commercial for the galaxy tab after the first ipad, i instantly wanted one, but decided to wait. I finally got this,and this is amazing! Its the perfect* size!!! Its not too thin like the ipad. When you hold it, you dont feel like your going to break it (like the ipad). I love the design, software, and everything about this device! Not too thin, not too thick. "The Goldy Locks Tablet"Pros: Size, Wieght, Thickness, Battery, DesignCons: Gets kind of slow, when a lot of things are running, cameras

tablet_galaxy_tab|I own a Motorola Xoom, a Kindle Fire, and the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. Of these the GT2 7.0 is definitely my favorite. The interface is smooth and slick. It is so well finished that it epitomizes what Android should be. It is what the Kindle Fire should have been. It includes a GPS, Bluetooth, MicroSD slot, front and rear cameras and only costs $50 more than a Kindle Fire! Totally worth it. If this is what Android tablets are today I can't wait to see what Samsung will bring to the game next year. The only downside is that this tablet is so new that it's tough to find accessories for it. A lot of the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus accessories will fit for now, but that gap shouldn't take too long to close given Samsung's market popularity.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought for my wife and thought I'd use it more; but once she saw what the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 could do, she uses it for everything. Long battery life, even when you have the screen on for hours. Fast processing speeds, decent amount of memory (recommend you add an SD card). No regrets.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this unit a few weeks ago. I own several unbranded Asian Android tablets. They all work well but they all have limited battery life so I bought the tab. Samsung in general makes solid devices and this is well built but one big thing that sold me is their help line. If you have questions or problems a quick call gets a actual person and assistance. Not too knock Google or ASUS but calling either about the Nexus 7 is a nightmare. For pure horsepower go with the Galaxy Tablet 7.0. Its older but more powerful. The second and most important things is too ROOT your devices and that includes phones and replace the stock ROM with a custom ROM.The good: Decent performance overall. Mini SD slot. Good build quality and rear facing camera. Great speakers. Great customer service.The bad: 8gb of internal storage? C'mon Samsung start with 16gb. Average screen. No mini USB connection. It uses a proprietary Samsung connector.Comparison to other tablets: The Nexus 7 16gb or 32gb. The Nexus 7 has a beautiful screen that is sharper then the Galaxy.Should you buy it? I'm on the fence and I like Samsung in general. If the Nexus 7 had better customer service, sure. Google problems with the Nexus and you'll see. If you buy the Galaxy via Ebay or otherwise you get 90 days warranty. Nothing with the Nexus.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is excellent and works great. My sons is absolutely happy with it and that to meis rewarding enough. Keep it up Samsung

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is great!!! I like the fact that it has a camera, samsung apps, google play store, and the memory storage of up to 32 gigs.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this product as a birthday gift for my husband. He wanted a product he could play games on, surf the web and check e-mail when he was away from his computer without the expense of purchasing a laptop. This tablet filled the bill. It's lightweight and easy to use. A great product for the price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great 7inch tablet. I just wish it came with more that 8GB of storage. I have added a MicroSD card but google play and music and other apps all store things on the internal memory. Samsung has a great interface they put on over the android which is very useful. Based on my experience with this tablet I think my next phone purchase will be a samsung (currently I am using a motorola droid bionic). Battery life is reasonable, the only downside is it doesn't use a microUSB to charge - but that hasn't been a huge issue. The size is great because I use this tablet at work for many things and it fits in the back of my pocket when I am walking around (just remember to take it out of your pocket when you sit down).
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this tablet and am glad that I lopted for this one instead of the Kindle Fire HD, preforms real well!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a pretty good device I use it for just about everything. I think this would b a great gift for anybody

tablet_galaxy_tab|After a weak experience with a Nexus 7 that failed after but a short drop (in its protective case) from four feet, I decided to give the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-inch) a try, to see whether it was better made and workable for me. My Galaxy Tab 2 came with Android Jelly Bean already installed, so it is a recently-produced unit.Here's a quick summary of the pros and cons of the Galaxy Tab 2:PROS- It's made and supported by Samsung. (The Nexus 7 is sold as a Google product, but hardware support comes from ASUS while software support comes from Google.)- Well-liked device with a good 10 months of history behind it now.- Long battery life (10-12 hours claimed)- Fast enough (dual core CPU)- Expandable memory (to 32GB) via microSD- IR port for use as a remote- forward AND rear-facing cameras- The unit feels sturdy in the handCONS- The active-matrix organic LED (AMOLED) display has a green cast to it; it's noticeable with white backgrounds and movies.- Screen resolution is now middle-of-the-pack at 1024x600 (about 170 dpi), versus the 1280x800 (about 215-220 dpi) of the Nexus 7.- Touch screen is not very sensitive compared to Nexus 7 and iPad.- Processing power, while adequate, lags the Nexus 7 with its quad-core CPU.- The forward-facing camera is VGA resolution (640x480=300k pixel) versus the Nexus 7's 1.3 megapixel. On anything bigger than a phone, you'll notice the lack of resolution.- The rear-facing camera offers weak performance.- Uses Samsung-proprietary connector rather than a standard USB port on the tablet. (Nexus 7 uses microUSB.)In view of my experience with the Nexus, I really did want to like the Samsung. After living with it for several days, though, I simply kept noticing its deficiencies relative to the Nexus 7. The screen resolution is the most noticeable thing. Smaller fonts on the GT2 show a marked blockiness and, for my mid-40s eyes, are harder to read. The additional resolution on the Nexus 7, while still not up to the standard set by Apple's Retina display, made the screen much easier on my eyes. Further, the green cast on my GT2 (which others have noticed, based on my web searches for a solution, to no avail) makes reading e-books and watching Netflix movies less pleasant.Then there's the matter of touch-screen sensitivity. You'll only notice this one if you've used a more sensitive device, like an iPad or the Nexus. However, I routinely had to touch and wiggle a finger-tip to get the GT2 to recognize a press. Flipping pages in an e-book was a bit hit-or-miss, as was adjusting volume, scrolling, or playing a card game. The Nexus and iPad are simply better here.I could live with the slightly lower performance of the GT2, but that, too, is noticeable, if you've used a higher-performance unit. Animations are a little slower, hiccups are more frequent, etc.Don't get me wrong. The Galaxy Tab 2 is a nice tablet, sturdily constructed and with attention to details from a major manufacturer, especially for the price in April *2012*. But we're almost a year past that now. For about $200, you get a GT2 with 8GB of flash, but that's not as a good a value as the competition is now offering, especially if the IR or a weak rear-facing camera isn't important to you. (Bringing your GT2 to its maximum 32GB via microSD will put you within about $20-$30 of the Nexus 7 32GB, and within $100 or so of the iPad mini 16GB.) It's time for a Galaxy Tab 3.UPDATE: I have attempted to write a balanced review of this tablet. Others may disagree with what I've written, but consider my points before answering the question "Was this review helpful to you?" The question is not "Do you agree with this reviewer?" but "Was it helpful?" If each review praised and gushed about a product, it wouldn't be very helpful, would it? Even less helpful is the "I like this product. U must get one 2." review.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this tablet because I love my Samsung phone so much thinking this would perform just like my phone. Wrong! Went to one of my favorite websites to read and the screen would go blank after about a minute. Thinking my favorite website might be having some issues for a moment I went to another website and started reading and the same thing happened. I sat beside my router and the same thing kept happening. My phone and Nook tablet have no problem keeping a signal anywhere in my house. This tablet is going back after one day of use. Very disappointed Samsung!!

tablet_galaxy_tab|muy buen producto, es excelente para poder hacer todo tipo de tareas y facil de manejar ademas de comodo. GOOOD!!

tablet_galaxy_tab|It is serving the purpose for which I purchased it. I do not need something really fancy. Until I get more savy it will be just fine.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Producto original de excelente calidad. Entrega rapida, excelente precio, excelente equipo, muchas caracteristicas y memoria de 8 gb. Lo recomiendo
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I will write more later after a few months. Great service. Organization of owner's manual is a little strange. (Yes I printed it out - that's fine - I want to pay for the electronics, not paper).
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased a larger tablet with WiFi and cellular connectivity before getting this small tablet with only WiFi. I have a Samsung smartphone so I thought the interface would be similar. It is but it is so different from my other tablet that I confuse myself when using it. HeheheIt is lightweight and slightly larger than a paperback book. I will use it more as a reader rather than an actual tablet because I didn't get cellular with it. I only need to remember to download books when I have a WiFi connection which I failed to do when I went out the other day and wanted to read on it. Needless to say, I downloaded books immediately when I got home and that won't happen again.I also note that I can change the font size on books downloaded from my Kindle app but cannot change fonts on .pdf files that I have imported into Kindle. Again, maybe I just haven't figured out how to use it.It as a microSD card port but I can't get it open. I have ordered a card reader so I can use a flash drive and SD card if I ever wish to download something from the Galaxy Tab. Also, the screen fades when I use it at times and I haven't figured out why or how to change this feature.For the price, this is a nice size tablet if you don't need cellular.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I expected the 7.0 tablet to be a larger version of my Samsung Galaxy Player 4.0. It seems to have been designed by a different team or at a different time, because the interface is different. Maybe this is because it uses a different version of Android.I plan to use this tablet as a replacement for my travel laptop (a Fujitsu Lifebook P1620) Email application seems to work fine.---I found my Samsung Galaxy Player 4.0 with 4" screen fine for travel.I took both the 4.0 and 7.0 on a recent trip, and used the smaller Samsung for all but reading ebooks. The 4.0 screen is too small for reading books. I took pictures with the 4.0 Samsung, and posted the photos to Facebook. I did not find it necessary to write emails.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Quiet like it so far, easy to use. Better than the samsung galaxy 2 phone. Way better than comparable tablets.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The product is good. But it's battery performance sucks. It takes 4-5 hours to charge the battery completely. And of you are charging through you laptop then the times goes upto 5-6 hours. This is very discouraging. This was my first android and Samsung product. I checked in Google and found it is common issue with many android product. My blackberry and iphone were pretty fast in recharging.However, except battery this is good product to buy. Processor is fast and you can extend the storage memory uptown 32 gb which will cost you another just $20-25 . Smooth touch screen and independence of iTunes to sync your tab for pics and songs with any laptop. That was the main reason to buy android tablet.Prons :less priceExpandable memoryEasy to hold in one hand and typingIndependence of iTunes. (Easy to transfer pics, songs, movies).Cons:Long time to recharge battery.

tablet_galaxy_tab|i love it, will certainly recommend it to other people. price is very cheap. the tablet is perfect for everyday use.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My review was accidentally published under the Samsung Galaxy 2 - 7 inch tablet. I have NO experience with the second generation iteration of the tablet and cannot comment on it. I LOVE the first generation version! It has served me well for several years now. Please read my review for THAT device.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great tablet. I love it. Works great with my tv & digital set top box. Fast, snappy. 10/10.Cameras are good. Only 4gb of memory allocated to apps so a Micro SD would be needed for a heavy app & video downloader like myself.Purchased Syba CL-CAB62033 USB 2.0 Adapter for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 from Amazon along with this tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I needed a tool for work and this tab is excellent the size is convinient not too big or small, quick response. I have a bb torch to read my emails and I have to move a lot to read them. I can easily login to my bank and check my balance too. Facebook, google apps, polaris office runs good. I am happy with it! This model does not have sim card , only wi fi, but that costs $200 MORE.. Hope this helps you !
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is amazing! I absolutely love it . For what I paid for it I really get a lot out of it . I purchased a 32 gig sd card so that I could get a lot more apps, however it turns out I don't need it because the tablet has great internal storage, which is a problem with other things on the market.I use it every day, it is like my new toy. I absolutely love it for business, for fun, for whatever you need... it is great! I highly recommend this tablet!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've been wanting a tablet for some time, and didn't want to spend an arm and a leg. One of the best selling points for this for me was the size and the fact that even though it comes with 8gig of memory, with roughly 4 used for the os and pre-installed software, I can ADD a 32gig card, which is what I did.It's quick and does what I want and need.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really like this product and wich I could have had the bigger screen. It's easy to use and there is always a way to find out what you don't know.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|first of all, this is my first Android device. I own a lot of Apple products. This Samsung is the perfect size for what I needed. I wanted something smaller then the Ipad for bed and just relaxing on the couch with it. It fits in your hand well and easy to use. I'm not a huge Android OS fan, but its growing on me. The screen could be a little better in terms of clarity, but for what I use it for, it's acceptable. The device is speedy, it does delay here and there typing. Doesn't bother me much. I haven't found anything I dislike about the device that would discourage me from buying another for the house. Definitely happy with my purchase.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I played with one of these today at the Coast Guard Exchange and was very impressed. It sat along side several other higher priced tablets (7" and 10") and performed a lot better than the others. The speed was pretty good (of course, that depended on the store's wi-fi). I had been looking at the New Kindle Fire HD, but might just go for this device, instead. Every app that I tried to find was in Google Play (most low-end Androids don't even have Google Play) and every website that I searched came up quickly. I will update this review after I have bought one and tried it out for a few months. But, my first impression was very good.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this tablet months ago when they first came out, and pretty much totally satisfied/happy with it. It has become real competition for the others and has set a new standard in quality and price. Excellent quality high resolution screen and works well. Not perfect, but close to it. I did have one problem, when using Angry Birds Rio (free version). It would re-cycle back and start over again during play. By researching blogs I found the solution. TURN ON AIRPLANE MODE during play, and the problem is gone. I have a 16GB microSD memory card in it, have downloaded 4 full length movies so far and they look great. I would recommend a 32GB card since it will accept it. This tablet is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. (This review updated December 31, 2012.)

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my 2nd "touch' device after my iPod Touch 4gen and it has certainly been a learning experience. A few negatives future buyers might like to know:Doesn't include headphones or FM antennae (Galaxy Players include them); the built in camera app doesn't work outdoors after update to 4.0.4 (it still does video and other camera apps work though); the 3mp rear camera doesn't have a flash or auto-focus (picture quality is only on par with the 1mp rear iPod camera); the WiFi connectivity, though adequate so far, is not as good as the iPod Touch; the IR port "Peel" app is very limited so don't buy this thinking you are getting a universal remote; it is nearly impossible to find a TPU, silicone gel or hard case for the Tab 2, only big leather type coversWhat $199 does get you vs. some other $199 devices:A functioning GPS (no GPS antennae in the $299 iPod Touch 5 or $199 Kindle Fire HD); a wall plug ($20 extra for KF HD); a rear camera and microSD slot (not on either KF HD or Google Nexus)iOS 5.0 vs Android 4.0.4:It has taken me several days to learn Android, it's about the same difference as PC vs. Mac I suppose (I hate MacOS and Finder). There are several apps missing I would like as everyone has noted elsewhere, and the "same' apps don't all work the same. I do like all the info Android makes available in settings and options which puts you in control, but if you want to sit back and enjoy the ride iOS might be more for you.EDIT: The iPad mini was just announced at $329 without GPS, similar screen resolution (1024x780) and better camera, but probably too wide to hold in my hand, so I'm still ok buying this for $199. If the mini were $229 I might have had regrets.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is the second brand new Galaxy Tab 2 (7" model)that has not worked properly in one week. Amazon delivery and CS has been excellent but the performance of the unit and Samsung's CS sub-standard. I had great hopes based on Samsung's good name and the Tab's great features for the price. Being that this is a Wi-Fi model, I am rating it poorly because of it's inability to connect me to the internet.I have linked multiple devices, laptops and smart-phones using various OS to my Wi-Fi Network w/out ANY glitches, BUT the Galaxy Tab couldn't yield a real/true connection. I am versed in setting up Networks and Wi-Fi connections, and Samsung's CS asked me twice to send the unit back calling it faulty. Two brand new units ? Let's get real! Unfortunately I can't stop to come to the conclusion that something in the hardware or software is not being able to fully connect with Wi-Fi's properly. I am using an N router and tried many ways to resolve the issue. From the beginning the Tab would identify the signal with the correct SSID and reported a strong signal and was unable to obtain the IP address and was not able to connect. I followed their suggestions by a) manually entering my network b) resetting the tab and c) entering the network spec's w/ a Static mode. All along the security password was recognized and secured. When using the static option I was finally able to achieve a connected status ( a short lived yeah!). While under "connected" status I was NOT able to truly connect to the internet or a google account, either the one I have been using, or even creating a new one. I spent 2.5 hours combined between phone CS and Chat CS to end up with their advise to return the unit and get a replacement.I have wasted enough time and will not get a Samsung Galaxy Tab. I honestly wish it would have worked, but if it is going to be this hazzle on a perfectly good network/WiFi set-up I don't want to waste more time and/or have this degree of difficulty when trying to link to other networks. Under the CS guidance we even switched my N Router to the b & g modes and it failed as well.I am again on the research mode to see which 7" Tab to get?? I don't like to bash a manufacturer and am hoping that this is a glitch that Samsung will correct. It has been a very wasteful experience; my time and Amazon's money absorbing the shipping costs! One of Samsung's CS said to me that my case was not unique, that he has seen other reports of inability of the Tab to connect with some WiFi's.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Got this one couple of days back. Battary doesnot last long. The wifi has lot of issues, it some times connects and some times not. I have other mobile devices same place working well on wifi..but this Tab didnot work...I am going to return this...

tablet_galaxy_tab|I've owned or worked with 4 different 7" Android OS tablets. When choosing a tablet it's all about what you will use it for. I like the Acer Iconia A110 the most because it has the most "utility". It's sort of the jack of all trades of these devices. It may not do anything the best but it can do the most. I hope that makes sense. I hope my review will help you choose your tablet. Here's the comparisonsAcer Iconia A110 - $199Pros - GPS, HDMI Out, Micro SD card slot, Google PlayCons - Screen Resolution 1024 x 600, Speed is just a tad bit slower than the others,the device is physically thicker and more bulky than the others.Notes: This would be a 5 star product if it had a better screen. Only 8GB internal storage without adding a micro SD card. I am able to stream amazon flash based videos by downloading a different browser than the stock chrome. This device runs Android OS 4.1 (Jelly Bean)Kindle Fire HD - $199Pros - Performance Speed, HDMI Out, Amazon Instant Video, Screen Resolution 1280 x 800Cons - No GPS, No Micro SD Card Slot, No Android Market/Google Play (Amazon Market only by default), Have to purchase wall charger separately, Layout isn't the standard Android OS GUI. Amazon has created their own UI.Notes: Excellent product but the lack of GPS and micro sd card slot is disappointing. The amazon based apps (kindle books & video etc..) have a wonderful UI in comparison to the other 3 devices. 16GB internal storage for the same price as the others is better value. This device is very "sleek" This device runs Android OS 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) under the Amazon Kindle GUI.Google Nexus 7 - $199Pros - Performance Speed, GPS, Screen Resolution 1280 x 800, Google PlayCons - No Micro SD card Slot No HDMI OutNotes: Great product would easily be the best unit if they added HDMI out and a micro sd card slot. This device has 16GBs of storage like the Kindle Fire HD. This devices runs Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) by default.Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 - $199Pros - Performance Speed, GPS, Micro SD Card Slot, Google PlayCons - Screen Resolution 1024 x 600, No HDMI Out (they make a hdmi out adapter for the other galaxy tab/note models but not for the 7").Notes: Only 8GBs of internal storage like the Acer Iconia A110. This device runs Android OS 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) by default. For me not having HDMI out is the killer.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm writing this review on the Galaxy Tab 2.Cons:1. Samsung messed it up with "their" bluetooth stack! This device will not pair or stay paired with some bluetooth devices out there. It pairs fine with my media device to stream music, but it has issues with my OBD2 bluetooth adapter for my car.I bought this device mainly to dock it in my car to use with the Torque app (great app btw) via bluetooth to my car's OBD-II using BAFX Brand - ELM327 BLUETOOTH - OBDII OBD2 DIAGNOSTIC SCANNER - CAN ELM 327 SCANTOOL - CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAR CODE READER. I can pair using my phone or other non-Samsung device. When using this Tab it would not stay paired and would keep prompting me for the passcode. I enter the code and it pops up again (yes I am using the correct code)! I have to unpair, reboot, then pair again to get it to work. Imagine having to do this every time you get in your car!They should have left the bluetooth stack alone. I have heard that this is the case with most of their products. A workaround would be to root it and flash a custom ROM with a proper bluetooth stack but it's not our responsibility to fix Samsung's half-baked bluetooth stack! I have read that Samsung is aware of this issue and will release an update *some day*.2. Touchscreen does not respond well to LONG tap-and-holds. When tap-and-holding for long periods, it would become unresponsive and require you to retap-and-hold. Sometimes it doesn't respond on the first retap and you have to keep trying. It happens a lot when playing racing games where you want to tap-and-hold to accelerate. Out of nowhere it would lose track of my finger. Very annoying and my replacement unit has the same problem.3. Wi-Fi reception is weak! Don't expect to be able to connect to your router if it's on the other side of the house. Where I can get 1-2 bars of signal on may laptop, this Tab says the network is out of range.4. There is no way to remove the mini-apps (that arrow pointing up in the bottom-middle). The mini-apps are not that useful and it just takes up space. This should be optional.5. The camera is very poor, then again you can't expect much from one with less than 8MP these days.6. Charging is slow and requires Samsungs cable. Also, the supplied cable is too short. A standard USB plug would be ideal.Pros:-Good size where it's comfortable to type in portrait and landscape mode, and still fits in my pocket.-Not too heavy so I can hold it all day.-Somewhat quick and responsive CPU/GPU.-Decent screen (visible in direct sunlight).-Battery life decent with heavy use, power save mode on, and max brightness (a few more hours to get through the day would be nice).Not everybody will be using the Tab like me (pair with OBD2 bluetooth device or play racing games) so these issues may not be a problem. The Tab is still a great device and very robust. I would recommend it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|It is a great resource for accessing important information you need in your daily life at home and on the road. Lithium battery life last for hours, charges fast. I purchased the cheap Bluetooth leather/rubber keypad and it works great. I can read all my Emails, News, Weather, Research, and a lot more. The settings for the main controls are easy to access because of the info screen on the bottom right when you tap there it pops up. There is also a short cut screen if you touch the front center it pops up on the bottom of screen. Touch screen works very good, has many options that are customizable, and is nicely done. Many apps that are preinstalled I don't need, I have to find a way to get ride of them permanently, for now you can only delete the updates and the factory copy is reinstalled. Samsung has a full blown keyboard docking station that you can purchase for $79.There is a lot of junk you can install from the WEB, be careful, install AVG FREE Antivirus. Watch what apps you download so they don't rob your CPU power. A lot of the apps track you, in some you can turn options off in the program settings to save power or manually turn off WiFi and GPS and turn them on as needed.*** Important ***1) There is 8gb of internal storage (depending on the model you have), but they install the operating system on it which takes up almost half of it leaving you with 4.59gb left. You can put a lot of stuff in there even with only the standard memory! You can also install up to 32gb of external flash memory but be careful and take your time, it is tricky to put that little thin sucker into the side slot without dropping it and until it clicks. Kind of a balancing act on one finger then push it in with your thumb nail.2) There is no paperback user manual, you need to download .PDF file from their website. The paper manual costs over $20.00!! Call Samsung and gripe, maybe we all can get them to send us all one for free!All in all a very nice unit, buy one now if you can wait while they are on back order."This is not a toy" for children. READ THE HUGE SAFETY BOOKLET THAT COMES WITH UNIT or manual pages 206 and 207.*** Update ***It is amazing all the features this has, the apps are endless. I just did my online banking and deposited my check from home, I used the banks app and tried the mobile deposit and it worked!!You can search your TV listings, weather, read the Bible, find POI with the GPS, Skype video calls, make free land line calls with GrooveIP or Gmail. I can read all my local online newspapers for free. I found a police scanner and a Electrical Circuit app too.The world is at your finger tips and it is very addicting to say the least!! Dang, it even controls my TV and it is not a smart TV!! As long as it doesn't control me I will be OK, 8~)

tablet_galaxy_tab|So Samsung started bundling this with a keyboard, but if you bought the tablet beforehand, you might be seeking that same keyboard. Good luck finding it. Even the Samsung site doesnt have it. And if you dont pay attention to the fine print or the reviews, you'll end up buying a Samsung Galaxy dock which only fits the previous version. They found it necessary to change the size of the footprint just slightly to require a completely different keyboard mount than earlier versions. Ipod it is NOT. So beware of any peripherals that are not specific to the Galaxy Tab 2 7-inch. Specifically related to the dock or keyboard. Otherwise, it works fine with the android system and has expandable storage. The model intro leaves much room for improvement. Perhaps thats why the bundle came out....
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I couldn't decide between this and the Nexus 7. I'm glad I went with the tab! It is a perfect size, very light and works extremely well.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i bought this tablet after doing a lot of reading others' reviews. it was a toss-up between this and the nexus 7. it's the second tablet i've bought in two months and it's in a whole other league. the battery life is excellent compared to the other tablet. the wifi works great, and haven't had any problems with video or sound quality. it's light, portable and fast.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|todo de acuerdo a las especificaciones, excelente pruducto y el tiempo de entrega, fue tal y como lo indicaron desde el incio de la compra
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Well I received my samsung tab 2 right on time. Opened the package and it prompted to connect to my home wifi. Very easy to use. Its like A large smart phone without the data fees. I really wanted a ipad but could not afford it. Now that I have the tab 2 I really dont need it. Lots of apps app store Netflix, internet browsing. In fact i'm writing this review on it. I made a excellent choose. So should you. Smiles

tablet_galaxy_tab|my grandson just love the galaxy, It is his companison when to go bed, when he wake up on weekends.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Samsung is a technology mogul - love it or not. They are that good at making quality products that have great function.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Would recommend to anyone, especially the young ones.Samsung just updated the OS and looks even better now.Despite daily usage, battery is holding.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I own an original Galaxy Tab 7" wifi and the new Galaxy Tab 2 7" wifi, and honestly, I have to say the old one is better in almost every respect.Pros:*The GTab 2 is lighter, faster, thinner, and has slightly louder speakers.*Runs Android 4.0 and the screen is very pretty.*Has all the features you'd expect... with one glaring exception (See below).*Since it has a newer version of Android, it works with Bluetooth keyboards and HID devices.Cons:*The camera is horrible compared to the old one. It doesn't auto-focus, has no flash, has worse resolution, and you can't use it to scan barcodes (which I did a lot with my old GTab). I loved using the flash LED as a flashlight, too... works so much better than using the whole screen. I wish they would have left the camera alone, I would have paid the money for it.*The WiFi antenna is situated so that if you hold it upright with your left hand, WiFi reception is almost nothing. Hold it with the other hand (on the other side), it works perfectly. Why is it like this? The old GTab never did this.*When connected to a non-Windows computer, it won't let you connect as USB storage. Very frustrating, I can't just plug it in and copy files to it like my old one.*The auto-dim screen feature seems to always make it darker than it needs to be. I'm always finding myself turning auto-dim off because I just can't read the screen. Old one wasn't like this.My opinion:If I had known the camera was so bad on this, I wouldn't have bought it, even at the low price I got it for. I used the camera for close-up photos, some low-light shots, and scanning barcodes... none of which the GTab 2 can do. In every other respect it works great- good performance, etc- but I'm really second-guessing my decision to buy it based on the camera. I was hoping it would be a great replacement for my old GTab workhorse, but it falls short. I will probably give it to my daughter and reclaim my old GTab.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have had this for about 6 months and it is awesome. It is very durable(dropped it hit a metal trash can then the ground with no cover on it and not one single crack!) It is still working as smoothly as when I bought it. Overall awesome tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet does everything I wanted it to do and more. Had another brand (Viewsonic Viewpad) for a year but ran out of storage space so had to delete some of my apps. I've had this one for about 6 months now and holds tons of apps and is not even close to using all the space. Also much quicker than my old one and supports Adobe Flash Player (which the Viewpad did not). Also the price was less for this one. Can't think of anything I would need that this tablet does not have. Plan to keep this one for a long time. I love the 7&#34; size since I take it everywhere I go....it fits in my purse. I use the google calendar and it automatically syncs with my computer so my schedule is always up to date.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Nice product , easy to use and carry around. You may want to opt for one that can actually use a data service but if you don't mind the WiFi, this is ideal.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i bought it for the wifi network... simple checking of email without carrying around my laptop. it works fine for that. web browsing can be clunky but i still work with it when necessary. many apps available. have had trouble with the micro SD card not allowing me to write to it from my laptop after being in the tablet... and i haven't bee able to get the USB hookup to allow me to move data back-forth tablet to laptop. i also use it to review some of my film work with potential clients and the screen looks fine for compressed mpegs. for under $200 its a fine entry level tab for me-just wished some of the external card issues could be resolved.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|We gave our daughter this unit for Christmas and I really, REALLY wanted to keep it for myself! It is a perfect size and weight. Not too bulky. Gorgeous screen. What's not to love???
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great tablet. I would buy this again. I did review on several different tablets, liked this one the best. So far it has lived up to my expectations.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great device i got it for my wife she loves it. She studies and reads alot she does her banking. I ended up getting the 4g model for myself.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Just got it &#34;fired up&#34; with son's help as I'm &#34;electronically challenged&#34;. He loaded a book and my E-mails on it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Tried to get this at several stores on Black Friday with no success. Ordered this for my daughter for Christmas from Amazon that night, they were out of stock but was able to secure the sale price at that time of $179.99, it came in 2 weeks later. All other stores at the time were $249.99. She loves it. Easy to carry around, fast down loads. Very happy.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was skeptical of this purchase because of pass tablet buys. However after researching and believing in the Samsung name, I got it for my wife. I liked it from the start and as of this date, my wife still loves it, especially the cameras. I like it so much, I purchased two more for my parents. I wasn't looking for it to match my Ipad 2, but it does more than I expected it to and is well worth the money spent.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Tablets look great, and will make my boys very happy. Both tablets were shipped together and packaged with care. Thanks so much and Merry Christmas!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It came in good condition . Had only one issues wish was easily solve , i could not watch certain videos online ex espn. Obviously it doesnt come with flash for the camera annd doesnt sport 16gb internally . This is my first tablet gott it at a decent deal and it does everything well . I bought a keypad also whichh makes the experience even better. I love the screen , its performance an music quality is superior to others out there at its size . I highly recommend if u need a not so expensive but good qualiity tab.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this IPAD for my granddaughter and my 42 year old son set it up for me prior to Christmas. He even loved it.Then my grandson, 20 years old, liked it so much, he went out and bought himself the larger one. It is a big hit!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|In short: bought one for my mother-in-law, and one for myself.I am using my iPad less and less..Cheers,
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|So far the Samsung Tablet is doing great, slim, and the ICS OP loads fast. Great for travelling, at home to share videos and webs to the family
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have a samsung not even the brand new one that came out recently and i love it you can skype rear and front camera great for surfing net small enough to carry around but nice big screen.I have had it for about two months and use it alot more then I thought I would. Pretty good battery time
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I recieved mine last week & I just love it.This is my first tablet & I did alot of research before I choose one & I believe the Galaxy beat them all.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought my Tablet almost 2 months ago. I wanted it for a trip I'll be taking in a month with my children. I need them to be entertained. I've used it daily and so have my children. We LOVE IT! The battery life is great. We haven't had any issues or found anything we didn't like.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was a Mother's Day gift for my wife. She LOVES it!!! Love the Galaxy products. You won't be disappointed.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|What a great little machine, easy to operate, affordable and does everything our 10 year granddaughter needed it to do. Good purchase!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is exactly what I thought it would be...convenient, affordable and just awesome!! The size is just right because it fits right in my purse, the resolution is beautiful and the price is just unbeatable. 5 thumbs up!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love this Tab. It has all the features I required and then some. Also, it fits in my purse.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|About a month ago I got this tablet for my birthday. I am very grateful to my wife and kids for this device. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is a media device that comparable to the Kindle Fire in size and price. It has bluetooth, GPS, front and rear facing cameras, a micro sd card slot, and the Google Play store, the Kindle Fire has none of these.It is a wifi only device. I like that because there is no monthly fee for a data plan. This device can function well offline. I have used it for offline GPS navigation, played games, read books, listened to music and podcasts that were previously downloaded onto an sd card. The battery life is very good and can be tweaked to be great. I love this device.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great product, I bought it to use for email, occasional web surfing and reading books. All of the things I wanted I got and I have even been doing some other things with apps that I didn't expect to do.The Smart Remote app is one thing I thought I would use, but it doesn't work well with my Samsung HDTV. So I haven't used it. ??
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm actually typing this review from this tablet! Everything about it is pretty nice except for the camera. The pictures I took of the house looked quite washed out and out of focus. But if you aren't planning on taking pictures with it then it is an awesome little tablet!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This product is very good. It is easy to use and light. Sometimes it takes a few seconds processing information, but for those who want a tablet for reading, internet and simple apps, this device is almost perfect.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Simply wonderfull i love it! lots of apps for fun and play videos everywhere! both cams take pretty good photos, its slim fast and 32gb memory its a plus.I don't care if this is a Ipad copy like apple says, it's a lot better! than Apple Ipad 2If you want this, buy it , you never regret ! XD
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this from Amazon about three weeks ago and so far I think it's a great product. I am familiar with the Android OS since I have used it for about two years now. I'm impressed with 4.0 and it's speed and ease of use. Samsung has done a great job with this tablet making it very intuitive and functional. I am using it for business as well as personal. It is working well for all my Microsoft Office functions I need to use it for. Still getting used to there Polaris office program. Battery seems fairly long lasting and it syncs well with all my laptop programs I work with. Great tablet. I would definitely recommend this product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I already have an Ipad, and an Acer 10 inch tablet, but i wanted something that would fit in a cargo pocket, or be easier to hold in bed.... so after a little shopping I got this Samsung. I have to admit, my choice was really based on price more than anything, but I must admit this little thing is a gem. I've found the processor snappy, and I've not had issues with lag or lockup. The bloatware isn't as bad as some I've seen, and some of the programs are actually quite handy. Heck, the remote control for my tv would have probably convinced me to buy it based on that alone if I'd known about it before.... for those that haven't seen it, picture a universal remote that allows you to search for content and manage your dvr. The camera isn't the greatest, as noted, but I doubt i'll ever use it. Display is perfectly adequate, 32gb micro sd ensures i'll probably never run out of storage. It lacks a usb, but I'm ok with that mostly. All in all, I love it. I'd buy it again.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The only thing I dislike is realize this product was 30 Dlls chiper at SAMS Club. This tablet is fantastic for keep the connectivity, the battery delivers almost 8 hours with heavy use.Pretty good design. A nice option to carry in your backpack. The SGT2 7.0 has a lot of potential.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The tablet is great. It is cheap and works as expected. I am actually writing this review with it.The only bad thing is the cameras resolution is only 3.0 MP, but is isnt a problem to me, because i just use it for games, movies and music (GTA 3 works quite smooth).
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Blown away by the simplicity of this tab but yet so powerfully enjoyable! I havent even felt the urge to root and flash a custom rom on it yet xD
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I received the product a fex weeks ago, it was a gift for my wife because she was considering buying a tablet for her, but she knew little about which one to buy. After reading some good coments on amazon and on other web sites I decided to order one for her as a surprise. The little thing is great, incredible fast, easy to use, very light and handy. She carries it in her purse and no one can even tell she has one. She loves it, use it mainly as an e-book reader and to check e-mails, and is learning how to use it as an extension of her mini-pc. Very good product. Recomended.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I spent a month trying to decide which tablet device I wanted. I immediately ruled out the Kindle Fire as I hated the idea of being tied into the Amazon ecosystem. Ultimately the choice came down to either this or the new Google Nexus 7. The Galaxy Tab 2 won as it has an SD card slot and the nexus doesn't. After looking around I noticed it really didn't matter where you bought one from as they are the same price everywhere, so I went to my local office depot and made my purchase. I couldn't be happier with the choice.I bought my husband a kindle touch last year, and I loved the idea of having a collection of books at my fingertips. But being a geek I wanted something that did a bit more. I have always hated being tied to my desktop for things like checking email, reading the news or just general browsing. I also disliked having to run to my pc every time I wanted to look something up. Having the tablet eliminates those things for me. Also I wanted more room than what my smart phone gave me for games and apps such as the XBMC and roku remote apps.I can easily connect my tablet to my phones hotspot without any issue.I was able to set my tablet up as a phone using google voice & the GrooVe IP app (if you install this app make sure it's the one from Google play it's updated more frequently). This can also be accomplished using Skype if you have a subscription. So I can both make & receive phone calls as well as text (no media text though).I'm very happy with my purchase and I'm glad I made it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a really great product very easy to use and a lot of fun. Highly recommend. This is my first tablet so I didn't know what to expect and I'm pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and how quickly you can learn to use it.Thanks Amazon for your great service and Samsung for this wonderful product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It is an excellent tablet, i was going to get the kindle fire for its price, but this tablet gets the prize, the new operating system ICS 4, is perfect and runs smoothly !
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my first tablet. I am an Engineer and wanted to use it for robotic applications. With Android 4.0 I am able to use the Android ADK kit to talk to devices like the Arduino through USB. All of this worked correctly on the Galaxy Tab 2 during my testing. $250 for this device is a steal!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|A great product so far. Compliments my iPhone and my apps addiction nicely. The wifi is decent, despite what a few reviews here say. The build quality feels good in your hand. Screen is a bit prone to smudging and fingerprints so far, but thats not completely abnormal.Something that I dislike and to consider for your purchase though is how the SD card is used. The tablet does not appear to let me write anything to the SD card, which is a problem considering how much on board memory it ships with. I'm not sure if its a planned update, but considering that the SD card was one of the selling features to me its a disappointment. If it worked as many smartphones do, then it would easily be a five star product to me considering its cost alone.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The ipad 2 is not the size I want it, it is too big and hard to carry. I like to watch movie while i go to sleep. I ordered the samsung tab 2 7, right size, right price, good quality and android ics. I saw the display at best bye and looks very nice, but as most people do, tried at best bye and buy from someone else.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I had to return my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 again to BB as it wasnt too much of an improvement over my Kindle Fire. First one crashed several times a day. I loved it's size and finish but, it's browsing speed was slower, reading function poor, crashed at least four times a day, and battery life weak (3 hours vs. Kindle Fire's 12 hours). So disappointing for $250. Like one poster here, I found out from the BB people that there is a quad core tablet (powered by Nvidia Kai Tegra 3 Soc) that will be coming out in the next few months which wil be a Google-Asus joint venture. And yes, it is said that the new quad core will cost a measly $200.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Let me preface by saying that I originally purchased this tablet for my kids because they kept bogarding my iPad 2. As it turns out, the device really grew on me, especially the IR capabilities which allow me to control my extensive home theater devices. In addition, my job involves quite a bit of travel and the Samsung is a great device for traveling since it's smaller than the iPad.It has a fantastic display and Android allows you the ability to customize it with active themes and personalized widgets. The device is easier to handle than the iPad, and in landscape mode the navigation buttons are easily reached with your thumbs.The only real negative are the apps. There's no question that Apple has a better selection of Apps, especially for kids. You would think developers would actually devote more effort to the Android OS since there are more devices running Android than IOS. I think once Android catches up from a development perspective, Apple is going to have real trouble. The Galaxy S3 phone for example is light years ahead of the 4S and will still be a better device than the iPhone 5.The other negative as others have noted is that the battery life isn't as great as the iPad. Overall, I've very pleased with the Galaxy Tab 7.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Overall this is a good tablet for $250. The processor is fast enough, 1GB of ram is just right. Everything seems responsive. I got one issue and it is very important to me. I use the barcode apps a lot and I am having problem using barcode app with this rear facing (3.0 Megapixel) camera. The barcode is always out of focus when I try to scan the it. I think the camera is fixed focus one (I was excepted it to be auto focus). Maybe there is a setting that will turn on auto focus...like the camera from my phone. It actually has a setting to turn on auto focus. But I am not able to find in for Galaxy Tab 2. Maybe I just got a defective one. If anyone know how to turn auto focus on, please reply and let me know.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love Samsung, most of the time. But why upgrade a product not put put a flash on the camera? I sold this after a week of use and bought the older 8.9 inch version with a flash.The rest of it was great, but I couldn't' make it work for me. I'm currently renovating my home and use my tab to take pictures and write notes on the photos with the screen shot thingie and really needed a camera with a flash.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was looking for something convenient to do skype with the family. We have an iPad (ver 2), iPod, and an IPhone. I used to have an older flavor or android on an older sprint phone, but at that time, Android wasn't really ready for prime time. This system fits the bill, but...I can say the screen is not as responsive as the iPad's. The skype app - not sure if it is the app, or the device - but the cameras don't always work, and I have to rotate from landscape, to portrait, to landscape again for it to work. and sometimes the audio doesn't work. i've loaded and uninstalled and loaded it back a few times. Doesn't seem to make a difference. Also, I'm not sure the widgets area at all useful. I find myself going to the app-view to really find stuff. Also...Samsung loads A LOT of bloat-ware ...which I can't uninstall and will never use. The other rub about this is you can add a 16GB microSD card, but you can't store apps on it, so there is only a finite number of apps you can actually load on 8GB. But it answers my need for a quick/easy travel system since my company phone won't allow me to download skype on it :)
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Let me just say this, I have tried the best 3 the 7.0 tabs you can get at first I bought a Kindle Fire from here at Amazon in December of last yr and I don't really like it that well because I couldn't customize it or use the Google play store, it was defected when they shipped it to me, so I had to call customer service all day to get my refund back for it.Then in January of this yr I bought a Nexus 7 tab 32 GB from this website call Jr.com I payed with it with my Amazon payments account, it took almost a week and a half to ship to me. It was suppose to be brand new w/original packaging which it was, and no one used it before. I thought I was getting the best and coolest tab their was out but boy I was wrong. When I un-boxed the tab and turned it on the touchscreen was so unresponsive I couldn't even do anything on it, and it didn't even charge up. To make a long story short it, I called them and asked for a refund which I finally received yesterday. I warn you DO NOT BUY ELECTRONICS AT JR.COM, especially outta state and they have to ship it to you.And last and finally I bought this little gadget here the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and what can I say it is everything that the describing says and more, very fast, easy to use, works awesome with my WiFi connection. After searching and looking for other tabs I have finally found one that I'm very pleased with, and if anything happens to this tab I will buy another from here Amazon of course.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love it ...I take it everywhere I go. I knew I would love it. I thouht the seven inch screen would be to small but its perfect for my small hands...my only issues is if your not in a wifi area you get no signal.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|(I've also put this review under the Kindle Fire HD) I'm not one to typically write reviews but since I spent a long time researching the right tablet for our family I thought I'd give my opinion. First, the main use for our tablet was for the kids to play apps (fun and educational) and watch movies/shows. I wanted to be able to download movies/shows so they could watch them on the plane or if we didn't have wifi access I also plan to use it for books for them and me. I have other Apple products but didn't want to spend the money on something that the kids would primarily be using. With that said I narrowed my purchase down to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and the Kindle Fire HD. I actually bought both and tried both for a few days. I read many reviews and most said to go with the Galaxy. BUT, in the end I liked the Kindle Fire HD much better and here were my reasons:1. I thought the screen quality was better on the Kindle Fire HD (it is amazing!!!).2. The screen size was a little wider.3. The interface was much more user friendly with the Kindle.4. I'm a big Amazon Shopper and it just made more sense to go with the Kindle plus I plan to keep the Prime Membership up after the trial. Like that you can borrow a book a month, get free streaming of tons of shows and movies, free 2 day shipping), lots of free books.5. Supposedly there are many less Amazon apps than on Google Play but this has not been an issue with us at all. All the apps we want are available on the Amazon store.6. The big seller for me was the 16 gb internal memory versus 8 gb for the Galaxy. Also, in reality the Galaxy only has 4 gb internal memory because half it taken up already by the operating system and other stuff that is loaded that you can't delete. I do understand that there is the option to get an external SD card and in fact I have one but, FIRST, you can't store any apps on it only photos and movies, SECOND, it is a royal pain to transfer stuff to the extSD Card (you have to plug the tablet into the computer, transfer the files onto the computer and then put them back onto the tablet into the extSD card section. Weird!)7. So, even though the Kindle Fire HD with 16 gb is really only about 13 gb I like the fact that it has almost 3 times more internal memory8. The Kindle felt of high quality build.9. I have family members with the Kindle so we can share some books (not as many as we hoped but still a neat feature).10. Battery Life better with the Kindle Fire HD.11. Sound better too with Kindle.So, these are my 2 cents for what it's worth. I liked the Samsung Galaxy but I loved the Kindle Fire HD for what we wanted to use a tablet for. Happy shopping. I don't think you will be disappointed with either one!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this tablet in May of 2012 and have been generally satisfied with its' performance. I use it mostly for reading but have also found some of the applications useful for me. However, I found that Samsung Kies, which is Samsung's software for backup, synching, and downloading firmware updates, wouldn't often recognize the tablet and I've never been able to update the firmware via Kies even though an update was available. All updates so far have been done wirelessly through my home network. Online support for this tablet via email to Samsung is useless. I have not been able to successfully navigate or complete all of the required information using their support process to complete an email. That's been very frustrating! Samsung has been quite slow in upgrading from Ice Cream Sandwich to Jelly Bean and provides no schedule information whatsoever. Rumors have it happening soon but that's all they are; rumors. This tablet is okay for my basic needs but I wouldn't recommend it now given all of the other 7" tablets presently available. I'd definitely look for one that's well supported by the manufacturer.

tablet_galaxy_tab|For my daughter this size tablet was perfect.It works fine and does all I expected.Well constructed.I have not noticed any lock ups or times to need to reboot.Great if you use the amazon android store and get the free app each day. (a huge plus over apple software IMO)Android is open source which means a lot more programming for it and free apps.This cannot compete with an ipad but at this price it is the best you can buy IMO.I hear great things about the Kindle as well but for $50 more I wanted the full tablet capabilities which are not present on the Kindle.The browser is fast and the wifi connection is always solid.If you are looking for a device to read books, watch movies, listen to music, play games and create and store documents...etc than at this price it cannot be beat.There is a 10 inch version as well but obviously for more money.This size tablet is ideal for a kid especially as thier small less strong hands and wrists may have a hard time holding a 10 inch tablet up for any significant time period, unless they are always going to have it set down, then it doesn't matter, but on the go they will most likely be holding it in one hand.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This device is wonderful. Extremely fast and durable. I have dropped it several times and it still works properly. I hope this helps
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I had no problems setting this little device up, the OS very similiar to that of my Android phone. It is a little lighter than the Kindle Fire HD....and while it doesn't have the Dolby audio, I am sure I can live without that. It has a few very pleasant surprises that make it all very worthwhile to have as the Kindle Reader App.....and many more options in usability. I only gave it 4 stars because at this point I have only had it for a few hours.11/5/2012 Couldn't be happier with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0! Have read at least half a dozen ebooks on it since I got it, use it for documents in the kitchen when I am baking and cooking....just a best all around tablet. I did get the Poetic Slimbook Leather Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 Black and love that as well. It stands the tablet up for me in the work area and just really really happy I went with the Samsung rather than the Kindle Fire HD......so much more for your money!!!Poetic Slimbook Leather Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 Black(Included 2 Micro SD Card Slots) (Business Card Holder is Plus) (3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic)

tablet_galaxy_tab|Tried it for a few weeks now and I can tell you, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is really a GREAT adquisition. It is fast, the Android OS makes it easy to use, everything I've seen so far its been good. And that blabber about people not being able to use skype NOT TRUE. So if you're planning on buying something for Xmas, this would be a good choice.

tablet_galaxy_tab|For me, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 hits the sweet spot in devices. It gets high marks for price, performance, value, design and portability. While I don't use it for work, I do use it to watch netflix, read Kindle books, read epub books, shop on Amazon, search the web, type emails, video chat, google chat, control my tv, satellite receiver, samsung dvd player. In fact, I enjoy using it so much, I'm seriously considering dropping my mobile data plan on my smartphone and opting for voice and messaging only.My only complaint is not about the device, but rather about the eco system for non-ipad tablets. I pre ordered mine so I got the first case I could find. It's a great folio but it lacks a hole for the rear camera. Same thing with apps. There is one app on the iOS system that I can't a similar quality one on the android system.Love the product and if you're thinking about a tablet but are turned off by either the usability of other tablets or the price point, I definitely think you should look into the Samsung Galaxy tab 2 7.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was thinking about getting a Kindle Fire, but someone in Best Buy convinced me that for $50 more than the fire, you get the full google play store, better OS (Operating System) and overall better performance. I'm very glad I got this and not the fire. It's light and portable, goes on internet,facebook and things like that, and it has flash player so you can watch youtube videos and such. It runs games very well, I also ordered the Elsse (TM) Premium Case Cover with Stand for Samsung GALAXY Tab 2 7.0 - Black for it and it works nicely. It has and SD card slot so you get extra storage for a little extra cash. It is a great tablet and at such a low price, you can't beat it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I had high expectations for this product. Unfortunately, it didn't meet all of them. Not sure what they were thinking by placing the on/off button on the side next to the volume as opposed to putting it on top, I frequently turn it off by accident. Also, it's not that great when looking for wifi, my vizio tablet does a better job at it than my galaxy.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I just received my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and its more than words can express! The screen is bright and you can adjust the lighting if necessary. It has a mute option for the sound and the controls for every app is simple and seamless to catch on to. I think even a newbie to the tech world would get a kick out of this device.It was love at first sight with the browser connecting to download apps. I obtained an app and all my files from gmail account (which can be synched). And everything is just as nice as it was on my HTC G2 phone. Even apps that I forgot about .. .but that is ok lol.This device definitely tops off the list when it comes to my favorite device to use. I only had it for an hour and I am already taken aback by its swift change from activities I select for it to run. Even the camera (which is HD quality) takes super clear pics as if I was using my 14mp camera. I am not sure how the resolution correlates but if you ask me it is quite comparable.Needless to say, and I do mean to repeat it - get this device especially if you are a gamer. The quality is so superb you will say goodbye to your television gaming consoles and Hello Samsung Galaxy Tab 2!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I like this, except one thing. I don't value a high resolution camera, but I really value auto focus feature, which this device misses. It is very disappointing to me. So I would not use the camera function that much, and that seems okay because this tablet is anyway too big to be used as a cameraThings I really like are:- Battery life itself, and standby battery power use. For example. 76% remaining level becomes 75% or still 76% even after the video play is paused and left for 10 hours, (the screen is blanked automatically after around 1 min., if video play is paused) In my case, to minimize the standby power use, in the setup menu I turned off WIFI, Bluetooth and GPS, and (I think) I checked on the "Power save mode" in brightness control. This is just standby status. If you touch the screen, the screen right away turns on.- Brightness control:The screen can be really dark (unlike my galaxy-s smartphone), so your eyes are much comfortable when you see the screen in the dark.(My Galaxy-S smartphone cannot be that dark. The minimum level is still bright. Because of that, for my smartphone I use some darkening program to make it darker, but even that program cannot make the bottom button lamps that dark. That is very annoying to me). This Tablet is free from such problems.)- Internet browsing is much faster than my Galaxy S android phone. I think it is because of better CPU (dual core)- The other features are almost same as my Galaxy-S smart phone. So it supports all kinds of video format, 720P video support, All kinds of amazing concept apps in the Android Market.I am really really satisfied.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this as a replacement for my dying Viewsonic tablet. This puppy is terific! So much more versitile and compatible than the Viewsonic...

tablet_galaxy_tab|This would be a wonderful little tablet if only it worked - and I tried 2 of them with miserable results. I purchased the Student Offer (came with the keyboard dock for charging) from Costco and was a great buy. And, I loved it however, after 1 month it froze up and you could not even power it off. Returned it to Costco and they replaced it with another one. When I powered it up the screen was totally different than the first one. The on screen keyboard was much smaller then the orig. tablet had. I finally realized it was set up for a phone. After numerous, numerous updates the tablet had the screen and keyboard same as the first tablet. Still could not access some programs as it constantly said "there is a difference between the device and server of more than 2 hrs and 10 minutes." After trying to set the time with ALL the time zones listed and still not being able to come to the time the device wanted. E-mailed Samsung and chatted via computer with a representative who finally told me to return it to the store as it must be defective - now that was 2 of them. I gave up and returned the second one to Costco - thank goodness for their 90 return policy. I saved myself any more aggravation and purchased an I-Pad2 which has been a dream compared to the nonsense with the Galaxy. I really liked the 7" tablet and would have liked to have had it to enjoy, but enough was enough.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Great cheap device with some glaring problems.I have a Galaxy Nexus, iPad 2 & 3, iPhone for comparison. I've had the Tab 2 since the 25th (1 day after launch).Pros: Price, portability and form factor. Excellent video/music player.I got a OTG cable and plugged in 3 USB sticks and that was fun but impractical.Cons:Only works if you are tied to Google's eco-system.For example, mail & calendaring. Calendar does not support open-source caldav. No support for .ics calendars.Mail does not support PUSH IMAP email unless you use Gmail. Even then, it has problem with certain Cyrus/Postfix mail servers using TLS authentication.Sure there are apps on the PLay store but I found all of them to be flakey at best. VPN , like most Android devices, is flakey and unreliable.Bottom line. Don't even think about using this device for work. This is a toy so I wasn't so hung up on the lack of business features.However, there are some other bigger issues. I bought this tablet on the premise of expandibility. My 64GB iPad cost $829. I have about 6 32GB microSDHC class 10 cards.So I figure I can have an inexpensive video player that I can swap cards with and use as a GPS/entertainment system in the car.First of all. It has very poor file accessibility support. ICS drop USB Mass Storage so you have to use MTP which has problems.On Macs, you have a 4GB limitation with the Google MTP application. Not only that, it only works 2 out of 10 times. The Galaxy Nexus doesn't have this problem.There is virtually no or very flakey MTP support in Linux - CentOS/RedHat. Considering Androoid is based off linux, there should be better cohesion.I guess you can install the SDK kit and do adb pull and push in the command line to get your files onto this tablet but I dont think most readers here are commandline Linux gurus.Heck, even the iPad has drag-n-drop apps/files support in Linux. The micro-sd slot isn't going to help as I explain further..So getting large files to the device is going to be a problem.The Tab 2 is billed as 8GB but 1/2 of it is partition for the OS and the user is only left with 4 GB of free space.The microsd card isn't very useful for these reasons:You can only format FAT32. exFAT, NTFS, HFS does not work. I even tried formatting my cards EXT2, EXT3, EXT4 (Linux filesystem).Why is this an issue? Well, most HD movies are 5-6 gigabytes and FAT32 has a 4GB limit. So forget about copying your blu-ray rips.OK. strike. I guess playing my movie collection isn't going to work.Next, with only 4GB of user-accessible storage on the internal, apps will fill it up quick.I installed Navigon ( I wanted to use my tab as a GPS for the car), Google earth and a few apps and my Tab 2 was FULL.After a day's worth of emails, I had 48 megabytes free.ICS does not support apps2SD where you can move apps to the external SD card.And for apps that store their cache and support programs, the microSD slot is viewed as /extSD and not /mnt/sdcardI have hundreds of apps on my Galaxy Nexus as the OS sees 29GB and the apps can install and see the virtual internal sdcard. With the Galaxy Tab 2, there is no luck due to how ICS handles internal storage and external micro-sd.You can root your device but it is a known issue that apps2sd does not work for ICS. You cant "move" your apps to the external mounted microsd.Other issues: poor wifi. I have 4 phones and 2 tablets of various makes and the Galaxy Tab 2 has the poorest range. It also drops Wifi N connections.It doesnt support EAS-TL certificate wifi.Bluetooth issues galore. I have an Incredible, ATT Captivate, Galaxy Nexus and all of them can pair to a ELM32 ODBC module to use with Torque.The Galaxy Tab loses pair bluetooth keys. Older HDMI cables for the Galaxy Plus and 10" Tab does not work. I cannot get it to play video thru HDMI.Sure, the iPad has a close ecosystem but it simply works better. I can copy 6GB HD movies to my iPad. I can connect to various Linux servers's email and calendaring system.Heck, I can even mount and copy files from a Linux machine to my iPad. E.G. copy movies over.I am hoping a 7" model comes out soon because I like the form factor.So I guess I will be returning this tablet and expect something to address the issues with ICS and storage.a

tablet_galaxy_tab|I must say I liked the interface of ics one main problem it CANNOT MOVE PROGRAMS TO THE THE EXTERNAL SD CARD which means you are regulated to the primary cards memory in this case 8 gig. Yes I will go further to say some programs have problems reading off virtual sd so if you put music on or something which it should retrive automatically. Don't know why they did this but, I will not guess.The tab is also a problem unless wifi is constant connected. ICS is also more of a phone product without the uses you get with phone even those that require wifi and no phone. HoneyComb better for tablets..
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 has been working great and is fast enough for me. I would love to keep it, but unfortunately has one problem that is a deal-breaker. The WiFi connection works, but cannot stay connected for long. It keeps disconnecting and reconnecting even if I am near my router. My laptop, ipad 2, and even my Samsung Charge smartphone stays connected with no problems. Same router, same settings, and same distance. I tried resetting the router, resetting the Tab, turning off all other WiFi devices, but the problem still exists.Finally, I went to a local store to pick up a second unit as a comparison, in case my first unit is defective. However, the problem still occurs. I have a D-Link Wireless N router with WPA-2 security. It never had any issues with all my other devices. I also contacted Samsung support, but they weren't able to provide a working solution. With downloads and video chats being interrupted often, I will have to return this unless Samsung can release a patch soon.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I like it so far. It's fairly new for me but I'm enjoying it. Great games to download and awesome apps as well. Will recommend!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|For the price it is a very good product. However, the sensitivity of the screen is not on par with Apple products. I believe that this is more of an OS issue than a hardware problem. Often times if you use video streaming the system crashes and you have to restart the device to restore functionality. Sometimes it refuses to go to sleep.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Esta tableta es bastante buena y cubre las necesidades b&aacute;sicas que necesitaba cubrir en cuanto a navegaci&oacute;n y redes sociales!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am from Saint Vincent and I tried to download the words with friends app and it says &#34;Not available in that country.&#34; My other friends have the same Samsung galaxy 11 and from the same country and they are downloading. I will like to know what is wrong with the product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great Android product as expected. Good battery time, handy, easy to use, lot's of usable apps, etc.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very good Tablet,I found it in internet, before i find out about it and my friends advice me about it, Now I'm glad about my decision its right good
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this for my step-daughter! Much better than some off name tab. She loves it! Does everything she wanted it for.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I use this everyday for my business transaction its easy and to carry anywhere I go im never going to part with it no regrets
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I like this tablet a lot but it could use a few more options to be a great tablet. It needs USB and HDMI ports. The speakers are adequate but could use an upgrade too. The battery does seem to drain rather fast.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a well engineered, user friendly, rock solid, expandable and multi-purpose computer as well as a tablet for a great price. Performance is excellent to off-the-charts, screen is excellent (the screen might not be as good as those that are 2-3 times the price but it is darn close, your eyes may not even notice and if you don't want to pay more there is no need to.) It is outstanding for movies, high demand items, crystal clear, and plenty fast. No issues whatsoever. Perfect.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|After taking alot of time considering my options out there I chose this one. My main reasons being 1) expandable memory which I find very useful. I dont understand why the other competitors dont offer that. 2) Ease of use since my wife and I already have Samsung Galaxy S3's. This made the learning curve practically zilch. Very easy to hook up to my network fun to use. We got it for family use and my 7yo daughter loves it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very good tablet, I can see where it will be very useful. I give it a 5 star rating. Excellent
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It's like having a blown screen of the galaxy S3. Google play make it excellent for downloading applications. Will recommend to everyone.

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My took it from me and now it's her's. May I'll sneak a peek. Meanwhile I am enjoying my new tv.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was a gift for my husband in D.R. I had a friend take it to him so we can Skype. It has poor video quality. It's never clear , always appears dim , even when he goes by the light. I got my granddaughter a cheap table for half the price and the Video has better picture.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am using it now. I love my little tablet im debating on if I should get a larger one. I would like it if the video was in mp4 format where I can burn it right to a dvd after connecting it to my computer but I gott find some software to do that. Other that small dilemma I like this tablet a lot
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It's an okay tablet. I purchased this because my itouch's home button is broken and the screen is all cracked (I put a tape over the screen to keep it from going into pieces). As I am writing this review, I am still using my itouch since it loads faster and the keyboard/screen is easier to use and works faster than that of the galaxy tablet. I am not an apple fanatic or anything (I think this brand is a little bit overrated) but I still see myself reaching for the itouch than the tablet. Of course I am happy that I can finally read my ebooks since the tablet is more advance than my 2nd generation itouch. I know I am talking more about the bad stuff about this tablet (and I am going to do it some more) but this tablet is not bad for the price. One of the things that I don't like the most about this tablet is the screen, it rotates so slow and sometimes I have to click on somethings a few times for it to respond. And the keyboard response is also hard to maneuver and use, sometimes I will have to type a letter a few times before finally getting the right letter. I don't know if buying this tablet refurbished matters but it shut down 2 times on me now, and both times while I was on instagram. Also, I think it will be nice if this tablet has an extra home/power button. Since my itouch home bottom broke I've been using the power button to turn it on, so i think it is very useful if this tablet had a another button to turn it on as backup when the power button breaks or something. Okay/good tablet but I think I will buy myself a laptop or another itouch.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Nice tablet I like it and use it in my every day life, but the main problem for me is that it can not instal applications in memory card, and his own memory is not big enough.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|very nice tablet and the shipped are very very quickly thanks... for the people of Datavision i hope to buy any ohter pruduct with you
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I just got mine today. Been playing with it off and on since i took it out the box. Visually, the graphics on screen look pretty awesome. Video's play nice. It works just like my samsung mobile android device, but with a bigger screen of course... which is good for when you want to view movies and other nice videos. It's cool. I like it so far! :)I didn't want a tablet as big as the ipad, so i felt like this would do. ;)Yep! Good stuff!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I wanted to purchuse a tablet but not spend a lot of money. I got one for under $100 dollars ane quickly discovered, you get what you pay for. I found the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 with all of its features for a great price and figured I would see if it was any better. I have been blown away by how intuitive and responsive it is, The google based software synced my smartphone with the tablet which I wasn't expecting, but liked very much. All in all, this is a great tablet!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|WHEN I RECEIVED IT I SPENT ALL WEEKEND PLAYING WITH IT. NOW I AM LIKE A LITTLE KID WITH A NEW TOY. IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING GREAT
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Good for reading e-books, playing sudoku, playing solitaire, reading e-news etc. Battery life is a little short, about 6 - 8 hours before recharge. I bought another one for my grand daughter so we could Skype. I would recommend it for casual users but not for power users.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The tablet itself is a great tablet. Great applications and works flawlessly. However, the one we received from Amazon had a light spot on the screen when we received it that became bigger over the first week. We returned it and bought one directly from Samsung. Amazon was cooperative and accepted the return with no problems. I'm sure it was just a fluke.The product itself is outstanding.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I should have returned it while I still can.I planned to use it to access the view from a security camera but could not do it (while my brother's iPad can see the view, tilt and pan the camera just fine.)I've just download an android app (from Google store) to monitor my car (Nissan Leaf) remotely but I got the message that says "Your device isn't compatible with this version. I think the app is compatible with the Android version but the error message is misleading. The device here is probably referred to the car. The tablet could not access neither the car nor the internet camera.This tablet keep dimming and turning itself off in less than 20 second while I'm trying to copy the message from its screen (even it is plugged in. So annoying.)I should have returned it and buy an iPad
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Product description said it was Netflix compatable. Every time I tried to go to Netflix it said the operating system was too small. Size does make it harder to read. You can enlarge an area to read it. I bought it so I could sit on the porch and still browse. It works well for that but I wish I could pull up a Netflix movie as promissed.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It has a REALLY short battery life and is slow because the RAM is so small and fills up quickly.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The screen is too small for my taste. With in one week the device start not responding to the on and off button. Very frustrating. I send it back.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Mostly, I like the Galaxy tablet's features. The main reason I selected this tablet was for the IR blaster, but it doesn't recognize my Westinghouse TV. I almost sent it back because of this flaw.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I would recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab as an alternative to Apple. It is price reasonable and easy to operate. The only problem that I have with the shipper is the colour that was sent to me. I requested a black model and I received a gray one after opening the sealed package.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this for my mom form Christmas; she loves it! Perfect for all of her needs & so small she was excited to be able to get rid of her desktop computer.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Despite being a low-cost device compared to others in its class is an excellent price-value, it appreciates the brilliance of its display and the speed in performance, misses his metal body (like preview models) and the headphones that does not incorporated ...

tablet_galaxy_tab|I really love it!!I like this one a whole lot better!!I recommend this one if you want a tablet! !

tablet_galaxy_tab|Samsung super&oacute; mis expectativas por lejos. Excelente compatibilidad con otros dispositivos de la misma marca. Duraci&oacute;n extendida de la bater&iacute;a de gran utilidad.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|this thing is great i love it its just like my Samsung Galaxy S 3 phone you can link it up together and share files and music with out a problem at all its a little heavy but you get used to it now i have only had it for a day or so but so far so great can hold up to 32 or 64 gs of memory so i can load it with anything i want can u have the kindle book thing on it so u can read all the books u can buy and great screen for watching Netflix i just love it so for so great
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Took a little longer than expected, But provided me in a price where all the other providers were out of stock for the price offered. Overall, very much satisfied for providing it on a discounted price even after a week of sale. Thanks !
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought 2 of these and unboxed them 1/18/2013. Came off factory floor 12/1/2012 so says the Samsung website when I registered their serial numbers. Noticed right off they had Andoid's latest Jelly Bean OS 4.1.1 right out of box. Went to setup Peel app for the remote and found they would not work. Googling I found that others are having that problem with 4.1.1 if they try to setup new devices with it. I really love this tablet but I feel to be in a quandary over returning these as defective or hang on till the 4.1.2 push when the fix will be in. Anyone already get 4.1.2 on theirs yet? Will give 5 stars when they fix the IR Blaster.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Its fast and has awesome sound. It came just as described. Awesome gift for anyone. Thinking about buying a few more.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My 8 year old grandson was delighted, it met all his expectations for games, video and sharing with his friends.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The samsung tab is great ( I however don't like the Jelly Bean Upgrade from the ICS ) which has nothing to do with you. With this tablet you get alot of bang for your buck what's there not to like the only thing I regret is not going with the 10 inch one would have been easier on my eyes. Great product I highly recommend this product!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Personally i'd prefer to get the ten inch version for my self but then again this was a gift for someone and they loved it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|EXCELLENT FULL ME THE TABLE WAITING expectations that I did not realize all its access and what I can do with it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This was to be a Christmas gift, but this item not available, as i waited to long to order. But since my sisters birthday was a few days after Christmas this was perfect.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It must be because it's a refurb, but I've had my tablet for a week, and it was a headache within the first 12 hours. The App Talk has a slight delay that bothers me because if you take to long typing in a response you can accidentally hit the wrong autocorrect word. The yahoo email doesn't work as well as the google. maybe samsung has something against yahoo. But when I would send emails, though they would come up in the file Sent, they were never received. Thats annoying and a half. Also the Talk app can sync with friends and contacts on google+ but the Google+ app doesnt sync well with friends and contacts that have google+. Weird. And yeah, if you're a rightie, holding the tablet with your left hand does block the wifi reception. And yeah it doesnt always connect seamlessly to the wifi. And yeah the screen blacked out this morning, so I went to the Samsung website and did a troubleshoot of a Live Chat. I'm pretty sure the guy wasn't from the united states and it does take awhile for them to respond. But he showed me how to start up the device again by holding down the power key for 15-20 seconds. and I grilled him about it happening again and he told me the factory reseting is the only way to do it. Ugh, catch 22 anyone?
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Still two (2) tablets are in the own box I guess they must be very good. Nevertheless there is one (1) which I never received in spite that I have paid the all price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I received my galaxy with high hopes, but I am disappointed. My unit is refurbished, and apparently refurbishing does not include removing personal information from the previous owner, because I have all their contacts, and phone numbers. The unit has also frozen at least six times in as many hours. I've never had a bad experience with Samsung products, so I'm left wondering if it was the &#34;refurbishing&#34; process that may have caused the problems. Probably returning the unit and buying elsewhere since customer service exists solely in the form of returning and/or exhanging. Dialogues with CS are apparently not encouraged..
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|it overpass the expectations, im very happy with this purchase and i recommend it more than anything because of the relation cost-quality
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Tablet is great, but if you are a amazon prime member and want to watch a moive though amazon forget it.Want to watch a free tv show from network TV, forget it. You need Flash player which is not available for android 4.1 which I am sure Samsaug didn't want to include so you would be forced to buy or rent though them or Google.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a wonerful little tablet! It is quite useful! Charges quickly makes a great remote for my television. Glad to own this! I Reccomend it highly!

tablet_galaxy_tab|Received the tablet yesterday. Quickly charged the battery and set it up right away. Super easy, very cool! I love it

tablet_galaxy_tab|High Quality - sharp screen - I only wish the carmeras had zoom control. I sure recommend this item to people.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|she was so happy when she got this, she wanted something that she can walk around with but something that can replace her old laptop and seeing as how all really really uses a computer for is the internet, documents and movies in between she is loving this tablet.When she get it it immedatealy updated to ics and 2 weeks ago it updated to jelly bean. this tablet has become her new best friend she has completely for got her blackberry and how to use it because she loves how is it is to learn and user her tablet and is enjoying all the feature richness of android

tablet_galaxy_tab|I like this tab. Its small and handy. performance is also pretty good. It has almost all the feature of my cell galaxy sIII.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Simple and easy. Love the size and performance, good price, you don't need to expense more money, this tablet really work for me.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this with the intentions of being able to maybe,once in a while,'please just for a few minutes' use it. NO the wife keeps it under her lock and key. So as far as i can tell it has been great!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Unfortunately had to return this, but only because it was 7 inches and not 10. I should have played closer attention to the description! Great quality product though!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|its samll enough to take every where with out it being a huge hassel. i love the way it performs it was beyond my expectations.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Well for my first tablet I gotta say I made a great choice. It's super easy to carry, light, love the camera, sound quality exceptional, great reader tab, downloads stuff like movies super fast, I can decide to download a movie now using the utorrent app and watch the movie within 20 minutes. I love the vast amounts of app. I just love tab.ConsThe reason why I never gave it 5 stars is because it has frozen on me twice, a little concerned about that and battery life not great.But its still a great tablet, its now my life I do everything on it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|muy buen producto llego perfectamente y muy rapido . . todo bien recomendado excelente producto y vendedor un placer comprar
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Adequate features, very user friendly i recently bought this product. it takes beautiful pictures and the features are magnificent, better than any cannon camera.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It's not dual-band and after using the item for a few months, the screen is not very sensitive to the touch. Even trying to get the virtual keyboard or to get the icons, I have to swipe my finger multiple times before it is registered.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am not sure if this product is as this people say it is, I hope they send the same one that they have on their website with the Smart Remote app and built-in IR Blaster, so you can watch and control your TV content, because I could not contact amazon LLC they do not have contact cell option, so be careful. or cancel the order.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I previously owned the first nook from b&n a few years ago and wasn't satisfied with its limitations. This time around I wanted something more. Enter the Samsung Galaxy tab 2. It feels fine to hold and the camera is weak but at least it has one. It was easy to set up and navigate. Easy to personalize too. The downfall came when I was using the web browser or doing anything with the keyboard. Several pages wouldn't load and the keyboard isn't as reactive as I'm used to. There was a definite delay. I am taking it back today, for the money I'd rather wait and save longer for something better.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great tablet for my son. he got this for this birthday. He loves it, able to play all his games, a lot of great applications to chose from and so much easier for him to carry around versus a laptop. He played with my iPad before I got him this - and because he was already familiar with the android platform - he hated the ipad and love the Galaxy. It is really a great buy and for the price - really love it. It is a little small for me though.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|After charging and starting it I realized all of my cell phone contacts were entered without me downloading them. It was done automatic. I'm now afraid to take it most places because it may get stolen and a lot of private info is on it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I use visual patterns on my keyboard to randomize most of my passwords for security reasons but easy to remember because of the pattern. For example up, up, &#60;shift&#62;up, right, right, down on the keyboard starting where ever you like. I also use the &#60;shift&#62; number keys such as %#& in my passwords.The key above F is R and above that, the 4 key on a standard keyboard but on the Galaxy touch keyboard the 3 key is above R. The number row is shifted too far right.Additionally, the apostrophe is not on the default view and requires a shift key to a symbol layout. I use a lot of contracted words like: I'm, shouldn't, don't, etc. so this is all very annoying.I also found lots of websites on my (Google Chrome) browser did not display well, or had a custom android app that didn't work well (Facebook). While entering text into website comment windows, navigating my text for editing is horrible; no arrow keys or End key on the touch keyboard.I'm playing with the remote control app for my TV, etc. but it's buggy. The facial recognition log in doesn't recognize me most of the time, luckily it has a 4 digit pin for backup. It comes with Polaris Office app that has text, spreadsheet, and slides. I have yet to test worksheets but it does recognize Microsoft .xls files 2000/XP/2003 compatible.PLUSES: I find it great for sharing photos with the 32gb micro card accessory installed. It's a large screen with great resolution and plenty of brightness, although keep it down to get the 4+ hours of battery time. Using the two finger squeeze motion makes zooming in and out very easy. The one finger flicking to move around pages includes acceleration with faster flicks and stops on a dime with a touch. Streaming video content such as Netflix is actually quite comfortable solo and the speakers sound surprisingly good. Download speed is just as fast as my desktop so streaming a movie is great.It doesn't have a phone built it but there's no monthly cost. WiFi access is easy to find and setup. It also has built it GPS that shows my location when on the road. I haven't been able to get voice directions yet. Maybe it needs WiFi? My Desktop Windows 7 system is still the best with the 24&#34; LCD for real document editing or gaming but I prefer the Galaxy Tab 2 7&#34; screen over my laptop.The processor speed reminds me of dial-up but it's tolerable. As my very first tablet ever, and as a very first time Android OS user (not a smartphone user), I am quite pleased with the device overall. Getting into the operating system will take me awhile but fun to explore.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Todo bien y perfecto con el vendedor... ;) Lo recomiendo 100 %, todo llego en perfectas condiciones seg&uacute;n lo prometido.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I went back and forth between giving this 3 or 4 stars. It's hard for me to judge it fairly because I'm an Apple product user and this is SO different. I like that it's small and easily taken anywhere, but it is taking me a LONG time getting used to it. Got it on Cyber Monday sale so I'm glad I didn't pay full price.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i love love LOVE this tablet, its perfect for me. its much smaller than all other tablets, but it just makes a perfect fit for your hand. So cute!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Slide shows run backwards. Doesn't connect with AllShare properly.No wired connection to a TV.Samsung calculators do not include the inverse trig functions. This is true of their phones also. Makes their calculators a joke.Samsung support is worthless. Otherwise pretty nice (unfortunately thoseare the features I bought it for).
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|im love apple , i have iphone 4 , but , really this tablet 7&#34; with android 4.0.4 its dream come true , amazing easy to used , the battery time its pretty good 7 hours , bluetooth, wifi , etc , all recomended 100% its true
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My sister got it and she loved it you souls buy it too you will love it also get it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Pretty much everything was there had no issues and it worked right out of the box a tiny scratch on the side but it's still nice.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought it for my husband, who is not really techy, but loves this product. Great size, great clarity, and great price!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Is great design, function is very fast, application Photos and videos is good. The connection Wireless is faster of the world
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love Android, so this was a very easy item to master. Perfect size for her - she is 9 years old and just wants to watch movies and play games on it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this instead of ipad at advice of grandson. Wish it had come with the complete book of instructions- to download them at some 160 pgs, takes a lot of paper and ink. Think I'll like it when I figure out all it will do. Bought it so wouldn't have to take my large laptop when I travel.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Excellent product. Sent on time. I am satisfied with the care provided. RELIABLE, RESPONSIBLE, AND A TIME. I recommend it 100%
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My wife's xmas present, she loves it. You can do everything you can do on your Samsung Galaxy SIII phone and more. BUY A CASE AND SCREEN PROTECTOR FIRST THING!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The first few weeks I was quite impressed by this tablet, but as the days went by and often having to update all the apps it started to frustrate me more and more. Now with a major OS update the unit is just plain a pain in the ass to use! It often freezes up and all my previous apps have mysteriously disappeared, so i had to reload them back. The main reason I purchased this was the expandability option using a micro sd card. This in itself is a pain to use because it takes quite a while to read the card. The list of negatives can go on and on: wi-fi is terrible (and i have a new router and fast internet) the battery time is poor-can only watch two 90 minute movies before it's drained. The keyboard is slow and frustrating to use and I'm not impressed by the screen resolution. Why did I buy this, because of the glowing reviews here on Amazon. Guess it's going on craigslist.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|recomendado para la compra buen producto y barato vale la pena recomendado para la compra buen producto y barato gracias
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great device. Can't use Adobe Flash Player on it anymore. Makes watching some movies and videos impossible. I would return it, but it's past the 30 day return period.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Exactly what I was looking for this will be my last review, because I don't need to write a book!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|my previous tablet (Dell Streak 7) was stolen and i was in tablet withdrawal 2 months! this is the tablet i wanted and could not afford 2 years ago, but with a reduced price, I ordered and received it. i prefer the smaller 7&#34; size for reading since it can be held in one hand. am still getting used to the apps, but overall it is EXACTLY what i wanted and expected with one exception ~ the Dell had a 8x zoom cpability, and the Galaxy only 4x. That said, I am very happy camper 8~))

tablet_galaxy_tab|I like the tablet it works ok, But what I don't like is that It won't let me print to my wireless printer. It says I have to print to a Samsung Printer. If I would have known that I might have gotton something else. I would like to know if there is a way to print to a wireless network.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Its been over a week i got it and felt good so far. I would recommend to buy this.I won't give five at this point as its just a week old now.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I chose this rating as it was okay for the price that I got it for. Lots of things to discuss. One is that it lacks the &#34;flash&#34; on the camera, though the camera itself is amazing. Secondly, the storage on the device is very good. Most apps run, yet some such as &#34;WHATSAPP&#34; do not run. Internet is very fast, Chrome, obviously is the best browser to use. Additionally, the tab, even though it is 7 - inch, really fits my standards. The case that we got was from Poetic and really covers the tab well.Overall, the Tab is very nicely made, lightweight and fast, and I would reccomend this to potential buyers.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|When it comes to cheap Android tablets you can do better ( Nexus 7). The build quality of the device overall is nice, but just could not get past the lag of the software. I have a Galaxy S3 and it has been a great phone, but it has the power to to handle Samsungs overlay Touch Wiz, but this tablet does not. I bought the tablet because it was a good price and thought I could deal with it, but it was not an enjoyable experience dealing with the software. Stick with Nexus 7 or iPad mini, if looking for a 7 inch form factor.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I liked it for the price i paid ($180). Still exploring the features in it but so far no complaints.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Like the Nexus 7, this seems to have me a bit undecided on whether this or the Nexus 7 makes the best 7 inch tablet for Android. This falls behind the Nexus in specs, but makes up for it in other features like TouchWiz, the IR remote, and expandable memory. The one major drawback for me is that this particular model is limted to the 8gb memory capacity (with the exception of the student addition which I can't find anywhere anymore, but even that's limited at 16 gb). Something like this, I feel, should be at a minimum of 16 gb with an option for 32 gb. If it was a 32gb one, I'd choose this one in a heartbeat over the Nexus 7, but because it's lacking that memory, it's a toss up between this and the Nexus 7.To give a little bit more background information:I started off with a Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet and loved it so much that I wanted another Samsung tablet that was smaller in size for portability. I figured that besides specs, the only way the Tab 2 would fall behind its big brother the Note 10.1 would be that it lacks the S-Pen. So I bought it (sadly, I paid like $200 or $250 and a month or so later, I saw the price for this model drop to about $149). When I got the device, I saw that it performed much slower than the Note 10.1, which was expected. However, it was still a sweet device with the ability to use front and rear cameras, edit documents, enjoy the Android app store (Google Play), and so forth.But with my usage (pictures, movies, video games, apps), it filled up too fast. Of the 8gb, I think you only get to use 5 or 4 and a half, so you're pretty much restricted to space. If you're using it just for things like email, streaming video (YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, etc.), and for surfing the web with the occasional app or game download, then this should be perfect. But if you're going to use it for all those functions in addition to things like downloading games (esp. the high memory games), apps, and so forth, then you might want to look elsewhere for a device with more memory.While you can use the micro SD card with this device, it does not allow you to transfer apps to it as older Android phones and tablets would let you. But you can still transfer documents, PDF files, songs and stored videos to the card to lighten the load on the device. That helps out tremendously, especially if you have enough songs to take up a gig of storage, videos to take up the same amount of space, and a bunch of documents like textbooks for school. But you still have to limit your app selection to just a couple of games (if they're big ones), and apps.Ultimately, I found it a very useful device, but the storage limitations had me look elsewhere for a 7 inch device (I settled on the Nexus 7, 32 gb and with better specs but lacking Samsung's lovely TouchWiz that makes using the device such a pleasant experience). As for the Tab 2, I didn't return it. I felt it was still a great device. So now I downloaded an app designed for parents to customize the user experience on it that way my son can play his games and watch his videos and read his books on it when we're traveling or at the doctor's office, etc. It still sees a lot of use, just not by me.I would definitely recommend this tablet, but would also advise people to be cautious of memory usage. Many people don't need that much memory and can be fine with a couple of games or a few heavy apps and use it without any problems. It definitely beats most of the competition with the exception of its main rival, the Nexus 7. It wins out over the Kindle Fire HD easily (which I also own), and the Nook Tablet (which I sold due to the lack of apps available for it). Keep in mind, this review is coming from someone who likes to download apps for all sorts of things (games, checkbook, word processors, photo editing, etc.) so this is why it gets a more negative review than others might give it. For the price, however, I'd easily say this is one of the best choices out there and still recommend it for those looking for a great tablet at an affordable price (almost unbeatable price depending on where/when you buy it).
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Its a tablet right for my interests and with many possibilities and to get into the world of tablets has a affordable price relationship.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|great product from samsung... nothing to compare with theese generic tablets with a dual core & 1 gb ram in the market. the screen is great for videos, doesn't change the colors when you see it from another angle, is pretty fast... great tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I like the samsung galaxy tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi), the product seems to be in a perfect condition. I rate it 5.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great product. I feel sorry for you if you do not have one. I am loyal to samsung because they make great products. Next to my friends newer Nexus, I would choose this galaxy tab. Good stuff!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung Galaxy Tab is great .... It has Flash, slot for a Memory card & will accept most of Google Plays apps. Ice Cream Sandwich is fast & it works perfect. I'm extremely happy with it ... Oh yea it's lots cheaper than the I-Pad
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My first tablet was the iPad 1. I liked it but was big bulky and more than I was looking for. When I found this it seemed like the right size for taking everywhere you wanted to go. After treading good reviews I decided to get it and was glad I did. Now I basicaly do everything I need to do on this little tablet. Recommend it to anyone.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have been very happy with my Samsung Galaxy tab. That said I use it primarily as a reader and the kindle application works just fine. The times i have used it as web browser it seems to work well, except it will occasionally direct me to a mobile website as if i was on a phone. I also seem to have problems playing some videos that are on websites. if you are looking for a solid android tablet i would highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy tab 2 (7").
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|When i bought this tablet, was experiencing slow performance and freezing. A few days later came a large update. Solved all of the issues i was having. Boy was i glad! Thought i had made a mistake with this. Really enjoying it now. Does everything i expected it to do and more. I can see why these 7in tablets are becoming popular. As always Amazon delivered on time and the packaging was great. You can't miss with this if 7in and Android is your cup of tea!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|After reviewing all the different tablets available, I decided to go with Samsung. This one has been great. No regrets on this purchase.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I been using the tablet for a week now and I couldn't be happier, have to say coming from apple products it did took me around 2 days to learn all the tricks and functions but on the 3 day it was a whole different story. The screen may not be as smooth as the ipad but my galaxy is more versatile and can do way more things than my ipad, the size is just what I need it no to big or small I take it everywhere I go, I downloaded movies, games, songs, book, netflix, HBO GO, you name it.I was not to impress with the first version of android but this new one ICS is great I'm definitely and android fan.The only drawback that I found so far is not able to download apps to the micro schc but other than that great product from Samsung and Google.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great tablet. It performs better than i expected and i couldnt be happier with the decision to buy it. The camera takes better than my canon digital camera (ive already had 5 people comment how clear and vivid the pictures are) and the video quality is great as well! If you are considering buying this my advice would be to go ahead and get it. I promise you wont be disappointed
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I received my new Samsung Galaxy 2 Tablet when promised and I love it.Thanks for the good service, I'll buy again!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Do not buy this item if you plan on doing any tethering from your phone. The internal components will not connect. I called customer service and they were completely useless and really didn't care. I'm sending it back. I purchased the ASUS and tried the IPad and all works well.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really like this thing. I thought it was going to be laggy and suck but i found that it responds quite fast. Yeah some things dont work as it should but. Its not a computer its a tablet and the youtube application sucks in this tablet and sucks on ios. it even sucks on pc but hey. thats cuz they keep adding removing bloking stuff etc and what not. so its google's fault. I have been using it mostly for chat and listenting to music (flac and other lossless formats) playing some games and browsing (although not as much as i still prefer the desktop browser experience)Been playing a game called StrikeFleet Omega. Pretty good i recommend it. Though i would prefer to play it on a bigger screen. Another one that is pretty good is called TowerDefense thumbs up for those two games. One that was a let down was plants vs zombies. I decided to try the filtered apk before buying it to prevent it wouldnt work on ICS and it didnt. So i didnt buy it after all. Realized there are tons of complaints about the game not working on Ice Cream Sandwich. But hey what do you expect from the guys at EA. Which are the ones publishing the games for popcap.About the tablet. Nice audio output. I have been using PowerAmp the paid edition and it works great. Sounds nice and i have a portable DAP i use from nuforce to improve the audio experience. Video plays great as well although i rather watch movies on a big screen.It sounds ok when the audio is being played by the speakers. One thing i hated is that there is almost zero accesories for this thing. It has a really good screen. and i would recommend for whoever wants to buy this to use swiftkey keyboard instead of the samsung one. only thing good about the samsung keyboard is that it has a TAB key on it.Why is it the iPad killer for me? well for once its not as heavy as the iPad. It handles well on video calls thru skype or tang, yeah it doesnt have tons of apps. but then again i dont really like the ios closed environment whole thing. and that u have to be married with itunes.Im thinking of selling this one and getting the nexus 7 with jelly bean.Will update this review as i get more around it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Firstly, I ended up returning this because it was sealed but used, and kept crashing, but that aside, here are some important things to note:If you have Google Music, don't expect this to download any of your music to the SD card. It doesn't. It saves to the internal memory.Same for apps - saves to internal memory.Same for photos - saves to internal memory.Tried to figure out how to get it to save anything to the SD, but it appears you can't. As I said though, after receiving a used but sealed Tab, I gave up. In addition, the 8GB is more like 5, so don't expect to have much internal memory use.I'll keep searching to see if they update to allow more use of the SD, at which point I may buy it again as its a good unit, but right now it's pretty useless for what I expected.Gave 3 stars because this isn't really Samsung's fault.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|LOVE MY GALAXY TAB 2 7.0. I BOUGHT THIS WITH A 32GB SD CARD, I THOUGHT I COULD LOAD APPLICATIONS AND EVERYTHING TO THE SD HARD BUT NO. I CAN'T DOWNLOAD AN FILE STRAIGHT TO MY SD CARD. THAT REALLY SUCKS... I HAVE TO BE COPYING FILES FROM THE TABLET TO THE SD CARD...HOPE SAMSUNG WILL MAKE A FIX FOR THIS... ITS LIKE SD CARD DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE IN THIS TABLET
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am a first-time tab user and I must say I've really enjoyed this product.As for positives, I found that the screen is very clear and responsive. Also, the apps load quite quickly and IR remote is a neat accessory; I actually prefer its channel guide over the one provided through my cable carrier. I've had no issues streaming movies through Netflix or watching videos on YouTube, although it would be nice if the Netflix movies were a bit clearer. Finally, it's extremely easy to drag photos or music from iTunes and drop them into Kies (the Galaxy software). Once you do this it will sync right up with the tab.As for negatives, the power button and volume control are in a terrible location. It's way too easy to accidentally hit these buttons while holding the device sideways. Maybe a future model will put these controls on the front? Also, I could sketch a better picture than this tab could take.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love Samsung products, so I got this tablet over the weekend from a local store. From first impression it was lovely. I did a couple of Android updates and it was good to go for me. Will use it mainly while I'm on the go to enjoy the Android experience.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Love the tablet, fast, responsive and very well built. It was a gift for my girlfriend, I'm buying another one for me any time soon, it has an excellent cost/benefit relation.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I decided to go with the 7 inch Galaxy Tab over the Kindle Fire mainly because I didn't want to be stuck with only 8GB of hard drive space. This tablet works well, is fast, and does everything that I need (but I don't need much). This is essentially a toy for me and is great at playing games and checking things on facebook and twitter.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am very pleased with my purchase of this tablet. It is everything I'd hoped for and more! It takes great pics & video, has plenty of memory, and brilliant color touch screen.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Received the item in the allotted time. I had to ship it out to another country and haven't heard any bad news on the performance.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought the Galaxy for traveling. Laptop just too big and heavy for me on planes, so this is just the perfect size. I can put it in my carry on bag without having to have the laptop. The screen is sooo clear and easy to read and learning how to use it was easy. It comes with the household charger only, so I ordered one for my car as well. I just wish I could have afforded the 10 inch screen! But dont let that stop you from buying the 7 inch model. The only problem I have with it is when I play my HIDDEN OBJECT games! But I imagine even on a 10 inch screen, those iddy-biddy things would be hard to find. I would definitely buy another one.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am very happy with the Galaxy Tab 2. I had a Ipad3 initially, but returned it because it had many capabilities and features I would never use. Waste of money for me. Also too big for my use. The Galaxy does everything I want and it is a much more convenient size. To me, the clarity of the screen is every bit as good as the Ipad. Excellent product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is not what I was expecting. It has some good features like android 4.0, but at the same time has some problems, it freezes from time to time, you can not watch some videos online because flash doesn't work on it. I don't know yet if I'm returning it and waiting to have enough money to get a better one. I don't really see much difference between Samsung galaxy 1 and 2.UPDATE October 16, 2012: It freezes all the time, and when it does, it gets very hot and it is very difficult to turn it off or reboot it because it doesn't respond at all. I am very desappointed.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|All of the other reviews concentrate on the screen, which is great. However, I wanted to use it for two things that I can't get. One is a reader for Adobe Digital books that can be taken out digitally from my library. Two to view my watchlist from Amazon prime streaming videos. I can see my Netflix on the tablet. I have 3 reader programs, kindle, kobo and nook on the tablet and they're fine but each time I try the fix for Adobe Digital it gets blocked out. I have tried various fixes including contracting both Amazon support and Samsung support with no real remedy. For that reason, although I enjoy many of the features, I am using my old Kobo ereader for travel reading and using my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 for a few games and books I purchase for kindle, nook and kobo I'm considering the new kobo glo as I do like the feature of being able to read in the dark and I know that the kobo will get Adobe digital, even if I have to use the fire wire to do it. The Samsung Galaxy Tab was not a good purchase for my needs and cost a fair amount of $, I wish I had returned it when I first discovered that issues.

tablet_galaxy_tab|*** The Positives:When I powered this thing on... What a beautiful display!! It is lovely. No wonder S^MSUNG is taking over the TV display market.The Android operating system is the best. I guess I am personally biased toward Android because the HTC Incredible got me hooked on the simplicity and openness of the OS. From the main screen there are five panes you can access with a slider, if you are familiar with how the Androids operate.*** The Negatives:Right out of the box, I had a sinking feeling when I saw the other end of the USB charger/data cable had a S^AMSUNG connector on it instead of a micro-USB. I can see it now. I go off on a trip and I have not packed that specific cable for the Tab. I can't get that cable at Target or Radio Shack!! I have to get it from... S^AMSUNG. It will not get to me from S^MSUNG before I have to go back home or go off to the next destination of my trip. If I had wanted stupid charger/connector hassles like that, then I would have gotten an Apple iPad with it's confusing array of which-generation-connector-goes-with-which-generation-iPad conundrum. OR I would have gotten a BlackBerry Playbook (*giggle*) where the Playbook insists on having the charger's data pins shorted to permit the power pins to charge the Playbook's battery! I kept that sinking feeling about the Tab pushed down in my heart, because I was trying SO HARD to rationalize being able to keep this neat device with it's beautiful display.Next con: When the Display Brightness is set on &#34;Auto&#34; the display is constantly set to be too dim for whatever the lighting conditions are. Manually adjusting it is easy enough, but why can't I set it to *automatically* adjust to how bright I want it to be? Also, when the Display Brightness is set to &#34;Auto&#34;, whatever the Tab does to set the backlighting down to it's too dim setting, well that just makes the backlighting flicker. It's annoying!The con that broke the camel's back: The micro-SD card would not stay in the micro-SD card slot! Was it the plastic-snappy-hinge-door that was supposed to keep the micro-SD card in place? It didn't. If I put some finger pressure on the closed plastic-snappy-hinge-door while my 32GB niblet was in there, a display at the top of the (beautiful) screen would say &#34;Preparing SD card&#34;. But the instant I took my finger away from the plastic-snappy-hinge-door, the status at the top of the (still) beautiful screen would tell me that the &#34;SD card was unexpectedly removed!&#34; When I called the 1-800-SAMSUNG support line to resolve this problem the troubleshooter did determine that I had not installed the card correctly. I had not pushed the micro-SD card in far enough. HOWEVER, to push the micro-SD card in far enough, I would &#34;have to use a gemclip or a safety pin to carefully push&#34; the outer edge of the micro-SD card into the Tab deep past the plastic of the slot until it went &#34;click&#34;. I successfully tried this and the micro-SD card worked in the micro-SD slot. An optimist might say, &#34;Well! Now that you have that there micro-jobber clicked into yer hoo-hah-hole just right, ya might never have to mess with it ever again! :-D &#34; To which I say ripping movies for long trips, transfering other bits of data, video and pictures to and from the Tab is going to be a constant battle with micro-SD micro-card micro-slot micro-surgery with the S^MSUNG-recommended &#34;gemclip or a safety pin&#34;. (For younger readers: The &#34;gemclip&#34; is an archaic metalic wire device old-timers used to use to hold paper documents together before the &#34;floppy disc&#34; came along. The advent of the &#34;floppy disc&#34; in the late 1970's and early 1980's effectively banned the easily magnetized &#34;gemclip&#34; from the office because those &#34;gemclips'&#34; magnetic force would erase devastating amounts of kilobytes from the said floppy discs.) (Also for the younger readers: The &#34;safety pin&#34; is another metallic wire device used in the 1950's and 1960's to cinch the waist of a cloth diaper onto a baby's butt.) I guess I was just hoping to be able to change micro-SD cards with my standard-issue hands, the way I do with my phone, camera, handheld scanner and every other device I use that requires memory! Every time I go on a trip, I will not think to pack a gemclip, nor shall I pack a safety pin! I don't even have these things from 3 to 6 decades ago IN MY HOUSE! AND I'M A BIT OF A PACKRAT!!!! So... I micro-extracted my micro-card, went to my Amazon account and clicked &#34;return&#34;.Bottom line: Beautiful display, but there are a lot of gaffes in the Galaxy Tab's design which were going to be so annoying in the years of ownership to come. If you are seriously considering this Tab, make sure my three cons, which were evident on the first day out of the box, are not a concern for you.

tablet_galaxy_tab|It can run just a few hour after fully charged. The battery seems not good. I prefer my old Ipad. Totally dispointed.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Great product, hate all the third party apps that cannot be removed. Not allowing third party apps is one thing that I really like about Apple products.

tablet_galaxy_tab|My husband loves his new toy. He has put a lot of new apps on his tablet.Glad I got him this gift.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Thank you for the an amazing product!!! I like seeing that it was shipped by Amazon. I must admit it made me feel a little more secure. Thanks again!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I initially ordered this for my mother, and the first week of usage it began to fail. The tablet would crash and freeze. Amazon has been awesome in providing me with a replacement right away, but the replacement is worse. It won't follow the touch commands and it still crashes. The tablet has more than enough memory in it and the ram usage is low so there is no excuse for it to freeze so frequently. Needless to say, I am pretty disappointed in the product.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for a recent vacation to Cancun. I wanted to be able to read and watch movies on the plane, read at the beach, check email occasionally and check my favorite websites. And I wanted to be able to do all of this without lugging around the books, magazines and a laptop for the whole week. I used to have an android phone so it was all very easy to figure out how to use. I chose the Galaxy Tab from all of the android tablets out there for 3 reasons, 1-Samsung makes a good product and 2- the external microSD storage and 3- for use with my SmartTV.The built in memory is only 8GB so I threw in a 16GB microSD and (foolishly) thought I basically have 24GB of memory. Here comes big drawback number 1... the external memory can only be used for pictures and videos taken with the built-in camera. There is an app that will allow some apps to be saved to the SD but I was hoping I'd be able to download movies to the SD. I'm going to assume its my fault for not researching that further before purchase. Maybe there is a way to do it and I haven't figured it out yet but I kinda doubt it. I was able to download 4 movies to the device but when I went to install a game I purchased I found I was out of memory.Big drawback number 2- with the Galaxy Tab you have the Samsung App Store, the Google Play store and the Amazon App store to find your entertainments... the problem is the 3 of these combined are woefully inferior to the selection available from Apple Apps & iTunes (especially for movies & magazines).My lesson learned: I shoulda coughed a bit more cash and bought an iPad mini. And if decide that I really do need a tablet on a regular basis then that's what I'm going to do.If you're on a tight budget though and these drawbacks aren't a big deal for you then you can't go wrong with this device.

tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, 7.0 Can not..CAN NOT save any Google Play Apps to the MicroSD Card. I contacted Samsung Technical and Engineering support was told that at this time Ice Cream Sandwich does not support saving Google Play Apps of any kind to MicroSD Card.So you are left with only about 4Gigs of space to save to, and if your a heavy App user like me this is a GLARING FLAW!!I am returning mine right away, until I know GOOGLE fixes this!!MAJOR FLAW: Can't Download ANY GOOGLE APPS to MicroSD Card!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm very unhappy. While the Tab itself is great, the only reason I got it over an iPad is so I could have a flash player. Guess what - the box says "supports Flash Player", and the research I did before purchasing included the Flash Player as a selling feature. Nope! Now I have to return it. I just chatted with Samsung and was informeed that for the version I have Flash Player was removed. So disappointed in Samsung!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I generally like this tab. Has the latest Android OS, responds fast, offers multiple options. It seems, though, that most satisfied users compare this tab to a Kindle. I don't own a Kindle. But I do own an Acer Iconia which, performance-wise, supersedes the Galaxy Tab 7.0 even a year after it was released.The reason I took the first star off is that ostensibly this Tab comes with 8GB - it's advertised as such, and says so on the box. However, what it does not say is that it most of its internal memory is taken up by the system and by numerous preloaded application that you can't get rid of. What you have out of the box is barely 4 GB of memory available for your use. If you think that's enough, think again.ALL of the apps that you plan to download to your new pretty Galaxy are programed to go to your internal memory, and there is no option in the settings that allow you to move the app to your SD card. Samsung opted to label the internal memory as "SDcard" and the external memory as "extSDcard." So not only do your apps go straight to your internal precious memory (of which you only have 4gb to begin with), all the data that's generated by that app also goes to the internal memory. The only thing that's possible to use out of external SD is media - videos and pictures. Games, offline maps, word processing apps - all go to internal memory. I contacted Samsung on this before I bought the devise as I saw couple of users mentioning it here on Amazon. After 30 min of conversation with sales person and a TECH (!) department I was assured that I can move the apps to the external memory card. That's the reason for taking off a second star - incompetent customer service. I should have read reviews on Samsung website - all this was discussed by users there.Don't know if I'll keep it, aside from the above reasons the Tab is fine, especially at this price point.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I had wanted this Tab since the day it came out several years ago. Finally got it when it was $179.00 (money I really didn't have to spend, but the price was good). Initially - happy. Then it started needing to be Factory Re-set on a regular basis. Photos - all gone. Other settings -- all gone. Games -- all gone. Over and over. Now I don't take pix with it, don't use any apps that will store info, only to be dumped when I have to reset it. Sad, sad, sad. Incredibly disappointing. The first time I contacted Samsung, apparently this is such a routine problem that they have a lengthy how-to pdf already to go!Don't waste your money. I might as well have set my $179.00 on fire in the front yard!Get something else. Again: sad and very disappointing!

tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung Galaxy tab 2 (SG2) was my first tablet and I bought it based on the preponderance of favorable reviews and affordable price. Unfortunately I had the problem noted in some of the negative reviews; it would usually not stay connected to my home wifi for more than 10 or 20 minutes at a time. I have a Roku that never loses connection and when I checked the signal strength on the SG2 (when it was connected) it always said "very strong" or "strong" so the problem was with the SG2, not with my wifi singal. The keyboard function was very sensitive and worked flawlessly but tapping to bring up a web page after a search was very glitchy often requiring multiple taps. I was initially excited to have the tablet and eager for it to work and might have been willing to get used to the inconsistent tap sensitivity but I failed to convince myself that the connection issue was OK. I returned the SG2. It was such a disappointing experience that I haven't decided if I will try any other tablet.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Hello all . I love my new SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB. IT, S THE BEST, I, VE BEENHAVING LOTS OF FUN WITH IT LIKE SENDING THIS EMAIL.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|To start I have an iPad2 so I am not sure if that is a fair comparison to this particular Tablet. This Tab is much faster than the iPad and handles Flash. That is where my likes for it end. I have to use a Stylus pen in order to type and email or surf the net with this Tab. I find using my fingers (I consider myself to have average hands) is a pain in the rear. Again I am not sure if it is due to the size of the screen or if it is just this Tab.The iPad2 is far more responsive than this is hands down. I purchased this blind (not playing with it in a store) which is rare for me. I like to see things in person prior to buying just for this reason. I won't return it b/c it will do as long as I have a Stylus handy. I would not buy this one again nor would I recommend it.For the price of this one I guess the theory of you get what you pay for is in order. I would much rather use my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone over this.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Really enjoying our tablet!!!!! Turning my hubby into a techy~ Perfect size~ perfect price~ perfect gift~ Very very pleased with our purchase.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a very valuable product, better than other pads I used. Even better than Ipad.I recomend it for everyone.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The first thing I did was root my tablet so I could run the rest of the apps such as an ad blocker. But plenty of phone to SD apps work fine from stock.I am downloading at over 5 Mbps (4x faster than DSL and 2.5x faster than 4G) I tried holding the tablet at different areas and got the same result. I even sat on mine and still downloaded at 5594 kbpsJust like any tablet their operating system is proprietary just like a Kindle to keep the average user from making bad kernel mistakes. Some folks use an aftermarket firmware (free - Android Open Source Project) Cyanogenmod or APOK. My Kindle Fire was stolen and I paid the extra $50 for the Tab 2.0 to get the camera and microphone. Love-love-love it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is an amazing deal on a tablet. Not only is the price great and affordable, but the instant useability is amazing. It does EVERYTHING any other tablet can do and at an affordable price! We decided to purchase Samsung brand based on our great experiences with Samsung smart phones and other long-lasting products we've purchased. There are more apps than we could possibly need! We chose to buy a wifi only tablet because we almost never use any data on our smart phones. Why pay twice for internet? We have wifi in the house as well as find it nearly everywhere we go. The few times we'd need it, we still have our Samsung Galaxy smart phone to back us up! So much fun for only $250, I can't believe people are paying $600 for an ipad!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|My husband is not all tech, but what he knows is good for this product. Down side is the table gets frozen or the image for the camera goes down and it doesn't always want to work with us. Today for example the table doesn't want to change to a horizontal position it just want's to stay on the vertical position. Maybe we did something to the settings but it gives us problems once in a while.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and it worked great! It was much easierthan lugging around my iPad 2 or HP Touchpad. (both 10-inch tablets)The 7-inch size really made a difference. When viewing 16:9 movies,it's not that much smaller.However, I started having second thoughts and bought the Nexus 7also. After two days, I couldn't stand it. The software(Jelly Bean)was great, but the Asus hardware was terribly low-quality.I have returned the Nexus 7 and will be keeping the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This product is and does everything it is supposed to do. The only negative I can say (and it's not the fault of the product) is the size of screen. I must break down and stop buying: Kindle Fires, Nooks, and this product when I really want/need a full screen. It is a wonderful product if the screen size does not bother you. It is the next best thing to an iPad as can be found (along with the other products I mentioned and purchased. I'm saving up and getting what I truly want/need -> an expensive iPad! If I had just not purchased these three items, I'd have the money to get an iPad. Last thing: It was ordered and I received it *extremely* quickly. One thing Amazon does and does well is shipping the product! I love you Amazon!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|HERE IS THE BAD: If you buy this product, first thing set the screen lock on. It has a weird problem of switching from portrait to landscape on the SLIGHTEST moves. Another big problem. This is the first Android device I have purchased where the device does not show up as an External Drive when connected to my PC. It requires you to sync the device. The only fast way to copy files is to pull the micro-sd card out and put it in a reader. THAT STINKS! Also, proprietary connector is annoying. You have to keep yet another cable around. Why not using micro-usb? One last thing, its slippery as a snake. Would a textured back be too much to ask for?HERE IS THE GOOD: The screen looks great I love the Blu-Tooth, drives my wireless boombox to perfection Micro-SD is great and cheap, tons of storage Does anything a tablet should do, (lets face it I am still not a tablet fan) It is fast, coming from some who purchased the first android tablets they have come a LONG way

tablet_galaxy_tab|I could be completely happy with my new tablet if I didn't have the issue with weak WiFi reception. In the places where my computer has very good reception - 4 bars, and iPad shows 3 bars I can get only 1-2 bars on my new Galaxy - "weak". The same happened in every spot with free WiFi, like Barnes and Noble. etc - 1-2 bars maximum. I can get 4 bars only within 10 feet from my router.I am wondering if this is common problem or I just got defective item. Does anyone else have such problem? I really like this tablet and want to keep it.Update:Thanks everyone for replying!Update2: When my Galaxy shows 1-2 bars it is actually does not deliver proper signal, connection is very slow , or it doesn't connect at all.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The item appears to be in good working order. However, while the description showed item as &#34;new&#34; it is clearly a refurbished item. Packaging had been opened. Screen was smudged with fingerprints and it smelled like smoke (gross!). Very displeased, Amazon!!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I ordered the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 in July 2012, and actually had to exchange it for the same item just over a month later. The issue: it will shut down without warning, even with a charged battery. This is actually an issue I've had with the replacement tab that I've had since the end of August as well. There is no warning when this happens, it just does. It isn't "frequent" but I would say it occurs a couple times a month. Generally, I have to plug the charger back in (which is strange b/c there is ALWAYS a charge when it shuts down) and then after a few minutes, I can power the tablet back on and it's fine. It's an inconvenience, but it's not worth the effort of me exchanging it for a 2nd time and I believe I'm past the point of returning it at this time. I will cope.I read A LOT of review of this tablet before I settled on it. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 definitely had some mixed reviews, but I opted to go for it as I thought, no product is 100% perfect (that's definitely been confirmed for me). It does the job it's supposed to for the most part, I prefer the 7inch size as it's more manageable to hold on to.Would I recommend it to a friend? I did before I had issues of my own, but for the future, I may not recommend it to someone who would be impatient with it's flaws

tablet_galaxy_tab|A nice tablet especially for the price. I wanted the microSD option that higher end tables didn't offer.PROS:You can get a USB host adapter so you can plug USB devices into it.You can use a bluetooth wireless keyboard and it responds quicklyGood battery life. 9 hours of constant display use and days of battery life when I allow the screen to turn off while idle.Very slim and lightweight.CONS:Placement of the power button next to the volume buttons isn't idle. I keep hitting the power button by mistake and locking/powering off the screen. Annoying. It would have be better to have the power button on the top instead.Android lacks a decent alternative to Microsoft Office. Opening Office documents from others tend to always have some formatting problem compared to actual Office programs.No standard micro USB port for charging/data sync. It'd be nice to not need an adapter to attach USB devices either.Comes with lots of store apps. More free media content would have been nice.No 5.0ghz wireless support, but I prefer the lower price over that feature.Would have liked a 8.9 or larger screen size for the same price.No LED notification light to alert you about e-mails or other notifications while main screen is asleep.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Although not the Nexus 7, but this tablet is a must have for android freaks like me. It's very neat and does the job of storing all media and powerful enough to play games like Sonic and Shadowgun .. etc. I wanted nexus 7 since it's pure google, but this tab has extra space for extra memory (i bought 32gb immediately!). It's a bit laggy though but i got another launcher which makes it quite fast. Will wait for 4.1I don't regret buying this at all, but I'd still say, if you are choosing between this and the nexus 7, go with the nexus 7 if you don't mind limited storage space (i.e. 8 or 16gb).
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|First, the downsides of the tablet:-It only has 8 GB of RAM, and half of that is taken by the bloatware Samsung has installed on the tablet, and cannot be removed.-The cameras are horrible. The front-facing camera is VGA resolution and guaranteed to make you look bad in video chat, and the rear facing camera is 3 megapixels and fixed focus, so things like bar code scanners won't work with it. There is no flash or assistive light. Basically, if you ever think you want to use the camera for anything, buy something else.-There is no indicator LED on the tablet, for notifications or charging status or anything else.-Finding cases for it is tough.-Some applications don't work too well, as they assume a bigger screen.-Doesn't support larger MicroSD cards, only HC.-The connector is proprietary, so you can't use standard USB variants to charge it.-No HD out, even through the docking connector.-No 5 GHz WiFi.-Bluetooth compatibility issues with SPP class 0 devices.Here are the upsides:+In build quality, comparing it to the only other 7" tablet on the market (the Acer Iconia) for the same price you get a thinner and lighter tablet that feels vastly better. The Samsung is really well built, the materials are nice to the touch, and it's comfortable to hold.+It's fairly responsive (unless you load it up with apps).+The screen is nice, and the touch interface works well.+I've been satisfied with the battery life.+It's very good value for the money.

tablet_galaxy_tab|At first the tablet works just fine. After a few weeks of use, applications crash when you try to open the onscreen keyboard. This makes the device completely useless. The only fix is to reset it to factory conditions. Of course there is no way to retrieve the data and every app must be manually re-installed.Aside from this glaring flaw, the tablet is perfectly fine. It pains me to send a mint condition tablet back to the manufacturer. I'm waiting for the cheaper Nexus tablet by Asus which should be announced by Google any week now. I may have just been unlucky but I think I'm a little burnt-out on Samsung and need a change.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Just bought his Samsung Tab(2) with ICE. This apparently comes only with 8 GB and now has Ice Cream Sandwich. Ice Cream Sandwich has disabled the option to move Applications to the SD card. You are limited to the 8GB space for Apps, and can only use the SD card for storage of pictures, Mp3's and files. This is a change from Froyo Android on Samsung devices where you could easily move them. 8GB will be a problem as you find more apps to install. My 16GB phone would have run out of space long ago.Other than that it seems to be a fine device. My first experience with a 7". I am rethinking a 10" and even an iPad now. At least with Apple you get the GB's you buy without the promise of "expandable" memory that is really limit to file storage.Samsung should be ashamed since this is really a deception.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have two I pads so I am compairing the TAB 2 to what I am use to. I did not want the grandkids playing with the IPAD and possibly breaking it, so I purchased a Galaxy Tab 2 for the kids to use. It looked great and was the perfect size for them. When setting it up the first thing I noticed is I kept hitting the switch by accident turning it off, very annoying. It would probably not be a problem with a case. The next thing I noticed was the touch screen was erratic, sometimes it would work ok and other times it would not. I had to touch the screen several times to insert the typing and sometimes it would not work at at all, this was annoying and troublesome. I had to use my Ipad to type. When I was at a web site, which was not always easy to get to, it did not have the same content as an ipad or computer would have, (TD Amertrade)so it was useless. It is also very slow and sluggish at times. There is no LED light for the camera, so you can only use it during the daylight hours or indoors with a light. I was very disapointed with it because i was hoping to swap over to a Galaxy from the Ipad, I am not a geek and do not feel any loyality to Apple I was hoping to change over to a Galaxy because they offer a Memory card while Apple Ipad does not. This was a rush job to compete with other small tabs.The bottom line is that this tablet is for Kids not an adult who needs to be on-line a lot checking accounts, emails and submitting applications. I am going to keep it because I got it for the kids to play games. I plan on getting a Kindle and trying that out as well, if its better than the TAB 2 then I'll return the TAB 2

tablet_galaxy_tab|This product worked good at first... a little over a month later, it does not work, will not turn on. Hope something can be done about this, as of right now I do not recommend purchasing from this vendor... buy from Costco, its cheaper and they take back anything within 2 years of purchase not 30 days!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I liked the tab in many ways - responsive, nice screen (may not be the best out there, but quite good for the price), good speaker quality. Had to return it due to the poor quality wifi radio. Worked fine within 10 feet of my wifi router. In the next room - I frequently kept getting wifi &#34;Authentication Error&#34; (while signal quality displayed as &#34;Very Strong&#34;), walk over next to the router, and it works great. Followed instructions - disabled power saving of the wifi, enabled static ip - same issue. Chatted with 1st level support - no new info, referred me to email-based !!! 2nd level support, that woudl contact me in 2 !! days. Return (too bad).By the way, this tab didn't work at all with my 5 Ghz wifi network with a hidden SSID's (somewhat minor point) - issue above was with a 2.4 ghz with a visible ssid.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have ipod touch and Acer tablet 10 inch. I was looking for something portable yet big enough to read ebooks and do basic web/email and watch videos. Considering the price and options to add android apps, I decided to get this tablet over Kindle. It's an okay tablet but not great. The screen gets dirty faster than the two mobile devices I have. It's not as vivid as apple products for sure. Micro SD card expansion is somewhat misleading as the android OS that comes with does not let the tablet to store apps to external SD card. There's just little over 4 GB space available on internal memory and that's just not enough. I have some basic apps downloaded and no game apps at all. And I already filled up more than half of what's available. So if you're planning to download many apps and videos and magazines, 8GB internal storage is not enough at all. The expandable micro SC option looks great as if it'll add more storage but it does not work that way at all. Apps will not be stored in the external SD card at all. The default apps come with the tablet cannot be deleted and just take up space in the limited memory space.Also it says it's compatible with Adobe Flash Player. Adobe apparently has discontinued Flash Player support for newer android OS and this tablet does not come with Adobe Flash Player plug in and does not work. So that's also misleading.I hope android will provide its OS updates in near future with an option to store apps to external sd card. So will adobe with its Flash Player.

tablet_galaxy_tab|good day please send the bill to the box product so they can send it to my country Venezuela or give me back the money

tablet_galaxy_tab|El puerto esta malo y no carga la bateria. Un total robo la pantalla esta rayada me parece un total abuso que digan que estaba como nueva

tablet_galaxy_tab|I called several times Samsung Support regarding downloading pictures from my sd card to my tablet. Nobody was able to help. I had answers which ranged from "The Tablet does not support direct downloads, you need a pc" to asking me $99.99 to give me an answer.I am truly disappointed. I bought the tablet to be able to transfer pictures from my camera, which is a Samsung PL 200, when I travel.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7" for $180. I was not pleased with the screen res, the build, the Android version, proprietary apps, . I have a smartphone with an HD display (Razr HD)and it looks great. After using the Galaxy for a few I noticed how badly the pixels stood out everywhere. I could not get past the non HD display, it's ugly. After one day of use it also seemed to run a bit slow and had a few other minor quirks. I knew I would not be happy with it for the long termAfter some additional research I switched to the Nexus 7 and I am very pleased to have done so. The display is beautiful. It runs better with the better processor and Android 4.2.2. All Google all the way is perfect for me.If you buy a Nexus over a Galaxy you will be giving up the camera and SD expansion slot.I am able to live with this since I have way too many cameras already. I also do not store a lot on my devices so 16G will be adequate. There are also ways to stream music and video from a flash drive using app Nexus Media Importer and a USB OTG cable.[...]So, the Nexus is much a nicer tablet for only $20 more. If you are debating between the two, now you know where I stand.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Lo compre como un regalo para mi sobrino de 8 a&ntilde;os, y hasta los momentos se ha comportado muy bien el equipo, que apesar de ser basico, al realizar la actualizaci&oacute;n del sistema operativo, la tablet empieza a trabajar mucho mejor.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|In general it's a great tablet, though the issue about not been able to connect to the HDTV for me it's a very big flaw, I rather prefer to pay a little more but have all the connectivity necessary for avery need. Wrong for Samsung.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I just wanted to thank you guys with all the info you provided in your reviews. I have purchased this product for someone else. I am not a dumb person but lack in the world of electronics. I am disabled and this was all I could afford. I just know Samsung has good products, since all my phones are Samsung. Now I feel confident I made the right choice. They are not tech savy either but they are selfless and would enjoy something fancy. Thanks again from a girl who knows nothing about this stuff!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Enjoying this tablet each and every day. Learning new things about it all the time. So far, I have been very happy with this purchase. Useful and fun. I recommend this tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I just got one of these!!! There sooo cool... my daughter absolutely LOVESit!!!! There's sooo much to do on it I think I'm going to need to get another since my teenager doesn't want to give me mines back!!! Lol whoever purchases this item will LOVE it I'm sure!!!!!! Good luck!!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|A useful tool, though not perfect. I find the touch screen annoying, since it tends to jump somewhere I don't want to go whenever I accidentally touch part of the screen. A stylus would work better IMHO. Other than that problem, the unit does everything it claims. Access the Internet, use e mail, read books, watch movies etc etc. It won't replace my laptop or desktop, but it's much easier to carry around.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I love my new Samsung tablet it just got here Sunday two days early then it should of been. So far so good I'm liking the tablet more and more it's what I wanted for a long time other tablets are to expensive these days. This was in my price range, I'm still getting the hang of it. I got it because my wife is always on the laptop so I never have time on it, so I went to plan "B" and got me this Samsung for me, I think if you are looking for a tablet that is a real good for the price and works great then don't look any further. Because your going to go crazy like I did looking for a tablet and looking at other people comments and your going to pass up on this Samsung Galaxy.Question: This is for someone who has the Samsung is there anyway I can get some music on here with out paying these stupid fees! And maybe movies! If there not a way then at less I tried......Thanks

tablet_galaxy_tab|fnally did it i got samsung galaxy 2 tablet the 7 inch model i love it it was only 249 it run android4 i even got a cool case with abluetooth keyboard it is like a baby laptop i purchased a asus transformer prime 10 inch at xmas according 2 cnet &other places it was suppose 2 b the best tablet available. It cost 549.00 for the 16gb model. Afger a couple days i returned it cause it was slow and akward 2 hold and it was way 2 pricey 4 what it did. In comparison this i can hold one handed withlut straining my wrist the on screen keyboard is easy 2 use great screen i tested netflix movies not as good as my tv but still excellent picture and sound as well the speakers work nicely it also is much quicker and performs better then thd asus it doesnt have all the bells and whistles but it has alot more then the kindle or new google pad it was worth an extra 50 bucks it even has an ir blaster so it can work a universal remote. Very nice camera sd expansion but it suvks 4 some reasln android 4.0.3 ics does have a button allow u 2 move apps 2 the sd card the sd expansion is only 4 data movies music also there is only one output and it is 30pin connector like apple ipod only the apple cords dont fit that charges and connect to usb u can get adapters that hook up 2 this port that will do hdmi memory reader etc. I have 2 say this is is so cool if u r looking 4 a tablet save some money and go with the galaxy dont get a crappy nook or kindle or pay a fortune 4 ipad or other fancy thing i researched and now am using it i am so happy it is grear

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this product after comparing the different e-readers I was considering purchasing. I looked at the Nook, Kindle, Kindle fire, etc. I read reviews on Amazon as well as went to my local electronics stores to compare in person. I got this product along with others items I ordered at the same time a day earlier than stated when I purchased which is always great. I can't really compare this to other tablets as this is the first one I have owned, but I love it. It's very fast for the processes I use it for (mostly internet searches, Facebook, Twitter, other apps, and reading books on). I love the fact that you can add additional memory which was the main selling point for me on this product over the Kindle fire. I know about Cloud and all of that, but I don't like that you have to be connected to the internet to read your books on Cloud and if I download all of my books and music the storage space on the device would be full in no time. I will be using my tablet a lot while traveling and won't always have internet access at hand. The only downfalls on this product that I have noticed thus far are:1: That it doesn't have a "Swype" keyboard. I have an android phone that has this feature and I love it. There are ones that are downloadable from the android market, but they can store anything you type and I don't particularly like that idea. And2: Hulu does not work on this device (the app or the website) except to add things to watch later from your television, computer, or other device that works with Hulu. Netflix however does work fantastically on this tablet, so that's a big bonus.If you are looking for something that is fast, easy to use, allows extra storage space, and is user friendly I think this would be a good product for you. So far I'm very satisfied. If that changes I will update my review, but I don't see that happening.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I like my tablet.But I'am not happy with te memory, I though i could move some apps to the memory like I did with my cell Galaxy ACE, but after install "App 2 SD" and run it i found this message:"This device does not allow the function to move applications to the SD memory".You only can use 4.69gb of the memory besides the preinstalled apps that you can't remove until you root the deviceI'm going to go Europe I installed several tourist apps like guides and maps from some cities and the memory is almost full.I guess it is a nice device with a big problem of memory.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Over all the tablet is ok, i did not expect the top of the line for 250 and did not get it. What i would like to have known before i bought it is that it's NOT POSSIBLE to store apps on the external sd card (data files are ok). It took a rather long chat with a samsung rep before they admitted that it's a design issue not a software bug.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Unfortunately, from the moment we received it, it was a headache. Would not stay connected to our home WiFi (everything else stays connected fine, including my Samsung Galaxy SIII cell phone) for more than a minute or so. On two occasions when it was actually &#34;connected&#34; it would not complete a download, just kept spinning and spinning. I tried everything. Saw online where many others are having same problem. Also, the touch on the particular Tab 2 we received was very difficult, not smooth like my Galaxy SIII, and it kept rotating the screen for no reason. Maybe it is defective, I don't know but it's definately going back after just two days.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I contacted Samsung and wanted to find out more about the product. Well come to find out it does take Adobe reader but NOT the Adobe Flash player like it advertizes!!!!!!!!!! They say there are no tablets available that can do both applications. Frustrated with tablets!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 after it clearly states it supports Adobe. Got it and it does not support the device. Amazon says you can't refurn open elctronics.....GREAT ! Now I am stuck with something I really need Adobe Flash for. Makes me so angry I should drop my prime membership.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Too slow compared to my IPad. It has only great thing that is having additional memory slot. At least provide adobe flash player to play video clips.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I received my item within the delivery date. My tablet came in its original packaging and also had the sealed sticker on the box. Transaction was smooth and i had no trouble t all.Brand NEW condition.All accessories were included. (usb cord & manual)Will purchase from this seller in the future! :)Sincerely,Satisfied costumer
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I recieved this as a Christmas present and it is wonderful. I don't know how I lived without a tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|after I download some TV shows in media hub,I won't able to delete them. I have try everything to delete them without success I called Samsung last week and was transfered to different departments still did not get anyone talk to me.Finally, I got a transaction number waiting for them to call me back. It has been several days since,still I have not heard from them. I am disappointed at Sumsung
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I dont want one anymore...nothing against the Ipad, but I think the Galaxy Tab 2 fits me better. I like the size and enjoy the technology.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this for my 24 yr of son for Christmas and he loves it! Big enough for what's he wants to do on it and small enough to slip on his pocket
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It meets my needs excellently. I tried another off brand first and it was annoying. This one is relatively quck and never annoying.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it and so do I.I love the expansion port which allows you to get up to 52GB of additional memory which is something that Apple misses the boat on with their Over priced and highly over rated mini iPad.I would buy another one of these in a second and frankly, I'm considering buying one for myself.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm enjoying my tablet I'm still learning how everything works. I'm having a little trouble getting all the books I have archived though.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this tablet in Thanksgiving sale. I arrived very fast even to Hawaii. I am totally satisfied with this tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|El servicio fue r&aacute;pido y efectivo.Precios c&oacute;modos y accesibles.Recomiendo el producto, econ&oacute;mico y muy util.........................................
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|ok, actually I have a question and I know it will probably sound stupid but, does this product come with a charger? I only ask because I saw a sleeve and a charger that could be purchased seperatley. Im wanting to buy this for my son, he is 9, but way into technology and he likes to play with my Kindle fire. So.....
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Samsung galaxy has been one of the most useful devices that people want. I recommend this product. It is very good
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|this is my first tablet, I brought it for my travel use, it's light and small, easy to carry. The only thing is the screen is a little too small, difficult to read the content, I think the 10.1" will be better.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great mini tablet for the price !! Screen is bright and very readable. Check it out against the not yet available iPad mini!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i love it. this tablet has the right size, is perfect, something that i love about it is that it looks and works awesome. the battery last longer than i thought . and has a beautiful video playback
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is the first tablet I've owned and I LOVE it; have a number of apps to choose from and they are very easy to install much better than Apple apps. If you never owned a tablet before this one is for you. The battery life could be a bit better but that's what the charger is for; also purchased a car charger for this product for own the road and at 199 dollars you can't be that with a stick.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung Galaxy 2 is a great product. It is a very portable device and has a great screen resolution that allows you to read and watch movies. I also have the portable keyboard dock that is a great addition to the Tab. The keyboard is well constructed and has a good feel when you are typing
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|got it today and im already having trouble with it. Ive tried 20 times or more to get my wifi to work with it and it doesn't. Ive done more research on it and most people have trouble with that. Do not buy this product you will have trouble with it. Im returning it and just wont buy any tablets, they're not worth a headache...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|So far the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 has exceeded my expectations as a tablet for use on the run. It has a beautiful picture and amazing sound. The setup has been simple and so far I am exceptionally happy. The only reason it hasn't recieved a 5 star review from me is lack of time using it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I love my tab... can't go without it for a day but there is one problem that's really frustrating me. The product description says "8GB Internal Memory" when I check, it shows "4.59GB. Is it just me or have others face this problem?
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm sure you won't see anything in this review that hasn't been said a hundred times.I used my Girlfriend's Ipad 2 quite a bit but, I like this TAB allot more. It's smaller and allot less awkward in your hands than an Ipad. The speakers are allot more clear and louder than the Ipad 2.ProsExpandable memoryAndroidgood speakersoutstanding battery lifeuniversal remoteConsThe screen rotation is't as fast as IpadAndroid app selection is horrid compared to the Istore.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased the Samsugn Galaxy Tab 2 for my 12 yr old grandson for his birthday. He said he needed it for school - he uses it in language arts and also science class. He also enjoys playing games - the interactive voice feature is fun for him.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This android tablet is very fast and easy to use. The choices of applications are more broad than e-readers, but is around the same price. I love it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was trying to find the Perfect tablet UNDER $200. So i did some research and it was going to be a decision between the ideapad and the galaxy tab 2. All the reviews speak for themselves.As a Kindle Fire owner(non-HD), I do not like the kindle because it does not have as much features as the Galaxy Tab 2(i.e. bluetooth, speakers, camera, sd card, to name a few.) i see that the new kindle has some of these features but the galaxy still seems like a better choice. I will be buying myself one of these Galaxy tab 2's after the holidays are over.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I love it I use it everyday at work no lag whatsoever great for watching movies and playing games for the value at 200 bucks its great I use up alot of memory so this device has expandable memory unlike the overhyped nexus 7 now the bad with firmware jellybean being out it seems this device wont get an update and adobe flash 9.1 wont upgrade to flash 10 somewhat minor but it still doesnt take away from the fun this tablet brings great sound great customization another great product by samsung
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've seen many tabs thus far but this little baby does it all one of the best 7 inche tabs on the market! One can't go wrong when it comes to Samsung products regardless of what it is.... AMAZON RULES
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this device a short while ago and i love it!!! It is very smooth between sliding through the pages for most of the time and usually very fast. I am definitely NOT an expert on tablets, but I thought it was a great buy, not to mention a very sharp image with movies and vids. Now for the but...- I wont be raging because it is not that bad but sometimes the device runs really slowly for a while (~5 mins usually for me)- The wifi for my tablet is weird because every once in a while, i have to disconnect wifi and then reconnect to get updates and stuff like that- No folders i think... I like being able to put apps into folders like in apple productsThis all in all would be a perfect 5/5 if it wasn't for these minor things, but still i LOVE IT and would recommend it to anyone!!P.S. sometimes it freezes on the start up of it, but you can either look on youtube or what i learned is to hold the power and volume button at the same time until it unfreezes
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|As time goes on and I learn more about Ice Cream Sandwich and the Samsung, I like theproduct very well. If you get it, immediately go the Samsung's web site and download theOperator's manual. I also got a book from Amazon as well. With out this, I was lost. A smallexample. Nothing in the material that comes with the unit lets you know how long to charge thebattery. It might have been better if I had used Android before, but I hadn't.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I first want to rant a little about the bashers of this product. You should be ashamedof yourselves for being so disingenuose. Many have flat out lied about not being able to add files to the xternal sd card, including movies and other media files, or not being able to off load application data files to an sd card. More lies, stuttering screens, lags, dull screen, bad battery life and the like. I have had this thing for all of 10hrs. Been on it for at least 6 hrs, downloaded photos, imported data files, pdfs, etc to the microsd via, get this wireless ftp software on a SINGLE CHARGE! Online and multitasking. I am not saying this device doesn't have it's flaws. I am saying that to out right lie is wrong. Had i believed the lies I wouldn't be typing this review from the darn thing right now. It does need some tweaking but it is a very satisfying and refreshing product to use2. I have an iPad and apps are great to use, it's very reliable and lasts a dang long time on one charge. But so is this thing. And it's about less than half the weight. As practicle as the iPad my be, it is big and lacksmm?KStop discouraging folks lying for personal reasons. I'm no Android advocate but I'm no apple loyalist just0er give me something that works and I'll use it.Now just a little about the pros and cons. Out of the box it is more samsung than ics. The home screen widgets are etched in stone and the other screens don't have much to offer newbies. I downloaded go launcher ex and some themes until i came across one i liked. All free by the way. Settled in with Cyanogen Iand i am happy with that decision. Certain apps still will notinstall, ie go locker ex nor the associated locker screens but that's astetics. Apps when added install quickly without any fanfare i also have a Chinese tablet called a Cube 17Gt 7 inch and the screen is an ips screen. This tablet is just as bright amd sharp. I watched kungfu panda on both with no perceiveable difference. Apps run well and i am still testing. Be back tomorrow with more on functionality. Meanwhile, haters stop hatin'. A year ago the thing cost almost double the price with less options as far as apps concerned with a few more bells and whistles.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Received this morning (27-Apr) and this device looks awesome, very sleek and the touch feel is so good. Connected to WiFi and browsed thru some apps, need to explore much on the features, so far am loving this device.Update (30-Apr): After using couple of days observed poor battery performance, will check for few more days if any improvement in battery life else will think of returning it, other than this so far this little tab is very nice.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was little disapointed, just becouse of these cons:-Poor battery time, using wifi and programs ramdonly during the day take 1 and 1/2 day to recharge (my fathers iconia take 3 days of use).-A lot of games have slow response, like its a old hardware.-Samsung dont alow to move APPs to external SD card, and 4gb finishes very quick with GPS maps and APPs, mine is already full in 2 days :(-Touch screen is not as precise as Ipad at all.-USB host don't read hi power devices like external hard drive, only pendrive or memory cards.-Get hot on continuous use.-No flash LED-A lot of incompatible Apps for Android 4 (thats google fault)but the Pros:-Good wi-fi signal-Good GPS signal-Light and thin.Samsung took off a lot of quality to make it a low price.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This the second android based tablet that ive purchased and ive been had again. The first though it was used hardbricked afeter three days after I upgraded it to ICE CREAM SANDWHICH with the official site download. This time I buy a brand new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7" 8gb for $179.00 thinking that this was a steal veruses a ipad mini. Yes I am apple biased when it comes to phones but I like android for tablets. Well I just went to the store and picked up a 8gb micro sd card because I already ran out of space. Low and behold the tablet sees it and mounts it but guess what? I cant put anything on it. Not apps not movies not pictures nothing. Its a wasted feature because so far Samsung decided not to support this feature on this tablet. So ive downloaded three diffrent app to sd apps. None work. So I looked on line at support forums. Nothing. So far there is no option to support this feature. So I basically have a breand new 8gb tablet with no more space and a brand new micro sd that isnt even supported by the tablet. Im hoping for a future update for this tablet so that I can move things to the sd. Forgive my ignorance for any one that has over come this issue. This review was written on March 27 2013. So this may not always be an issue. The tablet it self is good build quality and has a nice screen though obviously its no where near retina or hd. Its nice for the price. A good tablet for surfing and Netflix and such. Decent with some games but can chugg with some graphically intensive games even with the memory cleared. I would buy another one of these or even the 10" version if they fix the sd card support. If not then its not worth it if you plan on downloading more than 8gb worth of stuff. I am apple for life and maybe next time I will just save up and get a really nice android tablet or an ipad. For now im very frustrated with the limitaions of android.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Thought I'd up it a little from my Kindle and use the Google supports/apps etc. like my phone has and have the added benefit of the camera. NEVER stays connected to my wireless. Drops out, needs to be constantly reentering my password, cannot pick up a signal and is so FRUSTRATING!!!! My Kindle never does that so i am back to using that as much as possible. WISH i had bought another Kindle. Always losing the signal. NEVER happens with my Kindle can be amywhere in the house. Does have lots of nice features when they work. Camera takes awesome pictures. Don't get one if you want to be on-line :(
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a well-crafted and well-engineered device, but I returned it for a refund because of the following:The navigation function is useless because it is tied to Google Maps, which cannot be used offline (i.e. without an active Internet connection). This is due to a bug, that Google has been aware of for more than a year, which prevents mapping data from being downloaded to the device for offline use.Many of the applications, including the main user interface for the device, include a clause in the user agreement that permits access to ANY AND ALL ACCOUNTS AND FILES stored on the device, and may be used to gather information and to send emails to your contacts "...without your knowledge or consent."
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I originally loved this item, until I realized it wasn't really upgradeable. . The only thing that will go on the 32gb sd card is pictures, you can't save movies to it. You will have room for 1, but when you are traveling you need more than 1. I bought it to be a media device and it really isn't. It needs to have a lot more memory and the description needs to be changed on Amazon's site.I returned it and got a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 with 32GB and I am much happier. I have downloaded 4 HD movies and still have 17gb left. For me it was a much better buy and I am a lot happier with the storage capability.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am happy Amazon is working with me to replace the one I got but I am worried that is has updates on it that made it work so poorly when I received the first one. When I got it the screen did not look like the one they describe and did not have the screenshot icon as shown in all the pictures and video's. I had to tap and then double click everything to get it to open and even then things didn't always open. I also had to use two fingers to get it to scroll up and down or to the next page. After seeing the tutorials and reviews on how it should react I was very disappointed. I talked with Samsung and they were not very helpful. They would tell me to hold the home button and the task manager would open. If I held the home button a voice would come on and tell me to double tap...when I did that and held I only got a google search, not the task manager. Everything they told me it should be doing, it was not!! I sure hope this isn't a change that my replacement will come with. If so it will go back as fast as the last one. I have a Galaxy S3 that I love but the Galaxy Tab 2 I got was very frustrating!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|El producto muy bueno, cumple con todos los requisitos, es original, llego en muy buenas condiciones, cumpliendo con los requisitos de calidad.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I choose this rating due to the fact of still trying to navigate all of the screens and the applications and tryin to get the full use of the tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Purchased this item with one day shipping it took three days! When item was received it was loose in a box to big for unit it didn't have any bubble wrap and one side of box was opened. Thankfully after close inspection of original box it looked okay but was still doubtful about tab inside being damaged. Since this was a gift I didn't want to break factory seal. Well Christmas morning came and tab was OK....but the added stress of maybe receiving a damaged product was not necessary.. I expected more from AMAZON! Especially since they shipped it! 2 Stars for review.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Its ok. The screen is a fine but Ipad minis is better as you dont have to zoom in all the time. Keyboard is small so makes mistakes while typing. Still have to figure out how to chat using messenger and ebuddy. very portable basic tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very satisfied with the tablet. Colors are vibrant and features are excellent. It is a good buy with same features as the more pricey tablets.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I absolutely love my galaxy tab2, only one flaw there is no adobe flash player available for this device. The only disappointment.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|At first I like this little tablet. I do like the size and the processor seems to be quick enough. The original Android build and Samsung software was nice. Half the available storage is taken up and hidden by the Samsung software, but i put in an SD card and since I only bought this to do Android development with the storage was fine. The size is really nice and has made me think that I'd really like the Note II. It's smaller than my iPad and is easy the take off to meetings (unfortunately the poor WiFi renders it useless). The screen looks nice - though not nearly as good as my iPad.However, the WiFi radio on this device is so weak as to be unacceptable. I wrote a Java RTSP library to stream video from IP cameras. When I took this tablet into the office I found that the range limitation was so short I simply could not demonstrate the application unless standing virtually right next to the WiFi router. All other devices had no issues with coverage - iPhones, laptops, iPads, etc.The camera is also of such poor quality that some barcode scanning prototyping I was working on never has worked. In fact while Scanlife can generally scan EZScan codes, other scan software simply won't focus sufficiently to read the "UPC" codes on products. Even "normal" pictures never seem to be in sharp focus.Finally, the touchscreen does not seem to be responsive. I'v found that I have to be very careful with my aim when pressing the menu buttons at the bottom of the screen and it often takes 3 or 4 tries to actually click the button.Overall I'm disappointed with this device. From what I have read this WiFi only version is very cheapened down - people that have the version with 3g say their WiFi works just fine.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Difficult to work around in the system. Can't get programs to close without going to the Task Manager each time, for example. Also I would consider the lack of Flash capability to be an almost fatal flaw. Touch screen way too sensitive, IMO. When trying to scroll through items you often end up activating a link instead of scrolling past it, such as in e-mail.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got the Galaxy Tab2 for Christmas for my husband. It is a great tablet! It would have to be, for my husband since he is a computer nerd! Lol.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got this as a gift it looks nice but it keeps freezing and has other problems i didnt like it
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I use a computer but don't consider myself very knowledgable. My mother has an iPad and can receive a lot of support from Apple throug the Apple store. The same can't be said of the Samsung Galaxy. Once you purchase it you are on your own.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I liked the tablet until it quit working 5 weeks after I received it. It won't turn on at all. I tried holding the start button down for 15 minutes with and without the volume button held down as I have read that may work with this apparent common problem. It didn't. I even ordered and tried another charger to no avail; and the problem began a week after the window closed in order to get full reimbursement for returning to Amazon. With this experience, and now the Texas tax, I probably will no longer order from Amazon.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Aside from all the positives about this device already mentioned, I'm disappointed after owning it since it came out that the following apps that I use on my phone and my previous Tab 10.1 tablet worked but don't work on this tablet: CNN, CVS, and USA Today -- there are others, but these three I use the most often. I had and returned the tab 10.1 because I found that I really needed the extra storage, and that Tab didn't have an sdcard slot, but those apps did work on the 10.1. This tab has the sdcard storage, but the apps I use the most aren't compatible. Yes, you can root and try to change the device name and other tricks to get the Google Playstore to install those "incompatible" apps, but I don't want to take that route. I really don't know why those apps dont work on this tab. I got the amazon app store on the device and kinda rigged getting USA today on this tab by choosing the phone version (and it works fine.) The Google Playstore won't let you install the Phone or Tablet version. If I could do it again, I would've waited for the Tab 2 10.2 w/sdcard or the upcoming Windows Surface Tablet. With that being said, check out the Google Playstore for the apps you'll use first before you buy this to see if they are compatible.

tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung Galaxy Tab is a reliable tablet I can say. The look is sleek, slim, and good looking. The speed is good as long as you do not sart to run multiple apps. The camera is a bit lower quality compared to other tabs but still pretty ok. Now my biggest complaint about this Tab would have to be its responsiveness of from a touch from a sylus or finger. I am not to sure whether Samsung went a cheaper on the screen or screen sensor however that is the what really brings down my opinion of this Tab. Everything else about the Tab is compromisable especially for the great price that you can purchase one for however the lack of response from a touch of either a stylus or finger is enough to make me not want to use it at time.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Anteriormente tuve una tablet Toshiba Thrive de 10 pulgadas. Esta tablet de Samsung es m&aacute;s r&aacute;pida, m&aacute;s fuida, por el tama&ntilde;o evidentemente es m&aacute;s ligera. Entre las dos, me quedo con la de Samsung.

tablet_galaxy_tab|The Samsung tablet had a nice build quality and screen, however, I was unable to download music or books from Amazon because the tablet kept redirecting the browser to the Samsung media store. I could not see or find the PDF files stored on my 32 gig hi-speed micro SD card. I couldn't make the home screen look like I wanted it to. The documentation included in the box was sub-standard - not nearly enough information. I had to go online and locate and download more tech info. Previously, I had an Archos tablet with the older Android OS. I was able to configure the tablet and home screen exactly as I wanted to see it and all my camera manuals were stored and easily accessible in folders on the SD card. It may be possible to do this on the Samsung, but I sure couldn't figure out how and didn't want fiddle with it anymore. The browser redirecting to unwanted URL's was the deciding factor. I sent it back.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my 3rd Android Tablet.BAD: Wifi Drops dramatically if you hold lower left of screen. Ridiculous issue. I am right handed so holding left side just makes sense. You can visually watch the bars drop to nothing when you hold lower left.Wifi reception is not awesome compared to an old iPad, an old iPhone 3GS, and original Nook Color in same location.I am not sure if it is Samsung Touch Wiz, Ice Cream Sandwich or the fact that it is a tablet but I have a big list of apps that don't work. Real Racing, Asphalt 5, Need for Speed Hot pursuit, Reckless Racing FREE, Wave Blazer, Plants Vs Zombies. Most won't open but two open but buttons don't work. I am sure there will be more apps but the list is growing rapidly.Power button is right next to volume. I have shut of tablet about 50 times unintentionally.A number of apps store to the SD card slot (maps and big games) but you can't send any apps there. Space is a big problem already as I can't send apps off of the 6GB over to the 16 I added.Lots of bloat apps that you have to move or delete.Good: Very snappy. Quick in and out of apps. Great feel and size. very LIght. Good but not great battery life. Cameras are tolerable. FIre has NO cameras so it is a big plus to have something. I like the fact that the table is NOT tied completely to good but limited Amazon appstore... but I can still access much of the store. Quick for browsing web.Hopefully some compatibility issues get fixed with some updates.Keeping tablet but very disappointed that the experience is not near as good as what I get from Apple products. If you can find an original iPad for under $300 get it. You will be far ahead and have less headaches to deal with.Very good for reading... completely worth it just for Zinio, Kindle App and Google Books App.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is the best tablet i've used.For the price, the best tablet out there in the market.Everything is very smooth, and you can do whatever you want to make it out of it.peace out, im gonna watch some ____ in Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased the Samsung galaxy tab 2 (7 inch, Wi- Fi)on Amazon in July 2012 and by September it started giving trouble to charge and then it totally stopped charging. Its almost impossible to contact the company especially as I live outside the US. No one is answering the 1 800 number. I suggest you stay away from this product. I have to pay for returning this item.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The item although came as new was already damged, I tried to contact Samsung and they told me it may be fixed if the Tab is reset, I have purchased apps but with the resetting I would loose my money, still if it came new how come is already deffective and there is no guaranty that the re-setting will even fix it. I had no support from manufacturer for a simple task of transfering music files from my computer to the Tab and Play, it only plays if you keep buying and if needs resetting, well touigh luck. Awful Product. misleading advertising, they should stay making tv's not something like this new sandwich os has not mastered yet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really like the tablet , but feel that the screen size is too small. Like to return it and get it bigger.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|After an update from samsung the tablet will not charge while on. I even tried a new charger with no luck. Before the update it was charging just fine while on. Now the red x is there anytime I try. I Googled charging galaxy tab red x and seen that its not just me. No luck with reset as samsung suggested. Still the same problem. Will return ASAP.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I was quite happy with the product until the unit crashed and now i have to exchange it and it is a hassle
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It is a nice tablet I just orderd it few days ago and received on time but I have an issue with total storage it dhiws only 4.49 of total space in the tablet which should be ariund 8 gig as it menyioned on the tablet and specification.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|fantastic but watch out there is no flash player there for its not as useful as you think it will be. it will soon be receiving the jelly bean upgrade as well! .
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It does not have Office suite, it has Polaris Office which you can't create a new blank document from and Polaris Office does not have many of the functions and capabilities of office suite's oft-used softwaresIke Word. The better Office app costs 14.99 so Samsung misrepresents when it says that Office Suite is preloaded, it IS not.Also no USB 1 port so understand that USB 2.0 port means micro USB port meaning you will need a USB reader if you want to hook up an earlier USB device like a storage device to download content from the tab.Other than these two Issues, this is a great machine but having bought and used an iPad I think the IPad is much much better
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I didn't realize I was ordering 8GB GT2 from amazon. I thought it was very cheap at USD179.99 compared to our local sellers which is about USD285.00 but 16GB. It was not mentioned what model it was which can be misleading. I hope amazon can be more specific to avoid misunderstanding. If it was 16GB I sure have saved a lot but since its 8GB I don't think I have any savings.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|thanks thought it was a very good tablet but i got a phablet and now have no use for the tablet
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Dissapointed (I think i expected too muchm as i am SG3 user)Cons- Slugy design- Very heavy than other tablet out there in market- Lots of samsung junk- Android OS not optimized for this perticular device
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have an Ipad 2 and thought that for the 179 price I would explore the Android world. I really had no problem with the minor adustments to this OS. You go to google play, buy or rent movies, buy TV shows etc. Very similar to Itunes. BUT, I sold it because 8gb is not nearly enough to store apps and video. Sure, there is an SD card slot. But, for what purpose? You cannot store apps and copy protected media on your SD card. Songs can be stored but they are not the data usage problem. Songs take little space. I sold the Tab on Craigslist and bought the Nexus 7. WOW! The display is as good as my Ipad and the 16gb built in is plenty for me. They are readily available at Staples, Walmart, etc. I really love this little Nexus for 199! Ipad mini will be 329!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I got my tab 2 for the sole purpose of taking credit cards at art shows. (yes.. of course I will learn to play games on it though... ) BUT ... I cannot get the tablet to recognize the square when I plug it in. We are doing everything right, I think ... the square works fine on my girlfriend's ipad (using my account with square...) and the headphone jack works (with headphones, that is...)It's very frustrating that I can't get straight answers from Samsung ... and I can't find any real information online either.Any help would be very appreciated.~G

tablet_galaxy_tab|Hello I wonder if this tablet is to place it in Spanish, because I want to buy one for my personal use but I need to have the language in SPANISH... thanks.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|good morning , the item is damage, i need you change the item for a new and good item. thaks
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It does everything pretty well. But the really unusual thing - and I did not think to even check, as it seems like such a common-sense thing - it does not have a USB slot, or micro-SD card slot. Yea - strange I know. I guess I just assumed everything (except my Nokia Lumia) has slot space to insert a flash drive or micro SD card. But NO it does not. You have to download everything, or you can connect the device to your computer with the USB cord. So - I would probably buy it again - but that is a pretty significant oversight for a current tech product.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|wifi not good at all cant get a signal and when i do get one it drops/ very poor!!!! other then that its grrt... need to improve..
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet has very poor wifi service and it is hard for me to access the wifi. Nevertheless I cannot enjoy my applications (such as Instagram) without interruptions for the device.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 few month ago for e-mail, Skype and internet surf and GPS when away from home. It was worked good until couple of months ago. I noticed when the unit displays picture, Half of the screen( in landscape) the picture looks horrible. Now I am sending the unit back for repair.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Galaxy is sharp and has great screen quality. But I find that it doesnt catch the wireless signal very well, and Im not able to find a way to fix this on the settings. I'm not given many options through the settings, if they're there, its very difficult to find. I bought it for my 11 year old son, and havent yet found a way to control what is downloaded. We've had it for a month at the most, and I just shipped it off to the Samsung repair center yesterday because it appears the sound card has gone out. And this happened only 2 weeks after having it. Was expecting more out of this tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Just wanted to let everyone know that the manual is available on the Samsung website, it was posted 26 April.I don't have this thing yet, ordered it today. As a newbie in the tablet area I ordered the Tab 2 on the strength of the reviews, thanks for those, I'll post a review of my own once I get mine and use it some. Oh, BTW, I left the purchased at Amazon checked since I ordered it from here.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I had high hopes for this device but, after using it for almost a month now, I am returning it because, to say the least, it simply fails to perform.I don't know whether it's ICS or, maybe I've got some faulty hardware (though, I doubt the latter)? However, the device, for me, has been CONSTANTLY plagued with performance/memory issues! I hardly ever even keep the WIFI running or the browser open, and kill any/all apps as soon as I'm done with them. Nonetheless, this thing is slow as hell! Typically, I use it for very light tasks, such as, using the stock, Samsung music app, and/or reading via the Kindle app. These two get the most use, by far. Regardless, should I try and run another app, (for a total of 2 apps!!!) simultaneously, the device lags tremendously. It becomes painstakingly slow for me to even swipe to the next screen, much less anything with the least amount of complexity. The device has also made random crashes/restarts.FWIW, I did install the update (for whatever, ICS or Samsung OS) immediately upon release, which did nothing regarding my experience. I even followed some advice I found on forums pertaining to adjustments in the Settings under Developer Options, which also made no difference.It has been a highly frustrating experience because I want so much for this thing to work. The size, for me, would be perfect, able to fit right into my back pocket.Other notes:-I also find the keyboard pretty awful, and the cursor to have a mind of its own when trying to edit text, etc. I did install Thumb Keyboard, which was a major improvement, though I still had the cursor issues to deal with.-Battery life could certainly be better, as it struggles to go a day with only the display on, running a simple app like Kindle, and no WIFI.-The speakers suck compared to those in my Samsung Galaxy SII (Skyrocket).Beware:-The 7" form factor! I wasn't aware beforehand that I couldn't run all the apps I do on my phone on this device; another downer.-I also didn't realize I'd need to buy all new cables/adapters for this device after having bought them all for my phone: HDMI, USB female, etc. The cable used here is not a mini-USB as I had anticipated. I only mention as a Caveat Emptor, as this was the least of my concerns; I'd have been happy to buy all new cables had this device lived up to the performance my phone offers at half the size.Should I tempt/convince myself to try another one to see if, in fact, my hardware was possibly faulty, I will obviously change my review. I have been reading over all the reviews here on Amazon, however, and most of the positive reviews, I find to be short and sweet, and without having spent much time actually using the product, i.e., posted after a single day of use! It seems they may not have given the device a proper test period or, are still just so happy to have joined the Tab Club for an affordable price, that perhaps they are overlooking its shortcomings? Hell, I was too, quite ready and willing to compromise for a time....
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Its a kindle fire that you don't have to root to put Android 4.0 on...it comes with ICS!Hardware speaks for itself, its a about what you'd expect from a $250 tablet.Only complaint is Samsung's proprietary UI "enhancements." Just throw stock ICS on there and be done with it, why spend money making something worse, I don't get it. Still its a 5 star device. No real complaints.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this item knowing it was not like an iPad. Enjoyed using various apps. One day, took a photo outdoors. Camera froze and failed! and never worked again for any outdoor pics. Just took a blank grey screen. Called Samsung and was told to send it back for repair and I had to factory reset the product. Two weeks later, I receive a message from them saying that I would be getting a new replacement, but no explanation why the problem happened and why it wouldn't happen again! So, I got a refund instead, as I was very bummed that I lost everything that I had input in the downloaded apps. Not even a full two months is all that tablet lasted. For $250, that's not good enough for me!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|After using the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 for about two weeks, I have decided to return it. I was at first really impressed by its build quality (very solid construction), speed of web browsing, and very agile response when using web applications. Oh, and it is also Made in South Korea (at least mine says), thus an original, pretty much like buying a Sony that is made in Japan, a BMW made in Germany, a Victorinox multi-tool made in Switzerland, or Oakley sunglasses made here in the U.S. of A. On top of that I was hopeful that its TI OMAP 4430 Dual Core 1Ghz processor, which is arguably stronger than the NVdia Tegra 2 (in some benchmark sub-tests the 4430 comes close to even the Tegra 3), would guarantee stability and efficient multi-tasking. I guess I raised my expectations too much. What made me decide to return is, for one, its (very) poor battery life which lasts me only about an hour of web browsing, watching video, listening to music, and playing games. Seriously, just under one hour! Also, what I am equally disappointed in is the all-too-frequent freeze-ups, hangups, and crashes of apps, offline and online. Even my eight-year old Centrino and XP-run laptop doesnt crash as much. My brother also owned a Galaxy Tab 2 for a month, returned his after experiencing the SAME issues I had (i.e. bad battery and crashes among others), but I still thought he got a bum unit then and still bought myself one, which I now realize was a mistake. Perhaps it's the device, perhaps the Android Ice Cream Sandwich, perhaps it's the general architecture, I would not not know.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this tablet two months ago from Costco and recently returned it. I was not satisfied with the tablet and I wouldn't recommend it to you, either.At first the tablet was amazing! The screen is very clear and fun to watch videos on in dark places. I was able to search the internet much faster than my iPhone and Skyping with friends was much easier on the tablet than my laptop. I thought it was a great buy because I do a lot of traveling and could use an electronic device that is lightweight and can handle light usage, such as surfing the net, checking email, Skype, etc.However, my biggest gripe (and the one that made me return the tablet) is how often it freezes and slows down. Even with only one application open, the tablet will eventually slow down until there is a 2 or 3 second delay between each letter I type and when it appears on the screen. If I was IMing a friend on GChat, the tablet would lag like this only ~10 minutes after the conversation began. The Internet froze ALL THE TIME.Also, the glossy screen is a pain if you are trying to watch anything when there is ANY glare. The screen is so glossy that it works like a mirror, more so than the iPhone or iPad screen I believe. It is a pain trying to watch movies if there is any type of light. The touchscreen is not very sensitive as well, which made surfing the internet frustrating. If buttons are close together on the screen, forget about trying to click one properly. The tablet can't differentiate between buttons closer than about 1/2 a centimeter apart, so you'll have to zoom in. Even my iPhone 3 has a more sensitive touch screen, which I thought was a little ridiculous as the Samsung is much newer technology.This may be a personal preference, but I don't believe the home screen is intuitive at all. There are 4 apps on the bottom that you can switch in and out, but I used way more than 4 apps on the tablet for the pure fact that it is a tablet - you can use it for a much wider range of applications than you can a phone (which also has 4 apps on the home screen). If you want to see all the apps you have to click/swipe through a couple more times to see the entire app inventory, and when you want to quit an app it isn't as easy as swiping the app out of the "what apps are running right now" pop up log. Even if you swipe it out, and you can't access it anymore, it still runs in the background for some reason. The fact that it was so difficult to properly quit an application bothered me a lot. I thought the tablet's software was very poorly designed because it took too many click-throughs to get to windows that you needed.Another issue is many video-streaming sites are not supported by Android or make you pay for the mobile version, such as Hulu.I use both PCs and Macs. Don't get me wrong, Apple's iPad has its own issues (I actually returned an iPad 2 as well), but the one thing I hate about PCs is how difficult it makes everything. Something has to freeze, not run properly, shut down on you, or get a virus. The Samsung Galaxy is in the same vein.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Got one from PC Richard but turn out camera not working and unable to watch stream movies from youtube or Netflix, returned to the store for a new one and it work just fine. Love the new android 4.0 OS that came with. But if you compare to Ipad, of course the Ipad is much more smooth. But it is only half the price and work almost the same. I got 2 Ipad at home and wanted a smaller size and this is just prefect. I didn't want to wait for the mini Ipad because not sure if that really coming.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've been looking for affordable tablet for a while. Trying to justify the purchase of one, but this price is right. My laptop is too heavy and cell phone too small. A great go between my pcs and cell phone. Hopefully I will receive my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 tomorrow. Based on the reviews I've read I'd figured I better pull the trigger. USB port a plus. I'm holding off on giving it 4 or more stars until I get a chance to test it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very very nice piece of hardware. Best non-Apple tablet I've tried so far, and the first Android tablet I've actually liked well enough to hang onto. Great performance and quite stable. Form factor is perfect.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very good product ,fast delivery, easy to take anywhere, compact item, you can downlowd anything and trasfer any documents, games, music and movies enjoy,,,
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Excellent Tablet for the price. As with anything there are pros and cons. while I prefer my wife's Kindle Fire, expandable memory is definitely a plus. Wifi is spotty. Some apps won't read the external sd. Still, a relatively solid tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Unfortunately anyone considering this device should Google-search the term "Issue 36993: wifi no longer working in ics 4.0.4 " or simply "galaxy wifi authentication failed". Essentially at this time you may find yourself without any option to connect to the internet. In other words, a pretty useless paper weight.The various forums have several threads on the topic where users, including IT professionals, who own android devices are reporting the problem and not finding a solution or work around. Typical posts from the above read:* "just signed a 2 year contract. Had I known about this issue I never would have committed my two years to this device. Now Im stuck."* "I am too extremely frustrated that for $700 i have a piece of plastic doing a half job... simply unaccceptable. Google needs to push some kind of update ASAP and start treating the android project seriously..."* "Huge problem!!!! Bought 2 galaxy 3's and a galaxy tab 10.1 2 all with no ability to connect WiFi!! This is unacceptable!!!"A bug in Android, introduced in v4.0.4 and persisiting through the latest Android v4.1.2, prevents android devices from connecting to many, mainstream, wifi routers. If your home/office router is one of those, tough luck. Users have these routers working fine with all non-android devices (ie iOS, Windows...). Also, many Galaxy devices (including mine) worked fine up to the v4.0.4 upgrade.Personally I had been an advocate of the Samsung Google product family. However the lack of networking functionality, and lack of communication by these companies in the several months of this issue persisting should be unacceptable and potential consumers here should be aware and beware.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this 7inch tablet for use as a student in medical clinical settings and of course during leisure time as well. I purchased this based on my satisfaction of other Samsung products and my liking of their original 10.1 tablet. I won't make this too lengthy and will get right to the point, starting with a list of pro's and con's.Pros-Expandable memory (up to 32gb)-Icecream sandwich OS (Soon to be outdated, see below)-IR Port-Front and rear camera-Good WiFi receptionCons-My biggest issue with this tablet was the screen and I noticed this on all units I have been able to take a look at. The color calibration on this is EXTREMELY below Samsung standards. This was the worst screen I have ever witnessed on a Samsung product. When compared to the Kindle Fire and other tablets in this tier,the biggest thing I noted was the galaxy tab's whites are more of a cream and have a dirty look. It's possible this may be corrected in an update in the future but as for now, how did this ever make it to the consumer market?!?!-Icecream Sandwich will soon be outdated by Jellybean. I have had 4 other Samsung Android devices and they are notoriously slow getting Android updates out. Feel free to look this up if you don't believe me, it's a fact.-Also because it is Samsung, you do not get the full Android experience but instead you will get it mixed with their Touchwiz software. I have found this to have a very negative impact on the performance of this tablet and more often than not, just gets in the way.-The iconic Icecream Sandwich face unlock feature that was so advertised with the OS release? You won't find that it on this tablet because Samsung doesn't support it.-The IR port does not have a paired Samsung application to run it. Instead you will be directed to install the Peel Reel app to make use of it. It is one of extremely few apps that can make it work. Peel Reel is somewhat buggy and requires an internet connection to use (you can see it's reviews in the Google Play Store, will improve over time I am sure). I found that it works well on Sony and Dynex televisions, but for some reason it just couldn't master an LG flat screen. Something for Peel Reel to work on, but why no Samsung App to support this?!?!-I put the cameras in PRO because they are included unlike some other tablets, but their quality limits their usefulness. You will be able to video chat, but be prepared to look pixelated.-I mentioned performance before, but I wanted to throw in about requiring restarts too. I thought we had moved away from the tech limitation of having to restart a device to clear tasks, RAM, etc. but apparently not. When you turn on the tab you may be able to play a graphic intense game or an equivalent on this tab, but later in your session, you will see some lag times on it without a restart. Samsung includes it's own task manager but it does not clear up the lag with extended use.-The touch sensitivity needs to be stronger and their is no option to increase this, expect a few double taps along the way.At the time of this tablets release this is the most superior 7inch tablet and easily kills the Kindle Fire in performance. However based on the issues stated above, I recently sold my Galaxy Tab 2 7in. and pre-ordered the upcoming Galaxy Nexus 7. I will not go into it's specs on this review, but I would encourage everyone looking to get into the 7inch tablet field to give a look at the Nexus 7 or wait on the next generation of the Kindle Fire. The Galaxy Tab 2 7in. just isn't worth it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is my 1st tablet and I have not played with others. I can only base this review against my HTC Thunderbolt phone.I bought this tablet to have a bigger screen to navigate email and web with similar or better performance. This has not been achieved for the most part. It is faster loading web pages but that's about it. I've had way too many missed or non responding taps navigating around or using the keyboard. Keyboard only does spelling suggestions and not auto spelling or grammar corrections. Verified with samsung that when you go to delete emails by selecting "delete all" it will still delete them one by one. You will have to do this twice. Once from inbox and once from trash so plan on a couple of minutes for around 100 emails. Instantaneous on my thunderbolt in a second or 2. If you're more worried about all the other apps and features then I suppose you'll be ok. I would play with it in the store 1st. I'll be returning and trying something else. Another thing, even though I deleted my sent emails it still shows that i have sent emails on it's icon. Tap the icon and there are no sent emails. I've deleted cache, data, and account and started over to no avail. I have not tried a factory reset but samsung confirmed it's performance of the email app. Maybe others are not experiencing this problem with the email app or it's not an issue to them. The missed or non responding taps and email issues are enough for me. I think a tablet needs to do the main things well and to me that is email and web. Not achieved. Missed on thing to report. Even though you delete your emails from inbox and trash it will bring them back. Say you have some emails in there and you scroll down to the oldest one. You will notice the little syncing animation starting and your deleted emails coming back.Edit 5-16-12: Adding a star back after a reviewer suggested I use "Hackers Keyboard" app to replace stock. I now have a usable keyboard that I'm much more comfortable with. I still have to do multiple taps or taps with force to get some links to respond and the stock email app is my only real issues with this tablet now. May try a reset to see if I can get better screen response.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Love it, this is exactly what I wanted. Thanks!!!!! :-)La lla la la la la to complete the words requirements, totally stupid.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I like the tab...its a decent upgrade, size wise, for my phone when surfing the net and playin games. The problem that I have is that it seems that the processor seems slower than the one on my phone. I also have thought on occasion that maybe I should have bought the full size one. Again I do like it as do my kids but I expected a little more.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've owned this tablet for less than three months and it is completely dead. Won't charge, won't power up ... nothing. It was not dropped or mistreated. It just died. I'm really ticked because all of my homework is on this tablet. I will never buy another Samsung product. I'm also done with Amazon. There is no warranty offered on this product except DOA. Amazon has lost a regular customer.

tablet_galaxy_tab|worked good for 2 1/2 months then failed to take a charge, more than likely a charger problem, warranty is one year, now the pain in the rear starts, could not find a phone number to get the problem fixed under warranty, go on line, two days about 5 hours total typing to a live chat? ran thru all the supossenly fixs and tests, nothing, asked for a phone number, ignored instead send me to a link on the site to type the ser num and model number, rejects it 5 or 6 times, now I am getting hot, finaly the 3 chat person I am cussing and I had another one ordered from amazon and while typeing to there live help chat I went to my orders from amazon and canceled the second tablet, They hadn't shipped it yet and canceled it for me, I would not go thru this again with another tablet from samsung if it stopped working.Turns out the first 2 chat people could have did it for me, 3rd person did the typeing that I couldn't get to except my info, why the first didn't I have no Idea.shorten the story, I am suppossed to get a call in 2 to 3 days. If you have to do warranty with samsung and you use that chat I advise you to tell what the problem is and ignore any sugestions they give and just repeat I want to talk to some one on the phone or you will be like me 5 hours on chat and getting no where like me.there warranty chat sucks, I told them most people would just get wore out and they would quit so samsung would win, no warranty work for them, they are the worst I have ever delt with.The last chat person said if we can't fix it would I except a reconditioned one, are they crazy, I bought new because it would be safe, I buy a new one and they want to give me a used one.terrible company to get warranty work.Never again will I buy any thing that has the samsung name on it, won't take a chance on it quit working and go thru that run around on a computora 2 or 3 dollar there cost probably would have fixed the problem, chager doesn't have a light on to tell if it is working, wasn't warm to the touch like all wall warts so I am pretty sure its the chargerhad a slight problem with a crossman pellet gun and got a live person and it was out of warranty and just wanted them to know, seven days later a new one was at my door and a shipping label prepaid to send the old one back, now I have 6 of their productsmar 20 2013well I ordered a replacement cord from amazon and it got here in 4 days, Problem fixed, cord was bad that go's in the charger, samsung said they would call in 2 days, Haven't yet and amazon can get me a new cord in 4 days, told them I was almost positive it was the cord because the charger was putting out 4.5 volts but wasn't getting thru the wire.the tablet works good just pray that you don't need warrenty work.never any samsung products again for me , they will not do the warranty work then on that live chat asked me if i would except a refurbised one, hell no, I didn't buy a used one,Did I say how I dislike samsung

tablet_galaxy_tab|Good product feature and performance wise. More good than bad.However it gets 4 stars because:1 - It comes with 768Mb of RAM and not 1Gig as described by amazon. They never said 1G of ram on the box so I can't fault Samsung. Perhaps I received the wrong model? I don't think so because everything else checks out. As with any computer for heaven's sake don't scrimp on the RAM!2 - As of 2012-12-05 I have not found a way to install apps to the memory card. Google's fault. Fix it Google.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I didn't think I would enjoy the Samsung as much as I do... It is one of the easiest products to learn to usenot complicated , simple and with the help of Amazon Kindle Androids... I am able to download books, games andinformation as needed.... would recommend it to all, for it is in my opinion easier to use than the Kindle fire..

tablet_galaxy_tab|The samsung galaxy tab 2( 7 inch Wifi is portable n easy to carry. Its okay but has battery problem.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The WiFi signal strength is terrible. Just like other reviews if you hold it in the bottom left corner the signal drops 90% even in the same room with the router. I have two routers linked and I can get a half a block away with my iPhone before the WiFi cuts out. So if you are left handed or don't use the Internet I would say it was just about perfect.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|If you are in my situation and have no wi-fi or internet when you are working you would choose a Tablet with expandable memory, but if you are in a wi-fi area all day you have more options, like nexus 7 tablet.Compre una galaxy tab 2 luego de evaluar un buen rato mis necesidades y las condiciones en las que la iba a utilizar, eleji esta por no contar con conexi&oacute;n wi-fi frecuente debido a mi trabajo y por razones de shipping decid&iacute; comprarla en Datavision. El servicio fue excelente entregada a tiempo y justo lo que ordene. No me puedo quejar de nada.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm a real sucker for gadgets, and I was intrigued by this tablet, but at every turn there was a new struggle to make this thing work. I finally, after about 8 hours, did get everything except bluetooth to work, but it doesn't work as well as my cheapo LG Optimus. Already, after only one day, and NO new apps installed, it's become slow, and lost it's smooth action. Yes, I killed all the unnecessary apps. Apart from the large, very nice screen, I'd rather use my old Optimus for everything. And the part about using it as a universal remote, well all I can say is why did they put that ability/app center stage when it's getting 214 one star ratings out of 570? More one stars than 5 stars!Really Samsung, you should make your "smart" devices a whole lot smarter.Took Tab 2 back and got Nexus 7. Much faster and smoother. Happy now.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm very satisfied with my Tablet, but unfortunately the Detachable Travel Charger (ETA-P10JBEGSTA) its NOT WORKING AT ALL !!!I think amazon should send me a new charger for free, in order to replace the faulty one !!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is an attractive and seemingly well made product, although the packaging is cheap looking.We bought this tablet for primary use as a remote control. The tablet is excellent, but the wifi connection to our home router, required by the remote control app, will not reconnect after a reboot, until we reset the router. This happens EVERY time, and we have had no luck fixing it.By contrast, we also have a TouchSquid TS-781, which has no such issues, connects to the wi-fi reliably at all times. It doesn't actually need the wifi for remote duty but the app does have browsing capabilities. It cost more than the Samsung but so far is more reliable because of this issue.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a perfect size of tablet which is a my first tablet as 7' size.I had ordered at Amazon 3days ago and I got today as fresh brand new galaxy tab.The below is the initial impression from quick usages.1. Internet browsing speed: yes, you cannot tell whether the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is fast or not because it is matter with network connection speed with your service provider.However, I have Ipad 1, IPad2, and viewsonic g-tablet 10' which can easily compare the speed among them. The time is not measured but comparing loading speed of media contents such as flash. Yes, I can feel the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0' is little bit faster, But it might be the size of screen that is smaller than other tablet. I will add more detail measurement soon.2.Read more reviews at damoastore.com or techsmart.info

tablet_galaxy_tab|Due to yesterday's market reconfiguration and reorientation, this product now has a serious competitor and it is only a matter of hours before this drops to the sub one hundred dollar range. Yes, I am talking about that Mountain View NSA-spy company's new Nexus 7. The memory expansion, slightly larger screen, etc., but trust me it won't hold up, not by a longshot. Galaxy loses on penalty kicks, will not advance.

tablet_galaxy_tab|The galaxy tab 2 7 inch looked promising coming out of the package. The design was solid, but for some reason it does not feel stable in my hand and I am constantly worried about dropping it. This is probably because this is my first tablet. I'm sure some sort of protective case will make me feel more at ease. The screen is very responsive and the internet pages open quickly. Other than that, there is little else I can offer because SAMSUNG HAS NO MANUAL AVAILABLE ONLINE!!! Customer service is very important these days, and I find no manual EXTREMELY aggravating! Fortunately,I am fairly computer savvy and can navigate most devices without a manual. Most of the time,a manual is an afterthought. I'm sure that someone will fix this problem and my experience will get better, but for now, it bothers me that someone got paid a lot of money to screw this up. After all the positive things I have read about Samsung, I expected better.Updated review: OK, for all of you that complained that I did not write a review (actually it was a review of Samsung support more than anything else). First, there is still no online manual accessible from the device itself unless you use the "full site option" hidden in the fine print at the bottom of the Samsung mobile homepage. People who are "computer savvy" will be able to figure that out, but honestly, this device isn't for your hardcore user and my wife or 15yo son might have a problem figuring that out. That's who this device is tailored for, the new user who only wants to spend $249, not people like Kenneth J. Conner, Carl E. Simms, or myself, who have the ability to assemble our own computer's from scratch. I DID contact Samsung customer support who told me that there was no manual available at the time; now there is, but again, only through the full site.The device works as expected. The screen is vibrant and great for watching movies. The screen is generally responsive, which is expected as well. I have noticed that when you need to tap something small, such as an "x" to close an internet screen, it requires multiple taps and becomes frustrating. Some people have complained about google's integration into the android system; I find far less clutter and better functionality than the extra's that are integrated into my Verizon phone by Motorola. The charging/USB cord is a little annoying as well. I find the shape of the male plug for the device unnecessary and unfriendly. If I lose it, break it, step on it, etc, I am forced to buy another from samsung instead of being able to use one of the 6 or 7 mini/micro USBs that I already own. The camara is ok if you have light (no flash), but I don't think many people take pictures with a tablet, so it's a non-issue. The power button is fairly sensitive and I have a habit of pressing it by mistake. Again, trivial, just move your hand.To wrap up, it does what it's expected to...no more, no less. It doesn't "wow" me. My phone's a better device, but it costs more and has more competition. Am I glad I bought it? Not really. Is it bad enough to send back? Not really. Will I put it to good use? Sure. Would I recommend it? I would probably tell someone to wait for another device to come out. If the Blackberry Playbook had an expansion slot, I would get that instead (got one and returned it because I needed more space).

tablet_galaxy_tab|Although it is advertised for the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0, it was never made for it. There is no access to the headphone jack....so you have to cut a hole in the case to use them. The sensor that monitors ambient light is covered by the case, so no auto control for the display. As such, you have to cut a chunk out of the case. The IR port is covered by the case....you guessed it, cut another hole in the case for the IR sensor to work. There is no access hole in the case for the camera lens....so you can't take a photo without removing it from the case....or cut another hole in the case. Basically, this is a piece of junk repackaged for use on a model it was never intended for.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This means yet another cable to carry around and if you loose it, you can't just use another standard USB cable lying around and you may be stuck for a while. I have been using Samsung Galaxy Player 4 for several months and I'm very happy with it, and it uses standard USB cable.I played around with this Galaxy Tab 2 for a good 15 minutes or more at BestBuy and everything is great and was planning on buying it in a few days, but this proprietary crap means I'm likely going to hold off buying and wait for the rumored Google/ASUS tablet that's comparable to this Galaxy Tab 2 in spec and price, maybe cheaper, hopefully that will use standard USB cable.I stopped buying Sony products because of their proprietary memory sticks and I hope Samsung does not go that route.I found out about this proprietary USB cable from forbes.com
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I received this tablet and almost right away it started malfunctioning. Within 3 or 4 hours the screen froze at least 7 times. When the screen wasnt freezing, it would power itself down. I do not want a replacement and will not buy another tablet. I will stick to my laptop and smart phone.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The fact that this tablet did not have Flash Player or any other video software rendered it useless for many web sites,other than that major fault it was ok....a good e-reader.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Cant hear the sound on it that well.something must be wrong with it. Uuu uuu uuu uuu uuu uu uuu
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The price advertised was $179.00 for a 16 GB. When it came it was an 8 GB which was not what I ordered. lI live in the caribbean and it will be difficult to return it. I would have liked to receive the difference of my cash but does not know how possible that is.

---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a pretty good tablet for the money and all the features. The reason why I'm writing this review is to complain about the screen. It's not too good. Coming from using the iPhone 4 I was a bit frustrated with the quality of the screen. Low resolution combined with a clunky layout it's not very pleasant to use. At the very least the screen is not very sensitive to touch...you really have to press with your fingers. If the smoothness of the screen is not worth the extra 100 bucks then go with this one.

tablet_galaxy_tab|My new samsung galaxy tab 2 ejects the micro sd memory card. I can't use the micro sd memory card
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I recently bought 2 7inch tabs for my 2-year old twin girls!It is perfect for them, easy to handle and kid-friendly!!!You can download all kinds of educational apps..I would recommend it to other parents!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Great features with one exception and that one is a deal breaker.The SD Card on this device cannot be used. The tablet even fools you into thinking you are saving to the SD chip by emulating a SD drive. The so called 8 gigs is really only about 4 becuse it loads up a bunch of useless apps that you cant delete.Im returning mine today and its too bad because I really enjoyed the size of the device until I ran out of memory.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Me gusta esta tableta aunque solo es para usar con WIFI, es muy rapida , la calidad de video es muy buena!! y el precio mucho mejor
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|this is a christmas gift so i cannot rate the product at this time. i can say it arrived quickly, it was packaged efficiently, and from the description on the box, it will be exactly what my grandson asked for. the price for the size was very reasonable. i decided not to get an ipad as you are restricted to downloading apple products only. with the samsung, my grandson will be able to use apps through google, and download music from other sites. i am not sure what else this product is supposed to do, but am looking forward to his satisfaction on christmas day!

tablet_galaxy_tab|What do you give an 18 year old who only wants cash for his big birthday? The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2! He loves it, can't put it down and I hope it will help him in college next year. I am very happy with this purchase because it arrived far ahead of his birthday, he's thrilled with it and didn't even know he wanted/needed a tablet. Awesome! Thank you.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It is excellent, I recommend it. Alone should make clear that you can use as a phone, not everyone knows the technology
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|When I recieved this tab I loved it! It did everything I wanted and at a great price. But now that I have had it a while problems are starting to show themselves. First of all updates take forever and use up much battery power. Secondly I am not able to acces my email anymore. I have tried everything I can to regain that access to no good. Is it a matter of you get what you pay for? My email was one of the biggest reasons I bought this tab and if I can`t resolve this soon it is no better than a paper weight for 268 dollars! So buy with caution.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Bought this and never had a problem. But beware, it says a 8 gig hard drive but after looking I seen I had almost filled it up. It seems I only have a 4 gig hard drive. It says 8 on the tablet and upon the box but in the settings I only have 4. So look close at it when you get it home.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This has been an excellent teaching tool that I use in the classroom. The Galaxy is my first ever tablet but I do wish I would have purchased an iPad instead.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought a the tab 2 right before I left on a month long trip to Europe. That said, I am now stuck with this piece of junk as my return option expired while I was out of the country. The problem is that the thing has serious wifi connection issues. If you do you diligence you will find this is a very, very common problem. Often people will say to reset your router as a fix. My reply to that crazy idea is this is a mobile device, and we don't have access to the many routers offering us wifi signals on the go. Not to mention that other devices have no issues connecting at those locations. It is very frustrating to have a strong signal yet have my tab constantly cycling for a connection. Without wifi its nothing more than a reader or gamepad. I strongly advise people to stay away from this product.I have tried using various wifi fix apps, rebooting my tab, turning off the wifi and restarting it, still the same connectivity issues. Sometimes it will connect and very often it won't.Bad quality.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Get the Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus refurbished from here... it's more powerful, the camera is way better and its just a better device.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I had intended to postpone this till Christmas but was concerned about the condition of the shipping box. Ordered more than 1. Fortunately, all is well. Even after family member dropped said Tab2 on the bare carpet that prompted early test drive.O.K., This thing needs more documentation. Not only that, most of the applications for the Tab2 have to be downloaded from Google play. Because I did not want to use a credit card unlike Apple who insists upon it, everything I downloaded is from the free section which was actually a relief to find that everything works.Compared to my Apple ipodTouch 4th generation, the applications for Tab2 seem better and more comprehensive. Again, the Tab2 came with little to begin with. At least the ipod came with a working camera, maps,and other app.'s already stored on device.Size wise, ipod is the way to go but can't play netflix or hulu. Tab2 does not fit in pocket. External SD storage needs explaining. Not intuitive.Because I have only been messing around with it for the last 3 days, I will probably have a better opinion as time goes on.Funny how Apple is trying to crash the party. Were'nt they the ones who had a pirate flag waving over their headquarters and adopted said practices?

tablet_galaxy_tab|the ice cream sandwich operating system is pretty cool. the 2.0 tablet is lighter and thinner which I like. I purchased the 1.0 for about $500 dollars a few years ago and although I didn't use it a lot, it was a good machine, but I have computers everywhere I hang out. I liked the $250 price of the 2.0. I use it a little more, but really could have saved my $250 or tried a Kindle WiFI for about the same money and had something a little more different than what I had. I'll let you know if I really use the new galaxy more. OH the old machine had 3G hook-up, but since I didn't use it a lot I wasted quite a few dollars on the 3G thingy. I figure I can get a good 3G to wifi hot spot if I find a need to mobilize. BTW if my review doesnt seem to warrant 5 stars, I rated it because I think it's a great little machine, just not in my circumstances.

tablet_galaxy_tab|my name is WILMER RIVAS They offer an 8GB Internal Memory and when the check was only 3.49 gb here
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought it 2 weeks agoIt didn't work well and I wasn't satisfy. The photo quality was not good. The screen did not rotate. Also I had trouble when I wanted to open some websites.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I like the galaxy tab in the first place, but I like the first series better, to me it prossed better. I don't like the screen saver. I have tried to download movies and every format that I have tried hasn't worked. Only two of the movies has made it on to the chip and played,etc..... I liked the first issue better!!!!!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really wanted to like this tablet, but could not. It works only with a Wi-Fi signal, meaning there are many places it won't do anything. Also, the touch screen often fails to respond to touch commands. Two male friends fought with it as well. I thought I might have gotten a faulty one, but trying out a display model in a store got the same lack of results. Thanks to Amazon's return policy, I sent it back and received a refund. This tablet does not live up to the Samsung reputation.

tablet_galaxy_tab|My wife got a Galaxy Tab 2 through a deal at her work. Cool! This seemed like a great device for watching movies and checking email while traveling.After working with it for a while, I absolutely hate it!My expectation was that I would connect the UBS cable to the PC, and I can see the tab directory structure, and move files back and forth. No such luck!To connect with the PC, I needed to install Samsung Kies. Piece of junk! Once in a while I can get the tab to connect via UBS, after several reboots of the PC, but most of the time the computer doesn't ever recognize it. The tab says that it's connected via wi-fi, but there's no indication on the PC that it's connected, and apparently no way to push files over wi-fi to the tab.Mail works, but open wi-fi is so rare that it's not much use.The few times that I got a movie installed they played well (using an external app: MX Player) with good picture quality and adequate sound. My wife hears it ok but I had trouble with the volume sometimes even with noise-cancelling headphones.It mostly lies in a corner gathering dust, until every 3 months or so my wife wants to use it for a short trip. I then fight with it for hours, sometimes getting movies installed, but mostly just getting frustrated by the crappy interface. Then she takes one of the laptops.If you think you can use this device, let me know and I'll sell you this one cheap. Otherwise I might just stamp on it, then go try an iPad.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Just received this today. Advertised to have 8G of memory but only has 4G when I checked the device memory in the storage settings. Sending it back.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Too many tablet makers are still giving us 8 GB of storage, of which half is used by the OS (leaving around 5 to 6 GB for actual usage). For people who download a lot of apps and games, that is not enough. I know the Galaxy Tab (and other devices) use Micro SD cards, but you can't store and load apps on those. Tablets should come with AT LEAST 16 GB standard. Amazon and Apple know this, which is why they offer their tablets (Kindle Fire HD & iPad) in 16 GB and up.Get with the program Samsung!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Small, maybe the 10 is better.still learning the features.Especially the games apps. It an ok tablet. Buy the bigger if you want tablet.

tablet_galaxy_tab|It is a good product from Samsung. Looks great and works great too. The screen looks great and the browsing experience is very fast. This is great for games too. These tablets can be handy helpers, in our day to day lives. I recommend Samsung Galaxy.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Solo le falta 3g, lo dem&aacute;s es muy bonito se ajusta bien a la mano, se ve que es muy fuerte y duradero
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is great in almost every way with one exception. There is no way to copy or move media to the SD card without being connected to a computer. With a 8GB HD there is little room to store anything other than Apps. Very disappointing! Furthermore Kies is not compatible with this product. Otherwise, it could be great.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This samsung won't hold a charge.i own a nook and I don't have to charge it for up to five daysThe galaxy tab goes from 100% power to complete shut downin less than 8 hrs. I will return this product and request a refund

tablet_galaxy_tab|I ordered this on Amazon.com instead of standing in line at Black Friday at Sam's to get it for my husband. I was so excited that I went ahead and ordered him the keyboard case and screen protector as well. Well everything came in and I unwrapped it all to start putting it together and while in the process of setting the tab 2 up, it just flipped out on me. I was trying to tap the English button to set up languages and such and it was like there was an invisible finger pressing something else in the corner of the screen. I powered it down, wiped the screen, Googled the issue and everything and nothing worked to fix the problem so I never got past the set up screens. The screen never would recognize my selections. I emailed Amazon about getting a replacement and starting the return process only to be told, &#34;so sorry&#34; but they were out. And they have been out now every day since I bought it. The only option they say is to return it and get a refund. WTH? I purchased the case and everything for this specific unit and now I don't have one and to buy another one would cost me almost $100 more than I paid so what now I'm just out? This experience has sucked and I won't be buying any electronics off of here again. I will stick to waiting in line at a store where I know I can go and exchange the item when it doesn't work instead of being screwed over with a case and protector that doesn't have anything to fit now! Thanks for ruining my hubby's Christmas!

tablet_galaxy_tab|The true storage of this device is 4.59 GB. It is NOT expandable via SD card. The device does not allow access to the SD card. All apps, games, etc. download automatically to the internal storage and this is limited to 4.5 usable GB. Check the Samsung and Android forums to confirm this. Some apps require up to 2 GB alone. If you require more than 4.5 GB total storage, do NOT purchase this device.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have two serious issues with this tablet:1) Connectivity -- It constantly disconnects from the internet. Even though other devices in the household keep their connection, this does not. It's extremely frustrating.2) Navigation -- Even when the device stays connected, much of the navigation is clunky and requires multiple attempts.I regret this purchase.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|the primary reason to purchase galaxy tab 2.0 was for the 8gb internal memory and when i realized instead i got a 4gb i was not happy at all. this tablet is OK but i feel i had been fooled i did not recieve what i expected for.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Same as the title says. At first, I enjoyed it. Probably it was because I didn't have any tablet before.I am using an iPhone 4 and I have tried using an iPad and a Kindle, so I know what it feels like touching the screens of those machines.And this is my first Android machine and I don't know if it is an Android thing or a Samsung thing honestly, but it was very hard to touch the keyboard and not to make any mistake.So I tried using voice keyboard instead, which was a lot worse than Google's built-in voice search, and it made me soon give up.Well, at this point it was acceptable. I could have adapted.But, because Galaxy Tab 2 uses an OS version (Ice Cream Sandwich) that is not compatible with some of the apps that I wanted to use (e.g., ubersocial), it was frustrating to find that my new tablet won't be as useful as I expected.I was going to accept all the shortcomings because the price was reasonable and I needed a tablet anyway.But it STOPPED WORKING a week after purchase. Yeah. I am returning it.One more thing. Listening to music on this Tab was specifically difficult. I still do not know how to sort the songs. The menu is quite confusing. Not as instinctively easy as iOS devices.Oh, and Adobe Flash Player! It didn't work. The most disappointing thing. It is different from what the advertisement says. Don't be deceived.I didn't feel like 8GB was too small, though. But considering the large screen, you'll probably want to see video on this portable machine (unless you have a bigger tablet) and will get to patronize YouTube more (I did) or may feel like storing as many videos as you like and see it whenever you want. I have WiFi in my home so that was no problem with the Dropbox storage Samsung gave out additionally, although I know it will expire after 1 year.Plus, I liked the weight and the grip. It is not too heavy at all but still gave a relatively good feeling when I grabbed it. Again, if it had not been broken, I would have used it anyway. Too bad.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|an excellent product, own brand, it works very fast and efficient, as it came as it was purchased, that is NEW, I am very satisfied with my purchase
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Loved this unit for the first three weeks it worked, then I turned it on and it would just hang at the Samsung logo during boot up. The unit would not boot into recovery mode so I held in my hand a $250 paper weight! Luckily the store I bought it from was nice enough to let me return it, even though it was outside of their 15 day return policy. This is not the first problem I have had with Samsungs portable electronics products and it will be the last time I purchase a Samsung product.

tablet_galaxy_tab|This product is very misleading and i am very upset. Luckily I can still return it. Just because you can have an sd card slot does not mean you can use it. The sd card only supports music, photos, and videos. YOU CANNOT MOVE APPS TO SD CARD!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I would've known that. The 8 gb device only came with 4 gb after the software and preloaded apps. I literally have 10 apps with no music or photos and its gone. Why can't I move them? You're not apple.. I'm very disappointed that's all! Everything else is awesome and I'm sad to take it back but i cannot even use what it has because of memory..

tablet_galaxy_tab|I ordered the Samsung Galaxy Tablet as a gift to take to a relative in the UK in late June. It was well received, worked when plugged in, but he didn't have the opportunity to use it during my visit. I've returned to the US and have received an email today indicating that there is a problem with the battery - it doesn't hold a charge and runs down quickly even when it has been charged and turned off. We're now past the deadline for returning the defective item. What a disappointment - the whole point of a tablet is that it is mobile but this item , in order to be used, has to be plugged in!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Such a shame,this ia a beautiful device,but the worst problem is its wifi,it is very poor and weak and if you hold it from the bottom left corner you will see how the wifi bars and aignal drop.So don't even bother with this item.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|just bought this table. Amazing! this tablet exceeded my expectation by a ton. the tablets fast, reliable, and at an amazing price. dont miss this deal get one for your self right away. I would recomend this tablet to little boys of the age of 13.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a quick and good tablet.The biggest let down is the SD CARD slot. I called Samsung today and they told me that you are not allowed to transfer any applications or files you download on the tablet over to your SD card. So you are basically stuck with the GB size you purchase.They have no future update for this problem. And they also told me that the SD card slot shouldn't have been placed in the device at all. Basically you are buying the Samsung version of a Kindle Fire. With no Expansion Slot!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i heard this tablet is better than kindle that is the reason I bought this tablet. but I don't see the difference. I luv the kindle more because when I go to school and I use on my lecture. this tab don't have office. that is the only different and amazon prime movies
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I received this four days ago. It wont connect to my home wifi! I called Samsung, went through different ways to connect but not luck. Calle Comcast. was on the phone for 3 hrs! No connection. Went to work, connected in 1 minute! We have verizon fios at work. Are there any Comcast users here who have experienced this? I love this tab and dont want to return it yet. Please help! Thanks.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The tablet worked 2 days and then the touch screen did not work. I am in Venezuela and there is no guarantee inLatinoamerica
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This thing is amazing. Bought my girlfriend am i pad mini. Its more responsive and the battery life is better than the Samsung. Also the screen of the mini is so much brighter and clearer.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It's may be passed compared to rhe newest tablet. Nice choice for thoses who never had any tablet. But compared to my Ipad2, the tablet is not enough power, lot of slow down.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I just purchased this tablet, my first one, and it's not user friendly. Size, touch screen, clarity, price were all good.I need to read the manual a lot more in order to use it without getting frustrated.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Do not buy this product!!For now this is a paperweight my wife purchased it for me thinking it would read my books from barns B & N .com.And going through Google, and Samsung passwords and crap. After 2  hours I still cannot get on the internet to see if it even has apps to read books from Barns and Noble and Amazon. Unless you only want to do word processing using .doc files and serf the internet ( so it says you can and get your email ) which I have not been able to do. Leave this alone. I cannot even find a tech. support number for Samsung for them to help me.To be fair I will quit for now and try again tonight, but this is ridiculous!!! The sales pitch is greater than the product for now.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Purchased this tablet expecting to be able see Flash content (including streaming Amazon Prime videos) If you are purchasing a new Galaxy Tab 2 model number GT P3113 you will be SOL. Not to happy about this since it is a selling point in the product description. Other than that it seems to be good tablet.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I recommend 10 inch model than this. I wish they had good video conferencing front camera. I returning it and getting 10 inch one.Pros:1. open android market.2. expansion micro SDHC slot3. decent screen resolution.4. Voice quality is good.Good and Bad: 7 inch is portable, but document reading is pain, esp PDF or other docs.Bad:Front VGA camera video quality sucks big time.I doubt this is dual-core, performance is not zappy, seems slow.Need minimum 16GB than 8GB, as you can not exceed 8GB of installed apps.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Liked my tablet . Used it several months, only problem was it won't charge with any other usb plug but the Samsung and mine kept falling out. They sent me a new one. NOW they made me update. I could not opt out. The back button in the left bottom corner (same as both my phones) was moved to the middle.A button I constantly and automatically used. Now I have to search for it every time. The screenshot button was taken away. (which is why I bought the tablet) You could take a screenshot AND write on it and mail it all in one move. Now.... you have to hold 2 side buttons. Then load it . Then reload it to a different app to write on it (with less options than was on the original tablet) When I contacted Samsung they said it was a GOOGLE choice and it can't be changed back to the tablet I bought. It is now NOT THE TABLET I BOUGHT. Funny how Google has control of Samsungs tablet . Don't they have a tablet out now. And they control what the Samsung tablet is doing. ODD. They also won't let me change or add to my good review on Samsung. They only allow 1 review. OH. The update took another 1/3 of my storage space. Now they want me to update again and I can't make it go away because they also took away the CLEAR option . Not that it wouldn't just keep popping up. So, it doesn't matter what you buy, or why you buy it, because Samsung can change it into anything they want. The update now wants me to authorize updates. REALLY. Wonder what I can do about the update they did without this authourization. I have checked the option of no automatic updates and it is still asking me to update. So Sad. I talked my brother into buying one of these and it is just past his 30 days to take it back. So so sad.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my wife. She is perplexed and having trouble using it. Got G-mail to work fine, internet works well is fast, still do not know how to delete the most viewed pages! mine. Lack of manual was the greatest frustration . We yelled at each other on her birthday! As we could not figure why screen dimmed. Resolved by disabling auto brightness. A manual or a quick start would have helped . Key board has delete key & go key next to each other ,another frustration. Right size good screen color + resolution . Android is new to me, hence some of the problems. She is used to a laptop not a tablet. Finally got Microsoft E-mail to work! Not by use of manual, but by playing around with it! Actually for the money it is a decent tablet. Internet blazes,e-mail now works fine. Comments on power usage from reviewers here is a great help. I'm liking it a whole lot more!Screen size is ideal, a stylus helps with typing!We have a few more weeks to decide to keep it, or buy a 7" ipad ,if it ever comes out. She may never get the hang of it and may like her laptop better, but I might want to keep it!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought one and was very disappointed at how bad the WiFi connectivity was. I placed my laptop in the same area and had no issues. This unit would forget my parameters, lose the connection, and lock up. maybe i got a bad one but back it goes. Never could download a app as this dud would lose the connection halfway through. I have 10.1 Acer laptop that works fine with this WiFi setup, I'm using it now as I write this review. Too bad it looked so nice in the store.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The spec show me has internal 8GB memory, but after I check it by pressing setup to see, I only see 4.59GB memory in total.Why? something wrong of this. So when I try to install GPS program, It shows me not enough memory.Please don't buy it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|So, this 8GB tablet ONLY has an effective memory of 4GB. I'm not sure what anyone is going to do with just 4GB anymore..?? Also... when I put in the class 10 32GM expansion microSD card, it wouldn't even read the videos OR music from the card or play the movies, so what's the point of being able to expand? And there is NO WAY to move APPS to the SDCARD, so you are stuck. It's worthless. I wasn't impressed with the speed or function either. There was a lot of Samsung BLOATWARE on the tablet as well that took up space and was useless. I would recommend the Google (ASUS) Nexus 7 however. I bought the 32GB version for slightly more than this, and it is OUTSTANDING.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|can not place phone line to the computer, does not come for 3G, Wi-Fi is fast, acceptable internal memory, good weight-to-size, ideal for games,

tablet_galaxy_tab|Al tercer d&iacute;a de trabajar con ella empezo a frizarse, no tengo nisiquiera la mitad de la memoria del dispositivo llena y ademas de esto le compre una memoria de 32GB que esta vacia, sin embargo continua frizandose.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 over the Kindle HD for one reason - it has expandeable memory. Otherwise, my research showed them to be pretty similar, except that I have to purchase my movies from the Google Play store instead of Amazon.However, I purchased and downloaded a movie, and decided to watch it at home on my television, only to find out there is no way to connect this device to a television. I was told it had a mini HDMI port, but it does not. So I went online to look for some kind of adaptor. Samsung makes an adaptor, but it does not work with this tablet (it appears to work with all the others, though.) There is no such cable that works with this tablet. I have been told by Samsung tech support that the only way to do this is you must have a TV or DVD player with a program called Allshare to stream from it. I happen to have a Samsung Bluray player with Allshare, so I tried to stream through that. After an hour with their tech support, doing everything they told me to do, it still did not work. Also, this does me no good at all when I am traveling and want to hook my tablet up to a hotel tv to watch a movie. I will be searching for the receipt tonight to see if I can return it and get the Kindle HD.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I liked it when it worked but the screen kept freezing up. Had to call Samsung to have them reset it and it worked for awhile and then froze up again. After calling Samsung again they told me to return it to them where they can look at it and see if they can fix the problem or send me another one. They sent me a UPS return label but it takes 3-4 days to get to them. Samsung did send me a new one after they discovered the first one was a dudd. It did take a week and half to get back but it worked out. I love the product once I discovered it works. Perfect size for me.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Thus far the only drawback I've found with this tablet is that it does not have a usb port. Hence, I am unable to connect a flash drive to save information. Had I realized there was no usb port, I would not have purchased it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I live in a country without netflix and all those hubs and I have a $ 100 Chinese tablet (ICS) which is great because it has many conections and can do some things that this Galaxy tab2 does not, but I wanted one with better screen resolution and battery so I adquired the Galaxy tab2. Although it has some good things like the price, IR, display, GPS, etc. I have found a shortcomings that make me disappointed with the purchase. The main one is that I can not connect the tablet to the TV via all share to a Samsung TV, nor by the useless HDMI dock, or by USB, so this is a very serious flaw I find in this tablet, because I can not watch movies or read books from the tablet on my big screen TV. Another very serious flaw is that to pass files from the computer to the tablet is super slow.UPDATE; Transfer files from the pc to the tablet by USB goes faster now if you do not convert the video file just copy it.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i've had a handful of tablets, and this is the worse one i've had, it doesn't come with 8gb at all, they only give you 4.4, near half really? i understand 8 never means 8, but heck even the fire has 7.3gb, this one only 4.4 why the lie that its an 8? second, and biggest argument is while they rip you off and only give you 4.4gb, the fact that there is a sd card is a complete waste. you can not move apps on the sd card, because of design errors from the designers, the main hd on the device, thinks it is a virtual sd card, so while you can move music and videos and photos on the external sd card, you can not move apps there. i cant believe this defect got past the initial design. only reason i have this is to develop on, but i think its going to the device graveyard early, i wanted the nexus but they left out the sd card slot. why do android tablet and phone designers do stupid stuff like this? this is why they let apple control there destiny. its like they cobble this junk up half heartedly, and expect people to ignore the flaws it has.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Reviewing Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7inch wi-fi) 8gbMarketing seems to be legalized lying for the most part so I approach every purchase as a 6 month learning lesson ignoring all the marketing hypes and reading 'real' reviews from Amazon and other forums before trying a product out.My two-cents:The 7" tablets are a nice fit for the hand. I chose the Galaxy over Kindle Fire because I wanted to use Skype (ICS). Though the Galaxy allows Skype audible, the video function would not work. I was able to view my friend, but once I tried to activate my video cam the call ended. We tried several times before accepting the fact Skype (for ICS) and Galaxy will be fine for talking but no video as hoped by me and hyped by Samsung.Though Samsung's Marketing Team chose to list the tablet as 8GB, they failed to state the fact that you only get to play with around 3.7GB. The RAM is also around half...generally the RAM read 3xx/6xx (can't remember exact#). I took that to mean 3xx is being currently used out of 6xx available.There's a slot for up to 32GB chip, which sold me on it. But when I tried to use a 2GB SD micro chip, which I already had for my Sansa mp3 player, the camera on the samsung unit could only be viewed UPSIDE DOWN....turning tablet upside down only flipped the viewing so it was always upside down. I didn't keep the unit long enough to find out what other buggy stuff could happen as I was very discouraged at this point.Amazon's Marketing for Kindle Fire was upfront stating the 8GB model has 6GB usable.If only Kindle Fire 7" had skyping capabilities...even if video didn't work, I'd buy it.To be fair to Samsung, I liked the look and feel, and the price allured me...but in the end you have to be able to use the features it boasts and trust the company behind it to be honest with you in order to appreciate a product. Samsung, please list the info the end user needs to know, otherwise it's deceptive.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Galaxy Tab2 7.0 doesn't have (move to sd) on setting application optionso if you download 3~4 1gb games you can not download anymore apps there is no internal memoryspace.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Is it good, is it bad? It will not hook up to my TV.Do not get the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 HDMI Multi-Media Desktop Dock ... IT WILL NOT WORK..My HDMI Will not work with HDMI Multi-Media Desktop Dock .Strange thing is some people say it works?Does it? Or can Amazon be trusted?
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|i guess I wasn't really impressed because I own a Galaxy Note so I already basically have the tablet. But my biggest complaint is the touchscreen response to me is not about anything and the picture to me is horrible. My Note has much better visual!! I really wanted to like it, but I like the comfort of a laptop so I think my next purchase will be a all in one laptop/tablet. Sorry Samsung this just didn't do it for me.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|so far I like the galaxy but I got one of these tablet holder that have a keyboard with it how do I get the keyboard to work?
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Perhaps I'm just too old school but I don't like running my fingers all over a screen, leaving smudges everywhere and spending more time trying to figure out how to do something than actually doing it. The entire design of all tablets is not smart, it's aethetics over practicality. Where was the thought and research put into designing something you can actually hold? If you hold it on the edges, odds are you'll accidentally touch the on/off or volume button. Having to constanly go "Home" and then back into your apps is time consuming and a pain. Flash doesn't seem to work. It's just clumsy to hold and too delicate to the touch. I'll stick with a laptop.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm posting here because Samsung refused my post telling the truth. In short I purchased this for my daughter only to find out the truth about this product. I was truly impressed the first few days of use as she was able to download and use apps rather easily. However, to make a long story short, as I found out, the 8gb of HD space is far less than they advertise. Most OS on devices will take up between 1 - 2 gb which is normal, however on this device Netflix was part of the design team for the ICS OS and their software alone takes up 4.19 gb of hd space?!?!? Really??? Why not just give the consumer the ability to download the app. After you take into account ICS OS and Samsungs proprietary apps (which I have no issue with), you basically have approx 2gb of hd space. This limits the amount of apps that can be placed on the HD. That's not all, you cannot manage your photos, videos or music between the device and the expandable card slot. You have to connect the tab to your computer and manage the expandable disc space. This defeats the purpose of a tablet. Tablet's were made to free you from accessing a computer. Therefore buyer please be aware of what you are purchasing.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|On receipt the screen shut down about every 15 seconds. I managed to change the setting to 5 minutes, but that didn't stop it from dimming out every few minutes and then brightening back up. After about an hour of game playing it began spontaneously shutting down again. I'm shipping it back to Amazon tomorrow. Anyone need a Poetic case for this bomb? If so, you can have it for shipping charges only.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Out of 8GB internal memory; it was only 2.5GB left for my use. The OS is bit slow. Otherwise good.

tablet_galaxy_tab|So i got two of these one for me nad the wife. Well it has no internet so we had to try ot find mobile service. Everybody wants money for that and I found it to be just like my phone so I sent one back but the wife loves hers and uses it has a organizer for her biz.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|the tablet met most of my expectations.Samsung applications have many problems.The battery life pleased me much.its ok
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm new to tablets so i really have nothing to compare this to.. I was impressed with everything and it seemed easy enough to use but I was only able to connect to the internet in my home and at the Jetblue terminal.I took this tab with me to Jamaica and my house there has internet service but the tablet would not go to any pages.. it will say connected but still I was unable to surf the net.Very frustrating, so I returned it.I'm looking for something affordable that will allow me to access the internet any and everywhere.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've now had this device for 6 months, so i paid the $250 price, the fact it's gone down so much makes me wish i would have waited, as for that price, it's a horrible tablet, for the new $180 price i still would not buy it, but it's better. My mom has the kindle fire, after using it a couple times, it works much more efficiently than this thing. This tablet is SLOW. When you type on the keyboard it will not keep up with you. When you try to click things it way too often clicks the wrong thing, and you very very often have to try to tap them multiple times. The storage space is not much and mine was used within the first couple days so of course i use a microSD card. I do like how lightweight it is, and the cameras are okay. It's not very smooth at scrolling or moving between menus. The only real good thing, and a big part of why i bought it was running the current android market, but i hardly use apps anymore anyway. If you want something for apps mostly then this may be good, but something to use the internet all the time, it's not worth it, get another one that runs smoother.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am really disappointed that it does not function right, I was hoping it would work so I can use it on my downtime while deployed. Its not worth sending it back and waiting 3 months for it to get to me since I have to send it back home since they dont send it straight to Afghanistan, it still works but slow and only 4GB, plus if they couldnt get it right the first time then I have little trust. I will never buy a samsung tablet again since I had a bad first experience. I am really disappointed since I make sure to buy only Samsung example my tv, phone, and my tablet, seems like not that much but I have spent over 3000 dollars on just thous 3 items I may have to start looking around more.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Hi please send me a scanned copy of the invoice by e-mail as I have customs problems and require the bill as soon as possible. thanks
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I like it it functions well but the battery life leaves a lot to desire. This was purchased to replace my I Pod touch and the larger size is not an issue. The best selling point to me is I can now down load from the internet with out using itunes which I do not like.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I don't have much to say about this product. After the purchase and connecting to my computer the sync of photos and music didn't happen. And it would not sync my outlook calendar or contacts. Nemours calls to tech support and talking to second level support got me nowhere. Tablet returned. I will go the extra and purchase an iPad.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I was ansious because I need to get it in time and it came in the right time with everything include.Very good job.Thanks
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Like..d it very much but plan on returning. 1- screen flickered at first but gave it time. However it is now a day later and it's been doing it a lot. 2. I find the touch screen function to be erratic at times. 3. Couldn't get it to turn on once. But then next time could not get it to turn on until i put the charger on and battery symbol came up (it was fully charged). 4. Have not had enough time to go through all apps offered but do find problems accessing some as o.thers have noted and some seem to be worthless.PowerOn and screen flicker are most worrisome so this will be deciding factor in return besides paucity of books.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Purchased this pad mostly to read/download books. It works OK for that application if you want to do anything else as far as web searches etc. it's very slow and the screen is not particularly touch sensitive. I am spoiled by my IPad which is a great product! I was trying to save a few bucks by buying the Samsung - should have waited until I could afford the IPad mini - live and learn you get what you pay for - it's the reason that Apple is the Big Dog!Update: Couldn't take it, had to return to Amazon for a refund. Not that this is a bad device, it's just that the processor is so slow it's a bit frustrating - if you have never had an Apple product you will be fine with this pad. Sorry Samsung..........

tablet_galaxy_tab|This Galaxy 2.7 tab is unreliable. I would NOT have bought it if I knew then what I have learned by owning it and experiencing its limitations and trying to do the tasks needed for surfing the web. It chooses to put an unwanted space between the first and second characters I type in the 'web search field'. The touch screen and keyboard are unresponsive. Highlighting and copying text or web addresses is a nearly impossible chore of hit and miss frustration. The on-screen keyboard is either 'in its own way' or blocks the the area necessary for web page navigation. The on-screen keyboard has no forward or backward arrows. But the tech told me I could buy a micro USB keyboard that does have those arrows for 79.00 from Samsung. Warning me that it better be from Samsung because no other keyboards are compatible. Content sometimes is blocked or covered by an unwanted advertisement that I can work around on my PC and laptop but is impossible to overcome on the android with the controls that the device subjects me to. I am returning it because the problems I have experienced are compounded by very bad Samsung tech and customer support. It blocks content that I easily get on my laptop or PC. When on a chat page with a Samsung tech it locked up three times and had to be rebooted. The on-screen field that the Samsung website provided me was so narrow I could not see the text as I typed my responses. His answer was to "reset it to factory specs". Same answer as the last two times that the Galaxy started to malfunction. In fact that seems to be the only answer Samsung techs give. So now it's on its 4th factory reset and guess what? It's no better. Glitches seem to happen a lot with this tablet and not just while surfing. I find myself putting the Galaxy aside and finding other ways to accomplish my desired tasks and I am beginning to avoid using this hand held computing convenience. I have been spending too much time finding ways to bypass its limitations, and I resent its attempts to force me to do things 'its way', and still failing in the process. In a single phrase the Samsung 2.7 is "Big Brother in a Tablet." Thanks to Amazon for their generous return policy so I can be free of it. It's going back tomorrow.Jan 27, 2013 Follow up: I have purchased a Nexus 7, 16 gig tablet for the same amount of money I paid for the Samsung galaxy 2.7. So far the Nexus is superior in every way that I have used it compared to the Samsung Galaxy. The Nexus has better WiFi capabilities, a much more responsive screen, and it anticipates what I need to do and is always ready and able to accomplish what I wish it to do; and does it in such a capable way that it brings a smile to my face and appreciation for its intuitiveness. I cannot say that for the Galaxy 2.7. I would urge anyone that is considering buying a 7 inch tablet to avoid the Galaxy 2.7 and instead purchase the Nexus 7.

tablet_galaxy_tab|The tab froze when I first turned it on and would keep freezing throughout the day. Amazon sent it in a tiny box and wasn't taped or sealed. Anyone could have opened it and took it. No protection in the box what so ever. The tab was suppose to be brand new, but it wasn't. Some of the packaging was missing as well as the box had been tore and resealed. I would not suggest this product to anyone. I would get a different tablet because this one freezes. Sent it back to Amazon for a full refund!

tablet_galaxy_tab|I had the Kindle Fire and I was really impressed with it. I liked the way it provided me options and the apps were specific and they worked. The apps for Samsung, like the radios sucked. As soon as I figure out what app I had on my Kindle Fire (I broke the screen) I'm going to try and install it on the Samsung. I think I should have waited for the new Kindle Fire.I hope to start writing my own apps soon and I want to use the Samsung to try them out.Well see how well that goes.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The Galaxy tab work's very well. I had a problem with the SDHC card of 32 Gb because it doesn't fit, the seller sent me the wrong Flash card memory.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|The option to store maps and applications on the external flash memory card has been deactivated which makes storing offline GPS maps impractical due to the limited internal memory of this device. Samsung expresses no desire to reactivate the option. Solve this problem and this becomes a five star review.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this galaxy tab 1 week ago and the internet would stop on certain sites for no reason. I called the next day and was told I would have to wait for level 2 tech support. It has been 4 days and 3 calls and no level 2 service person to fix or even explain my problem. I tried my daughters Kindle Fire and no problem. I am returning this Tab because of the customer service. If a company has lousy customer service they don't have me as a customer!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This tablet is a piece of trash. It freezes and after there is no way you can make it start again. Before you buy it please check in internet to see how many disappointed owners have had the same experience. There are hundreds of complaints about this tablet freezing and at Samsung nobody seems to know how to solve the problem nor do they want to replace if for a new one. Please check well before you buy it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Product specifications are incorrect, say it is 8GB but the computer operating system says it is only 4GBThere is no way to contact the seller
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this for work to use with app that we were currently using on a droid phone for Inventory tracking. I thought the camera would not be a factor but it does not focus well enough to read bar codes so I was unable to get any use out of it for scanning inventory. If it was simply purchased for personal reasons, my review would be different. I like the look and feel but a fixed focus camera on the uit broke the deal. Sorry

tablet_galaxy_tab|Thought it was excellent, but resolution not good, looks like a problem as the last line on any page cannot be read because of ads blocking it. the settings keys on the bottom right a big problem as you tend to touch it while browsing up. I should have avoided this product.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I own a Galaxy 3S cell phone and I love it. The screen is very responsive and one is able to accurately write on it with a stylus. However, the screen is just too small to take notes or do some of the other things that I wanted to do with it for work. So, I purchased the Galaxy Tab thinking that it would be a larger version of what I had in my phone minus the ability to make calls. However, I quickly realized that the screen was useless for writing with a stylus. I kept the Galaxy Tab for two days and then returned it. If all you want to do is play games and watch movies then I think the Galaxy Tab will work for you. However, if you want to use it as an actual tool for work - forget it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Purchased this with the intent of using it as an alternate to my iPad. WRONG!! Should of just stuck with the iPad because you can't update the flash player and if you can't update the player you can't use it. When going to the adobe site a message is received that says android 4.0 or greater cant update. USELESS!!!! I'd return it but my dumba@@self thought this would be great and threw out the box.

tablet_galaxy_tab|BEWARE OF THIS SELLER:(lucjamie43)The seller was THE WORST. I'm sure the item was decent, had I ever received it. The seller never even bothered to reply to my emails. After a month had gone by, Amazon refunded my $$ and told me that the item was out of stock. It would have been nice if the seller would have told me that.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I've owned it for 5 months now. Samsung has released the Jelly bean update with no real intention of releasing it in the United States. I don't know if it's because of the Apple lawsuit or not but the fact that they have created and update and released it everywhere but the United States has turned me off to all Samsung products. Never again will I purchase a Samsung product.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Having the phone and the notebook the tab is useless. We are four in the house and no one is using it

tablet_galaxy_tab|I just received my tablet and it is not taking charge or going on could u please please help me before i write a bad review i hope u can help me solve the problem because the money it would take to send this back would be really costly

tablet_galaxy_tab|Purchased this online only to find out the hard way that it's a piece of crap design wise. In today's age where everything has evolved to mini usb this uses an apple look alike 30 pin proprietary nightmare to connect to the charger. The cord isn't well connected at the plug either so it pulled out. You can't just run to the store and get another charger or cord for this product. None exists in brick and mortar. I went out tonight to get the Samsung 30 pin to USB to try and charge my tablet only to find out it doesn't work that way. So I'm still waiting on my chargers to get here. I'll be honest, I steered away from Apple because of their proprietary garbage, only to find something worse. Proprietary with no support network. At least with Apple, everyone has it. Do a little more research because this sucks.

tablet_galaxy_tab|My model is now about 15 months old, android Gingerbread, so I am not reviewing the current model. That said, I have no complaints whatsoever about the older model (maybe the newer model is automatically better???). It is a very handy size, and I take it with me when I leave my Asus 10 inch at home. Display is very sharp, and so readable even given the smaller display. I am pleased that Samsung still provides the controls on the bezel. I can use my thumb to work them while my other hand is manipulating the widgets on the display. Battery life is impressive. Overall speed is good. And the durability so far is flawless.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I really thought I would like this tablet but I have hated it almost from day one!!!! I've got an iphone and considered the ipad but really didn't want a tablet that big. I LOVE the size of the tablet but that's where it ends. The product does not come with good directions, only start up information. I'm having horrible problems connecting to my home wi-fi which I'm finding to be a common problem after an internet search on how to fix it (Google "gaxlaxy tablet won't connect to wi-fi"). Apparently this is a problem that appears to be quite common and a hassle. I was primarily looking for an e-reader but got talked into this tablet by the salesperson due to all of it's capabilities. I've regretted this decision daily.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my wife to use as HER dedicated media consumption device. I did considerable research on the newer, state-of-the-art 7 inch tablets. Here is some of my thinking:- We have an iPad that was originally hers and which she uses to read her magazines, but which is too big to be conveniently carried on trips (and which is often being used by the kids). The new 7" Ipad is a lot more expensive, and Apple's closed system tyranny and draconian forced-obsolescence-by-sneaky-forced-upgrades-that-screw-things-up pisses me off, so I focused on Android tablets.- We also have a Kindle Fire that she also reads her magazines on, but that is also used by the kids for reading their school books. Since the Kindle Fire is also based on an Android OS and there is no problem accessing her magazines on it, I never considered that there might be a problem getting the magazines on a new tablet.I chose the Samsung 7" Galaxy Tab2 because, of all the 7" Android tablets, only this Samsung device provided for memory expansion.I am saddened because the 7" Tab-2 is a beautiful device, and it seems to work well for a lot of purposes, but to my horror, it is not possible to load any of my wife's favorite magazines (including Allure, InStyle, and a number of cooking magazines.) Some of these magazines are in fact available for purchase from the Samsung's magazine aggregator of choice, but they would require that my wife repurchase all of the subscriptions she already owns (they don't have a way to port over existing subscriptions, apparently). Repurchasing all of these subscriptions would more than double the price of the tablet itself.Perhaps it is not entirely the fault of this tablet, so I will concede that the one-star rating may be somewhat harsh. But I am pissed off that Samsung, Google, Amazon, Zinio, and the like, seem to be more interested in building their own fiefdoms and locking consumers into their own proprietary markets.This is not the "open" environment I was led to expect. Companies please take note: Holding your customers hostage is not a good long-term strategy!

tablet_galaxy_tab|My grandkids (all 4 of them) love my Samsung Droid Charge phone and all the apps I have on it for them. Thought I would pick-up the Samsung Tab 2 to ease the bottleneck on my phone.Although it has a poorer screen image than my phone, it was adequate. However, I am returning the phone - IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAVE APPS TO THE SD CARD!!!!! I could never get my filemaker program to work either.Called Samsung Support who verified that it cannot be done. Sean (at Samsung) really know very little about the tablet, so I asked to speak with a supervisor. Hoped to find out if an update was in the works to solve this problem. Was told he was on the phone and would call me back right after that call - he didn't.I wanted to load this with Apps for my grandchildren. I couldn't. It is going back~I purchased this from a company with a very liberal return policy; be sure you do the same!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Just printed the RMA... shipping it back. Can't download videos from Amazon (that function is only available on Kindle Fire and PC's... that was the whole reason I bought the thing). Plus, after dicking around with it for about 2 hours yesterday, the battery was 1/3 gone... (it's not going to last 10 hours like my netbook does)... plus, it crashed a half dozen times in the first day.... plus the screen orientation was often NOT up to the user (very annoying). Proprietary connector... hate that...In short, not ready for prime time.

tablet_galaxy_tab|UPDATE May 2012: I have lowered the rating down to one star. I purchased this tablet to watch movies and stream video but it simply doesn't work, probably because the processor is vastly underpowered. I suggest getting a more powerful 5" phone instead of this paperweight.Here is a list of what works and what doesn't on this new Samsung Tablet 2:1) Bluetooth Audio = Hard to pair to headphones. Often the bluetooth devices don't register, however, once paired, the signal is strong. Skill level required: above average.2) Bluetooth File Sharing = No two way file transfer with Macintosh. One way only.3) HBOgo App = Is not yet available for Android.4) Flash Video Playback = Random results, sometimes it works sometimes if does not.5) YouTube = Works fine.6) Samsung USB Adapter = Reads SD card files and can delete files. Very hard to transfer files. Skill level required: high.7) 1080p High Definition video playback = often no audio, skips frames or crashes on all Android video players that I tested. The processor can't handle HD Video and sometimes not even SD video.8) Audio Volume = Excellent. The best of all tablets on the Market.9) TwitTV Apps = No Video. Some video podcasts exhibit audio synch problems.7) Peel Smart Remote = Good luck getting this one to work, I am an expert and it took me 15 tries to figure it out. Also it requires a permanent Wi-Fi connection, no Wi-Fi, no workie. When it does work it does a nice job except for the slow volume control.8) Nice battery life if you turn off the GPS and adjust Wi-Fi setting to "off" while at sleep. GPS is "on" be default.9) Screen is not sharp but most people won't notice the difference or care if they do. Acceptable for movies of medium resolution which is all it can play anyway.10) Wi-Fi seems to work fine, have not tested for distance.11) Camera quality is very mediocre, who cares, right. Video is noisy.Software review: the new Android Ice Cream Sandwich software that runs at the core of the Galaxy Tab is still marred by Google's inept programmers, you know what I mean, the pseudo-interface that get worse with every new version? Add to that the buggy software available in the Android Market and you get an overall unfriendly experience, still a potpourri of random hangs and crashes. Doesn't look like Google cares nor is capable of creating a friendly interface, too bad because it is Ice Cream Sandwich which really ruins the Samsung Tablet experience.Conclusion: The "Galaxy Tab 2" sacrificed some key components in order to sale this tablet for $250 and it shows, the processor is underpowered, to make matters worse, Ice Cream Sandwich is still confusing and cumbersome for the average consumer. As much as I like to recommend this form factor my final recommendation is to hold off a few more months, Apple will soon release the next generation of 7" tablets for about the same price and so is Microsoft, yes, Windows tablets are supposed to be solid contenders.More free advice: Amazon reviews of 5 stars are almost always fake and can be safely ignored, I suggest reading the 3-2-1 star reviews for a less biased experience before you buy.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this device and it was delivered on the day, when I went outside the city, leaving it home. When I returned in two days, I connected it to charger, and started to set it up. Suddenly the screen started twinkling, the devise went hot and than it switched off; I couldn't turn it on, no matter how hard I tried;I brought it to local official Samsung Service center and they told me some feature is crashed and nobody know why. Now I have to pay, additional USD 45 to fix it;Is that normal? and only within two days!Very disappointing!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I will never buy a samsung product again! My mp3 didn't even last 1 year before it stopped working, now my Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 won't even turn on or charge & I purchased it less than 3 weeks ago! Yes- I tried the hold the power button, with finger on tab volume up & down....nothing but black screen! They told me it needs to be serviced.... SMH! Returning it today not exchanging! -_-
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I'll admit I've been spoiled by Apple's simplicity and it makes this tablet confusing to use. Intead of one easy store there are multiple stores for different uses. The app stores are confusing and constantly have to update your device whenever you enter the store.Here are other dissapointing features;1. The camera quality is extremely poor; pictures look faded, discolored, have poor resolution, and are often blurry.2. The book I downloaded has to take at least 5 seconds to load each individual page; making it impossible to skip through pages quickly.3. The battery life is poor.4. It has a difficult time staying connected to wifi.5. Limited memory space.Overall it's a dissapointing piece of technology.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Hard to use always asking for my pass word try to get some music and I can't I feel is wasting Money to have this Item

tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a good tablet. This is my first tablet. The screen looks good. Ice cream sandwitch works well. I have heard that apps are not able to be transfered from the device to the microSD card.Update: I now have Jelly bean on this tablet and it is a nice upgrade. With the new OS you can watch a video on any screen while doing something else, really cool feature.Overall it is a nice unit with good viewing angles.Joh 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.Joh 3:17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

tablet_galaxy_tab|The only reason I gave this one star is because I couldn't give it NO stars. The product is probaly great but I definitely know "blinq" sucks!!! I waited four days for them to ship my product (they said it would ship in two) and I receive a message on the fifth day saying my order was cancelled because it was out of stock. They could have let me know a little sooner so I could order it from somewhere else and get it quicker (which I did). With the other company I got my product in three days from ordering it. Their saying at blinq is "if you blinq, you might miss it". I think they were blinqing for so long they fell asleep!!!! By the way, it is spelled "B-L-I-N-K". It would be a unique way to spell it if the company could run a business, but they can't.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this thing and used it maybe 3 or 4 times, then I got very busy and didn't use it for 2 months. Well, something inside must have shorted out because it wont turn on but my computer tells me its drawing too much current and needs to shut down the USB port. What a waste of $200+

tablet_galaxy_tab|hi, i bougth this item on november 26 and i continued waiting for the SHIPPED status.please i need an answerthanks a lotFrancisco Lechon

tablet_galaxy_tab|slowest shipping ever. I thought amazon was known for customer service. so ebay sells junk and amazon is super slow. I cant have it all. this tablet better work better then the crappy kindle fire hd, i just bought and had to send back, do to malfunctions.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I would give this a much higher rating but I haven't used it yet..I will get in touch with the help line so I can use it.Thank you...
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|For the money, you'd think the screen resolution would be acceptable, but it's not. The text is fuzzy and unpleasant to read, and, as you interact visually with this device, the screen is by far its most important feature. Otherwise, the device is excellent: fast, responsive, light-weight, etc. Unfortunately, the screen ruins this product. It looks like a knock-off.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|It was not a bad tab for the price, screen is not great, but it runs smooth with Android 4. So the first impression was good. But after about two weeks, it did not recognize my 16g micro-sd card any more. I pulled the card out and tried it on my pc, and my pc cannot even format it. I tried it on my camera as some online forum suggested, and got no luck either. So one 16g card was ruined with all my data on it.This leaves me with no choice but returning it for a refund. Luckily, I bought it from Amazon, and the returning should be smooth.UPDATESince my post of this review, a few smart (at least they are trying to talk smart) people have commented on it. What they said may make sense, but I am not sure how they have been using their micro-sd card on the tablet. I often took it out to transfer files between this tablet and a pc. And I have been doing this for my phone for a long time. It could be that the card is bad, but I will not take the chance. The slot of the tablet is not well designed for my point of view any way. I am not the only one who complained about this, I did do a search online before I blame the device.As for the comment talking about compatibility, could I suggest that you take a hike?

tablet_galaxy_tab|I ordered this item, so I can learn the Android platform. Already have an iPad & find the iPad a much better product.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I purchased this tablet back in April of 2012 with my cellular carrier on a data plan. My original reasoning was as an alternative to the more expensive tablet options out there. I made a mistake. I should have paid more for a better tablet experience. The battery life for this device is miserable. I often find myself having to charge it twice a day with really heavy use. But the worst reason for the device is the total lack of knowledgeable tech support from Samsung. I had an issue with the device trying to do a system update and failing multiple times. After a calling my cellular tech support, who then transferred me to Samsung, they were unable to provide any help with the issue. An hour later, Samsung threw up their hands and blamed it on my cellular carrier. Needless to say, the "system update" comes from Samsung, and that is what was not working. Bottom line? Don't purchase this device as a cheaper alternative. You won't be happy.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|When you order an item for a Christmas present you would expect it to come complete as stated. This tablet arrived from Samsung missing the charge adapter. You would expect their quality control to be much better then this. I am returning this product for a refund and will buy an Ipad.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I wanted a nice Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich tablet... But I got something much different. I have a Galaxy Nexus phone which I absolutely love, but I wanted a tablet that was a bit bigger to watch movies on and surf the web. I was very happy with my phone (android 4.0 is great) and I decided to give Samsung another go as my phone is working great. I thought this would basically be a bigger version of my phone (minus the GSM radio). Instead it runs Samsung's hideous take on what an operating system should be. Stock Android 4.0 is great, why does Samsung have to come in and ruin it? Google knows what they are doing, Google makes a great product, but companies like Samsung for some reason are unable just to make the hardware, they feel like they have to come in a theme out the operating system, install an entirely new interface, install a bunch of useless widgets on my home screen, install a bunch of junk apps that I'll never use. When I got the Galaxy Nexus it was so pure and clean, this is a huge disappointment. This Touchwiz nonsense has ruined the tablet for me. I won't be buying from Samsung again.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I knew within 10 minutes of buying this device that it was getting returned. The browser is s-l-o-w... It took 8 seconds from the time I tapped a webpage until it actually started loading, then another 4-5 seconds before the page was rendered. (Comparison -- on my iPad3, the page is rendered before my finger even gets out of the way of the screen.) Even getting a 'new tab' screen takes 3-4 seconds to be ready to browse. Then, with only 4 pages active, the browser crashed. The TV Remote app seemed like a cool feature, but it worked poorly--missing numbers when changing TV channel, despite pointing the IR blaster right at the TV.I actually liked the Android 4.0 ICS interface and the LCD is really great, but the underlying operating system here seems to be garbage. Maybe the tablet did not have enough RAM also. The device seemed to struggle a lot, and the UI hitches a lot, even with only 2 or 3 active applications. I made sure to check that I had the latest software, which I did. It's just disappointing.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|This is a great tablet but how am I suppose to use it if it's not charged? A charger and/or USB cable were non-existent! Failure to include these NECESSARY accessories earned the seller/manufacturer/supplier 2 stars!
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Specs seems to be Wrongits*GB space 4.59GB total GB space Thought it was 8gbWhile rest is reserved for OS(8gb) if you mess it up or something*Ram 687 ??? thought it was 1 gb. Which is misleading, why dont theyactually LIST THE SPECS from the tablet. I hope the processor is actual1ghz X 2.As for the reviewIts a simple tablet, good for the price I guessI just wanted something simple, not hardware restricted(can install filessd card from pc to tablet). Browsing/music, works fine.Web browsing works nice, Dolphin/firefox/android internal web browswerworks great, just depends on preference. I like firefox since itblocks ads, which is annoying.Video playback is nice can play 720p Mkv files/subtitles with mxplayer.Camera is HORRIBLE, they could of saved us 50$ by not installing the camera which is useless, its like a kids toy but I think the kid toy is highergrade lol. If you wanta tablet with good Cam THIS IS NOT IT.Built in speaker has a Hissing/static kind of noise which u can hear, its like thoseexternal speakers that you connect any audio device with a audio cable and they producea low hissing noise which some people dont tend to notice or care. This kinda bothered me.If you leave tablet on long enough, it tends to LAG up the tablet or slow down, usuallyhave to restart tablet it again, think its cause of the apps opening and closing, it has its own task manager to close them as well.You cant move APPS to SD yet. Since its OS problem, have to wait until they update it.You can install apps from SD to internal, music, movies so forth on SD card.One thing I like about all samsung products is ALLShare, its like windows network basicallycan share or view files all across connected devices PC/sam TV/phone sam, its REALLY easy to setup compared to windows network I always had trouble with. But its not nicelyorganized though, kinda ruins it. I forget if you have a LOT of media, takes long timeto scroll through.I should've of went with newer tablets with quadcore processors, better hardware and specs.

tablet_galaxy_tab|All Samsung Devices use the same charger.......the one the rest of the world uses.Why did they decide to cheat the customer by designing a Rube Goldberg charger for this thing?Pretty good slate........why screw it up this way ?
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Just got this so not getting enough burn yet.One big problem I have is, it doesn't recognize 820.11n channel 13. My neighbors have pretty powerful repeaters so for my stuff to work, I set my router at channel 13. This tab simply couldn't find it. I had to set the channel at 1 which is not giving me the same coverage.What am I missing here?
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I am not using it to it's advertised potential, but I use it mostly for the Kindle ap. I find the screen too small for much else and I guess I didn't realize or think about the fact that I wasn't going to get a $500 IPAD for $199. It's ok, but I would not recommend it to anyone.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought this for my son and everytime we went out of town with it we could not get it to stay connected to internet it would just sit and spin constantly and freeze up alot. I would not recommend this i paid this much money for one so i wouldnt have these type of problems but it happened anyway
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|I have the original Galaxy 7 wi-fi version, not this newer version. But mine was new once as well, so let this be a caveat to all who consider buying a wifi tab.I admit that I totally love this toy, and it would be the best electronic gadget I have ever owned -- except Samsung's dismal service and support completely suck the joy out of it. Unless you own the top of the line product and are signed up for the most extortionate data plan you can find, Samsung's attitude is "thanks for the money, now F off."Here are a couple of things you should be ready for:1. The included software will not work with your device. Not "will be hard to figure out" -- you will get an error message saying "this device is not supported." They could have just put a message that said "F You, Chump! &lt;click OK>". Also, the software [Kies]it will take 15 minutes to install, probably crash several times, and blow up every file association on your computer, making recovering from being told you can't use their software into a nightmare.2. Want a software update? Try CyanogenMod. You'll have to root it to get one. Fortunately, their sloppy workmanship also makes it fairly easy to do this.3. The battery will crap out in under 6 months. Fortunately also, since they don't bother to seal the body with anything you can pop the thing open with a wine key and fix this yourself. No! Wait! You'll HAVE to fix it yourself, since you'll get no help from them. They'll refuse to just sell you a battery and will charge as much as a new one to fix it for you.4. The hardware inside this tab is nearly identical to the hardware in a Barnes and Noble Nook Color, which is $100 less. Samsung does not tell you this, deliberately misleading you into thinking it will be the same as the version they actually care about.In short, unless you're into rooting and tinkering, this toy will only be fun as long as it still has new toy smell. As soon as real ownership kicks in, you'll just get thrown under the bus.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I did not need the items as they were gifts and my sister had already bought the 10 inch Samsung Galaxy Tablets at Costco for her kids. I called Amazon and asked if I could return them since it was less than 30 days since I received them and they were still new in unopened boxes. The Amazon representative said sure and emailed me 2 free shipping labels (I had placed an Order for 3 total on 2 orders I week apart). I dropped off the items and the return was processed the same day. I was surprised however that they charged me $9.81 return shipping on one and almost $12 on the other. This was conveniently (for Amazon) deducted from my refund for each item. I called and complained and they said it was a billing mistake and they would correct it and issue a FULL refund. Well I am still waiting. So much for honesty, integrity, and transparency. Buyer Beware. I am a prime member and buy allot of things through Amazon. I have never had this problem before. However, it may be a worrying new trend and/ or pattern.Kevin

tablet_galaxy_tab|I am returning two tab 2's because they would not connect to wireless N. I cannot even describe how upset I am about returning these. It's small, pretty and powerful but since it is wifi only it must then be able to connect to all wifi connections. I have a Galaxy S 2 phone and love it but after this tab 2 upset I may never consider Samsung anything ever again. Come on SAMSUNG!!

tablet_galaxy_tab|Hi. I bought this Tablet from Frys. It worked great at one location. Then I went to work and that location DOES NOT have internet access. I could not use the Tablet! I could not read a book, watch a movie, get on the internet. IT DOES NOT work without internet access, period. I am returning this tablet and had to mark it down from 5 stars to 2 stars.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I TOOK IT aNd THRew IT ON THE GROUND!! I DONT NEED THIS THING I HAVE AN IPAD AND ITS WAY BETTER
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|After reading all the glowing reviews I decided to buy one myself. After owning two iPads, I thought I'd give Samsung a try. Unfortunately even when the tablet was working this piece of crap doesn't compare to the stability and longevity I had with the Apple devices. After getting the run around with invalid serial numbers on my return process I gave up and bought the latest iPad. Sorry Samsung you are a disappointment.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have purchased Samsung products ranging from HDTVs to Phones. Older products were ok. The quality in the last 5 years is TERRIBLE. They will not stand behind their products. Google Samsung products/problems if you doubt this. Save your money and your sanity!Please see the reviews of Samsung at: Consumeraffairs.comYou are going to be extremely fortunate if your purchase does not develop problems; mine did - just after the warranty expired. Samsung has been involved in a number of lawsuits concerning their products. As I previously stated: Look it up on the internet.This post was made for potential purchasers, in order to save them time and money, not to engage with those "happy owner's" who wish to engage in useless debate trying to defend cheap plastic and a less than stellar corporate policy. If you only wish to read happy reviews, please stick with the 5 star reviewers.Investigate the Company and the product(S) and if you are happy with the results found in your research, then by all means make your purchase.But,the reviews found here are not product evaluations made by professionals.Most reviews are days or only weeks old from date of purchase. Look for longer term use of the products. Our concern should be to help future buyers make decisions based on facts not assumptions or projections.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have the chance to play with the other better Sammy 7 Plus for several weeks. I had this for a few hours and hand down the 7 plus was more better overall feel and performance. This 7 is a little bulkier, but overall look was very similar. The GPS did pickup quickly even in indoor. Screen was similar and it really good comparing some pro reviewer stating the 1024 by 600 PLS screen looks poor. Camera shoot was not good either. Even ICS can't save it. My problem was the touch screen can't registered my finger when click on apps. I will try a few week to see if the screen breakin better tho. Loading time on the apps and browser is subpar compare to the 7 plus. Sorry this well be return for a 7 plus, even is it more pricier and still run on honeycomb. There will be a big Sammy update for most of thier device this coming weeks. Samsung should of keep their in-house Exynos processor and GPU.
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|"you get what you pay for"First of all, I should warn anyone that has already bought this product to treat it very gingerly as the screen and build quality don't seem to be as good as other tablets. The OS is a bit of a cluttered mess and reminds me of 2007. There are a lot of apps for android but really, how many flashlight apps do we really need? Overall my recommendation is to pass on this and look elsewhere for a device that can do more and do it better.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I bought the Galaxy 2 Tab because of the posibility of adding a microSD 32GB storage... but now that I realize it will only work for my music, videos and docs... i guess im moving on.Even so, some media players wont read /extSdCard for music or videos.I though this could be fixed somehow so I rooted my device.I checked the platform.xml was properly edited on /system/etc/permissions, so the /extSdCard could be use.I can write to extSDcard, but its increasingly frustrating.... this stupid device shows internal storage and sdcard as the same storage pool. Apparently all Honeycomb and ICS devices do.Cant use extSDcard for anything but the music and videos, which is pretty retarded....whomever said 5GB (about 3GB goes for the OS) is enough for apps is clearly mistaken.Fifa12 need 1.6GB... which is downloaded to /sdcard aka internal storage.... with on option to select /extSdCardGTA3 need 500GB ... which again goes to /sdcard.... there goes 2GB just in 2 games...pretty much anything that writes data to /sdcard, which are ALL the apps and games out there... will have to be squeezed into the 5GB available space in the SGT2.... Link2SD, which I use in the cellphone can move files to the sdcard since the internal storage was not retardedly mounted in /sdcard...I think this galaxy tab isnt gonna last a weekI guess I'll have to sell this junk too and get me an Asus Transformer TF300

tablet_galaxy_tab|was looking at ASUS TRansformer and Samsung Galaxy android 4 devices. saw alots of review complain about frequent crash. when you have so many crash among different devices using same OS, it points to stability of OS. is android 4.0 stable at all??? sorta makes me afraid to touch android device now...i got 5" samsung galaxy 5.0 mp3. i enjoyed it so much and decided to get samsung galaxy 2 7.0problems:1>there is display issue with automatic dim control. it is broken until you patched with software update. i think it is android OS's fault.2>it is difficult to access microsd. i finally figured out ways to access microsd for some of my favorite android apps. there is no excuse for android to do that. this part should be seamless.3>there is only one orientation to attach your galaxy tab 2 to your keyboard. to me, that is EPIC FAIL, because i am youtuber. not having choice to orient the galaxy tab 2 correctly for youtubing experience spells EPIC FAIL. samsung should provide 2 ways to orient your device.9/19: found the keyboard is pretty useless unless you use it, because it oriented the tab in wrong way. at current orientation, it cause problem:1>not ideal position to view youtube or video2>not ideal to browse or write, because the font is alot smaller.so to do video, browse, or write, you need to oriented different way, but then you end up not able to use keyboard. pretty stupid of samsung to comeup with useless keyboard. no wrong they give away for free...4>i also experienced android OS death. i am not talking about app froze and die. i am talking about OS froze and die. seems to me that android 4.0 is not stable...5>more android EPIC FAIL. try chrome -> settings CRASH!!! it is reproducible bug!!!9/7: android another EPIC FAIL froze and crashed. lol, my windows 7, i put tons of stress computing on it. it never crashed past 1 year. android crashed so far 3rd time. EPIC FAIL...9/12: flaws in android system1>too many apps/games running when users are not using. running apps/games hug important resources which leads to slow and sluggish app performance (user is using it)2>OS with too many multi thread problems and deadlocks that lead to constant apps/games/OS FROZE, CRASH, and BURN3>system with dual core should be powerful enough. i remember owning lenovo lap with dual core 1GHZ speed (same as samsung) and Vista. the lap was slow and sluggish due to Vista OS. once i upgrade to Window 7, it became much smooth. so obvious nothing wrong with hardware spec. it is OS causing the problem. same here, samsung hardware spec is pretty good, fundamental flaws in android OS design caused constant apps/games/OS SLOW and SLUGGISH performance. it also caused constant FROZE, CRASH, and BURNbottom-line: android is EPIC FAIL.9/18: android OS crashed more often after I added say 5-6 more app and games. SERIOUSLY, android OS is inferior product compare to windows and apple. android is EPIC FAIL.9/21: android is EPIC FAIL, in my QQ player, i need to setup player to do smooth rending vs high quality rendering when CPU is busy. why should CPU busy when i am just running QQ player? reason, there is tons of other thing running that you dont need. game is running, stupid kindle is running (i dont even use it), tons of other garbage (garbage i am not using) are running. why goole design OS this way is beyond me. they dont even let you uninstall those garbage.. tab 2 garbage app is twice of my 5" samsung galaxy 5.0 mp3. no wonder twice slower...9/21: keyboard orientation is EPIC FAIL!!!! at current orientation, you dont need to scroll up and down that much, but you constantly need to enlarge the font and move left and right to read. wonder who raise their hand support this orientation. if they do the orientation differently, you dont need to enlarge font that often or move left and right (because font will be displayed at larger font). you probably just need to scroll up or down. and viewing video will be perfect.did they do current orientation for kindle viewing purpose? but why would anyone use keyboard while doing kindle? lol, it is very puzzling that no one mentioned this usability problem. this is EPIC USABILITY FAIL... EPIC... at this point, i am using keyboard less and less. lol...10/13: android EPIC FAIL. android crash every day about once a hour. EPIC FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL .....

tablet_galaxy_tab|My wife was looking for a wifi pad. All she wanted to do was to read her Email, occasionally surf the web and play a few games. I suggested the Kindle Fire, but she read Consumer Reports and was hung up on getting the Galaxy. Wellllll, wasn't a good idea. The Galaxy probably does so much more than my Fire, but my Fire is very user friendly and my wife is not a techie and she is getting frustrated trying to figure out how to use it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Pros:Flash player7 inches or soWifi works fines even tho it says 1 to 2 barsCons:I do not like how the screen feels and finger prints gets on it way to easy.wifi stays on when it goes on standbyNo way to close open programs other than restarting the tablet
---
tablet_galaxy_tab|Very few case options for this device. Many cases dont even have hole for camera and flash. It may not seem like a big deal.. but when your protecting your investment, you'd think there should be more options. Go with a different tablet.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I recently purchased a 7 inch tab. I was so excited about this new device. Then it arrived and I found out that I needed extra parts to be able to do anything with it. At every turn, when ever I have had to contact Samsung for support, the answer has been, we cannot help.If you buy one of these products, be ready to go it alone. Samsung will do nothing to support its customers.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I am disappointed with this tablet. My kindle fire is so much better within every aspect. Really disappointed with it.

tablet_galaxy_tab|it so bad that i decided to sold it last month ,a a a a a a a a a a

tablet_galaxy_tab|I'm sure the Samsung Tablet is a great product. The problem I have is there is no User Manual with the purchase and the options you have are (a) download a 228-page pdf document or (b) buy a manual in addition to the price you have already paid for the unit. Samsung claims it has "documentation" but what they provide is a tiny booklet called "Quick Start Guide" for which you need a magnifying glass to read. and with it is a 119-page "Health & Safety and Warranty Guide" in one half of the booklet and the same information in Spanish. This booklet is 2-1/2 inches by 4 inches in size! Nothing in that tells you how to use the unit.If I had known these limitations I would not have had the unit bought for my daughter. I spent most of an hour on their chat line about requesting a user manual at no charge and the end result was Samsung answer was that it has joined the environmental consciousness movement - what that means is they want YOU to print out the manual and use 228 pages of paper so they don't have to. And when I requested a further "escalation" of my request, I was told to provide a mobile phone number which I don't have.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Nothing works. No voice to text, no matter what settings I use. Right now I can't play sounds because the thing simlply won't accept the command in settings. Nope. The little x just stays there, mocking me. And don't get me started on email. The view changes for no apparent reason, saved drafts can' t be deleted and typing on this tiny no-voice-to-text keypad is such a chore that I just end up calling people back. On my gallexy s II. That phone does everything better, without causing me to yell at it and scare my dog. Expensive lesson learned. Edit: 2 months later and several hours with Samsung support, and I hate this thing is even worse. on my way to the landfill now.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Mediocre everything. Doesn't do anything particularly well. Rented a movie and it froze a few times when I try to play it, I had to restart the tablet to fix the freezes.Good device overall. Expect glitches when you use it though.

tablet_galaxy_tab|Like galaxy tab...but camera is bad...pictures are soft and out of focus...and any movement while taking pictures come out blurred.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I have the Samsung Epic phone that uses Gingerbread 2.3.6. It works relatively well and has few issues. The phone is 2 years old.I purchase the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 in hopes that it would do certain things that the Epic phone cannot do. Unfortunately the opposite is true. The Tablet using Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.4 will not do many of the things the older phone will do.After only having the Tablet for 2 months I have already had to return the Tablet back for replacement because the camera did not work correctly. I received my replacement Tablet and the camera still does not work as it should. I installed the Face Book App and in less than a week it completely wiped the Tablets ability to do searches in every single program on the Tablet. After trying everything that could be done I finally had no choice but to do a full restore and restart the Tablet from scratch.I just installed the US Postal Service app on my phone and went to do the same on the Tablet and the Tablet informed me that the US Postal Service app is not supported. WOW, does it get any more pathetic.Many of the programs which work great on the phone are at best poor performers on the Tablet.When typing in any of the programs try moving the curser to the end of a sentence. Good Luck. The curser jumps all over the page and does what it wants and not what you want it to do. I attempted do this review on the Tablet but was simply not able to do so because I could not keep the curser in one place long enough to make the review.Battery life is pathetic. At best, steady use 2 hours. With all programs turned off and the tablet not in use, 24 hours if your lucky.The touch screen if so insensitive that you have to push the screen hard at times to get a response out of it.Had I known that this Tablet performs so poorly I would have never bought it.Samsung I trusted you in the past. I will never trust you again. Like the saying Burned once "Your Bad" Burned twice "My Bad"I will not get burned by Samsung's failed attempts at making bad Tablets. Next time I try the IPad. It might cost more but at least it works.I hate throwing $250.00 into the wind.

tablet_galaxy_tab|I own a Kindle Fire, and haven't had it long enough to be a dedicated fanboy. I AM an apple fanboy...now. I've always wanted an iPad and was saving up for a "the new iPad", but I can't spend that much on a tablet right now. So When I saw the Galaxy Tab 2 7" I got really excited. Finally a full fledged tablet at the right size at the right price, with awesome specs. I could return my Kindle Fire and get a machine without compromise...or so I thought.I used to have an Android Galaxy S phone, but switched to the iPhone because I was tired of all my phone's random glitches and crashes. An example was being told I was in Sweden while I was in Tyler, Texas. My wife made fun of me because I used to gripe non-stop about how much I hated my Android phone, vowed to never get another one, and yet was drooling over the new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. I called to every local dealer till I found one who would sell it on saturday (the day before official release).Right out of the box I loved it. The screen was great, the smooth bezel and perfect size, the expandable data capability, and the control bar, which is one of my favorite features on the device, made everything so much easier. I could put icons and widgets wherever I wanted to. I had full access to the google play store. That's where the benefits started to fall off. I bought the Kindle Fire to read, surf the web, manage documents and have something for my 5 year old to play on, it worked great for all those things, but it's very limited by the Amazon Android shell. OH, and the speakers worked way, WAY better on the Galaxy Tab 2 than the Kindle Fire's anemic speakers.All that being said, the Galaxy Tab 2 wouldn't/couldn't sync up to my Mac, MAJOR issue for me, I absolutely hate windows os. I tried installing the android software meant to assist with data transfer for macs directly from the Android website, to continually get a, "please connect device to initiate file transfer" (paraphrase) message. To transfer files I could only use dropbox, which ultimately is a slow and somewhat painful replacement for direct file transfer. Strike 1.There were serious formating issues with my ebooks when I finally managed to get them to the Galaxy Tab 2. I purchased and set up a handful of top rated ereader programs from google play, moon+reader ($4.99), aldiko (free), the Kindle app and a couple others. Paragraphs were separated by several lines of blank spacing, and the paragraphs were cut in odd locations not waiting for the actual end of the paragraph. I used epub and mobi formats to no avail. Calibre was also not able to be called on for assistance since my computer couldn't recognize the Galaxy Tab. Strike 2.A smaller, yet still frustrating issue, probably fixable with a different browser program, is something I'd come to respect abou the Kindle Fire. On the Kindle Fire, when viewing text on a website, I could zoom in on the text and it would be reformated to fit my page. This made it so I wouldn't have to scroll around, thus easier to read. The Galaxy Pad did not have this feature and I was scrolling constantly when surfing. As I said minor issue, but still. Strike 3.Then I couldn't get any of the Amazon HD apps to run on the Galaxy Tab 2, more of an Amazon issue really, but I didn't want to be forced to purchase all the same apps over again, expensive and a major hastle. Strike 4.The reason I got rid of the Samsung phone was because it was glitchy and wouldn't work. I got rid of this for the same reason. I love my iPhone, it simply just works, and works really well. I started having PTSD when the Galaxy Tab started to throw problems at me and decided I would go back to the Kindle Fire, like my iPhone, it just simply, works. The Kindle doesn't do half the things I wanted to get the Galaxy Tab 2 for, but it works really well for the main reasons I wanted it. I'll get over the stuff I'll lose.I know these aren't necessarily strong reasons not to get it. As I said there are a lot of benefits to using the Galaxy Tab 2, but it does not in any way replace a Kindle Fire if you are an avid reader, or if you're a mac user.
