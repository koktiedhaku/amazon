tablet|Simply good the way it is. The only thing I miss is passwords for the user accounts, but perhaps that's Google's job to provide. Otherwise I like its fast responsiveness and good materials, discrete elegance.

tablet|when i first got it i loved my nexus but now its becomin very frsutrating to charge it every day for like 4 -5 hours. if i am playing games then this get discharged in less than 6 hours. i dont know if this is a defect or what.
---
tablet|Basically what you expct from a tablet: fast, reasonable battery, no extra junk like GSM. No issues with it so far either, though using CyanogenMod is highly recommended to get the full experience.The only downside is the lack of MicroSD slot and no dedicated HDMI slot.I'd recommend the 32GB variant.
---
tablet|Very small and convenient size. Very easy to set up. Easy to take with me.There are programs like Evernote that help keep meconnected. I like it very much!!!
---
tablet|I love this tablet! It's powerful, clean, and pure Google.No bloatware at all and is price is right.The only problem I have with this is there is no micro card support. I understand why but still, that socks. I also believe that Internet service should be optional for all devices. Overall this is a great tablet. Highly recommended.

tablet|I traded in my 10&#34; Toshiba Thrive for this baby and I'm glad I did. I was looking for something more portable to use at work (my job has a lot of down time where I can read or listen to music, etc.) and this has fit the bill perfectly. My favorite feature is that I can connect to the internet via the Bluetooth connection on my phone, so I almost exclusively use my Nexus 7 at work to do online activities. The price was a huge selling point for me as well, and I feel I have gotten a lot of bang for my buck.

tablet|this is my second tablet after an archos 70 which got old too quick. the nexus is lighter and much more powerful, the processor with quad core is great, however not having any expansion via sd is a real drawback
---
tablet|I bought this when it first went on the market . It is awesome i love itIf you're looking for a tablet look no further this is it
---
tablet|great service, and it came in less than a week! no problems :) couldnt be more content with my nexus
---
tablet|Works great as stated, very pleased. I bought this for my ten year old grandson and he is using it to study and do school work on. He also has his games downloaded along with his music, he is very pleased.
---
tablet|I got the Nexus 7 as a Christmas present. I use it everyday. It's just so easy to use, so lightweight, such a beautiful screen. I tried using the iPad, and it's awkward, heavy, and just annoying. Gave it a second try and still disliked it. My next big splurge will be a Nexus 10.
---
tablet|I have had mine for 3 weeks now, so far so good. Only peeve I have with it is the home page is full of ads and you can not delete or stop them.Update:Ordered a second one for my wife. She has had it for 2 weeks now and it also is working great. I'm wondering if some of the battery issues with these may be defective chargers that come with them and not the battery?
---
tablet|I bought this in Nov 2012 and not had a problem until now. I was letting it charge at my desk as usual-nothing unusual was happening except maybe for the planets misaligning. Then i smelled smoke. looked at my tablet and luckily I was able to pull the micro USB end out of the tablet before the rest caught fire! I'm sure it was just some weird instance, but called ASUS to get a new cord (wasn't going crazing hoping for power-ball winnings) and they want the cord and tablet back! I bought this since i'm working on comptia cert, so I don't want to haul the telephone book around plus i have personal stuff downloaded on that at this point that I would prefer to remove-but I need a cord to do that.so bought a cord that i shouldn't have had to.I'll update if the tablet itself starts smoking, which seem perfectly fine at this point thank God.

tablet|Still learning what this device is capable of and how it will change how much time I spend on my regular computer.
---
tablet|Besides not having a back camera i love this tabletFor the price i couldnt have asked for anything better.It does everything i need it to whether i'm at school or just killing time at home.I love how it links to google play on the google site. i'm not sure if if does that for other android devices but i love it nonetheless.Used it for about a week now with no problems no complaints.
---
tablet|Wonderful tablet that gives great bang for the buck. Better size than an iPad, I can hold it with one hand, and better for reading as well as on-the-go
---
tablet|I love the tab. Works well using wifi. The resolution is clear but not as sharp as ipad or samsung galaxy S3.
---
tablet|We love this tablet. No complaints. My kids are the primary users. It is holding up very well to my toddler's daily use. (We did buy the MoKo Slim-fit case for it, which I highly recommend.) :)
---
tablet|I have had lots of different computers (and that is what this thing is) over the years. They all required various bits of tinkering to get them to work the way I want. In the past, this was part of the fun. These days, I want things to just work without a hassle. The Nexus 7 delivers for that requirement.I do have to say that I did have one issue. With one of the software updates a while back NFC (Near Field Communications) started using a LOT of battery power. I just disabled it as I don't use the feature.Outside of the NFC issue, the battery life is great. The screen is excellent.There are two things missing from the Nexus 7:A rear facing camera, but that is expected at this price point.SD (or micro SD) card slot. I see no excuse for this. Cost would have been minimal and I'm sure space could have been found. That said, so far, the 16GB has been enough space, but I don't store music of videos on it.
---
tablet|I purchased a refurbished Nexus 7, after having much luck in previous years getting factory refurbished electronics (laptops, phones, etc.) However, it seems like even the refurbished items have the same charging/battery issues.The very night my 16gb Nexus 7 arrived in the mail, I plugged it into my wall to get a good charge. I turned it on after about 2 hours, configured it to my Google account and saw that it had about 25% battery, so I figured I could start installing apps. After downloading a few *while still plugged into my wall*, my battery was suddenly at 16%. I assumed I must have been playing with it too much too soon, so I left it in standby mode to charge overnight.Ten hours later, my battery was at 6% and falling. The battery manager said it was charging, but in reality it was losing its charge. I shut it down and followed the suggestion on the Google support page (plug in, hold down power + volume buttons, reboot manually, plug in again) but it did not help at all. I left it plugged into the wall at hopes it would get some charge, but within a couple of hours it completely died and won't turn on at all anymore.Because it's factory refurb, I had to call ASUS, not Google. They did some basic troubleshooting (seeing if it was recognized when plugged into my laptop USB port, which it wasn't) but in the end they opened an RMA, and now it's en route to their US office in Texas.The silver lining is that if by chance you get a Nexus 7 that actually works, it will be wonderful. The 20 minutes I spent installing apps and playing with it was fantastic! Very smooth, very responsive, and lots of apps to choose from. The OS is gorgeous and, if not for my awful issue with it, I felt that the construction of it was solid and attractive. Unfortunately it seems that this charging issue is common - just do an internet search for "Nexus 7 won't charge".I feel like I've wasted my money and fear that I will just get another defective tablet in exchange for my un-chargeable one.

tablet|its a great 7 in tablet,feel good and just the right size, Google really created a good product in the right price
---
tablet|I'm not a tablet freak but the Nexus 7 might just turn me into one. This tablet is faster than my PC! Quad core which is lightning fast and jelly bean 4.1 rocks! When you buy a new Nexus 7 you get $25 to spend for free at the Google Play. Even though my network speed at home is awful it runs great when surfing the web. This tablet is just the right size and weight for me I didn't like how big other tablets were and how small phones are. As of now I would say its the best 7" tablet on the market. All things Google!
---
tablet|I'm writing this review on my tablet, and the most notable feature is how well the browser and keyboard work. The app selection is great, and the battery lasts multiple days between charges for my use.
---
tablet|I have owned this for a month and haven't experienced any of the screen or operating defects noted in other reviews. I think it's a great tablet and an improvement over all other tablets I've owned for these reasons:1. The speed - surfing the internet is lightening fast.2. The touchscreen sensitivity - other tablets I've owned (Playbook, even Fire) have trouble recognizing what I'm trying to touch/select. The Nexus, if there's a question, magnifies the words I'm trying to touch plus the ones around it so that I can choose what I meant. It's awesome.3. Movies run perfectly on it, and you can buy a lot of movies with the $25 free Google Store credit.4. The screen - crystal clear, like the Fire.5. The size - until Ipad makes a 7" tablet, the Nexus is the best bet for the size.I'm really happy I bought it!
---
tablet|I purchased mine from the Big W with the 2 year replacement warranty but felt the need to write a review here.Ok first off this tablet is lightning fast, not iPad 2nd gen fast but pretty darn close.Second if you buy before September 30th the Nexus 7 comes with the Transformers Dark side of the Moon Loaded on it and you get a FREE $25 to use in the Google Play Android Market. So for me it made the price even more appealing.Awesome movie quality resolution VERY CRISP!There are 2 small problems with this tablet though1. The rear speaker, it sounds a little muffled when you turn it up past 1/2 way, to remody it I installed a free EQ and just lowered the Bass down to zero and it sounds much better. (on the plus side headphones or external speakers plugged into the 3.5mm jack sound awesome with or without eq)2. The tablet comes with only a front facing camera, now the kicker is the tablet doesn't have an app to use it to take pictures, so you need to go to the app store and get the free camera app for it. Crazy I know but the camera is of OK quality, descent for skyping or video chat though.So overall for the money I really like it, you can get 2 of these for the price of a new ipad with the warranties and get $50 in free aps from Google Play.
---
tablet|This product is more than I exspected. My mother has the kimdle fire and this seems like a feather compared in weight. The screen is very vivid and watching Netflix is really great. I highly recommend. BYE FROM GOOGLE. Its about $30 cheaper and you get $25 free to spend on the play store
---
tablet|when i got it, it would turn on and that was it. could not get it to do anything. Called Google and they tried to walk me through it. They could not get it to work either.
---
tablet|I loved everything about my little tablet--display, speed, size, bezel size, weight, everything--but please be aware that it is NOT durable. I had mine in a padded case and it slid off a stack of a magazines about two feet onto the floor. Screen cracked, and now it's useless unless I plug in a mouse via an adapter (haven't tried that yet, but that's what the Android forums suggest). Even with a mouse restoring some function, I can't type. I was able to use this product for a grand total of three weeks. Its delicacy SEVERELY limits it portability; if you have to treat it like a Faberge egg and worry about it all the time, you really can't use it anywhere but sitting at home. Even then, be careful. Don't be tempted to treat it like a Kindle and throw it in your bag.
---
tablet|This device has a 1.2 megapixel camera. I tried to have a video chat via Skype and the quality was beyond BAD. If you are planning to use Nexus 7 to Skype or to take advantage of the camera, AVOID it, it's useless (and shame on Google for fooling people like this).
---
tablet|I really like this tablet butmust confess I am not using it as much as I thought I would.When home I have other computerswhen out, I am not always able to connect to wifi
---
tablet|This is a great little tablet. I bought it to read books on the plane mostly because I've been traveling a lot lately. Everything has been running perfectly so far.Screen - so clear!Sound - good speakersInternet connection - no lagging so far but I haven't done anything intensiveBattery - on standby for many days, maybe 3-4? if I turn off wifi when I'm not using it, it doesn't seem to use battery at all.Apps - great apps of course!Size - 7 inches is perfect for travel use and as a readerKeyboard - good, but I installed swiftkey which has been working well so farGoogle Now - pretty nifty feature! I haven't tested it to the full extent but it seems fun and functional so far. Decent transcriptionAndroid 4.2.2.2.2.22 or whatever it's on - running smoothlyonly things about it that I'm not totally satisfied with is the camera quality of the front camera is pretty poor and no rear facing camera. But do I really need to be holding up my tablet taking pictures? not really..awesome product!!

tablet|Excellent tablet for the money. Operating system very smooth with nice features (e.g. Google Now & Google Wallet).Display is sharp and size of tablet makes for good reading and game-play.More tablet-specific apps are needed (true for all Android based tablets). Expandable storage & option for 3/4G would also be nice for N7 (although I've read 3/4G as well as a 32G device may be available soon).Overall I'm very satisfied with Nexus 7. I believe it to be well worth the price & would recommend to others.

tablet|I preordered a first generation Kindle Fire. It came, I liked it and I used it for a couple of months, maybe a year.Then I heard about the Nexus 7, did some research, sold my Fire and upgraded.The Nexus is a far superior product.First, the operating system runs like an Android phone, which made setting up and getting into it a breeze. Unlike the Fire, you can run widgets on the home screen, like calendar and weather, and the Google Now function has some potential.The app store is the other big difference. Amazon is selling Kindle Fires to sell more Amazon content. Plain and simple. It is meant to be used with the Amazon store. The Nexus features a fully functioning Google Play store with access to ALL of the Android apps that you have on your phone.I am not a tech geek, but I can tell you these things: The screen on the Nexus just looks better when playing movies and TV shows, and the Nexus seems faster and more responsive. I have nothing other than feel to back that up.Yeah, I know the newer Nexus 7 is coming and the smaller iPad is out, but if you wait to buy the newest thing in computers, you will always be waiting. Whenever they make something, the newest is right behind it. This is worth the price and is a nice little tablet that I do not regret buying.
---
tablet|If your looking to get a bigger, more powerful Android experience on a tablet this is it. The 4 core Tegra cpu and 12 core gpu perform amazingly with little chance of slowdown due to custom themes or the most demanding video game. My only complaint is the speaker blew out in less that a day! A little research on Google revealed my speaker was not an isolated issue.
---
tablet|My biggest problem with the larger tablets is that they are awkward to hold while lounging and especially while trying to lie down and read. Their weight turns me off. This is why I took the plunge and went for the N7 apart from the fact that I'm a geek and an Android fan. The Tegra 3 and the prospect of having a Nexus class device that would be updated promptly was irresistible.So far, the N7 has only dazzled. I take it with me pretty much everywhere I go. It is a great companion device on the bus and while lounging in front of the TV. From Jelly Bean's fluid & intuitive nature, to great hardware, brilliant build quality and a gorgeous screen, the N7 serves me well as a reader as well as a multimedia device.
---
tablet|This is an amazing tablet and i love to use it.. very much! I ordered it directly from google but would recomend it to anyone that i know!
---
tablet|I was a little worried about buying this tablet because of all of the terrible comments I have seen. I bought it and I am really pleased with it, it is fast and great for every app. I think 16Gb it's ok for me especially if you have dropbox and google drive. I miss a camera but it's a great product. 5 stars.
---
tablet|This tablet really rocks. I used to have a Kindle Fire and when the Fire HD came out I was planning to upgrade. However, a friend of mine pointed me to the Nexus 7 by Google/Asus and changed my mind. With the Nexus 7 you have access to both the Google and Amazon ecosystems: just install Kindle for Android and the Amazon app store and have the best of both worlds. The only thing you don't have is access to Amazon video but I don't care about it.The Nexus 7 is a lot faster than the original Kindle Fire, has a better web browser and comes with Android 4.1.1 which has been optimized to improve the performance and the user interface.
---
tablet|Reading, music, movies, games, business, pleasure you name it. A device that I simply can't live without anymore. Shipped quickly and works fine.
---
tablet|If compare Apple IPad and Samsung tablet saw everywhere, Google Nexus 7 is very different and unique. That's what I want and like!
---
tablet|Amazing! Simply amazing. This cost me around 200$ the 16gb version and its performance is absolutely amazing. Faaaast... not laggy at all! the screen is so responsive... i almost touch the glass and it responds. Great great great performance!!! Not so lightweight , but not heavy at all. Won't hurt your wrists by holding it xD Feels well built and Durable. Not slippery. Has the perfect size to hold with both hands and type with thumbs. Typing is a pleassure :D A camera in the back is missing, i think a 3 or 5 mp camera would kill it. Front camera is cheap.. hehe... but i don't even use it. I recommend it soooooooooo far over the competitors.
---
tablet|Wonderful product. I love love love love this tablet. My grandson uses it for his games. thank you again. wonderful

---
tablet|I've had mine for about a year now. I love, love, love it. Super fast, super intuitive. I might have withdrawals if I had to go without it!I would buy another in a heartbeat.

tablet|As much as tablets do... there's a whole lot they don't do. This Nexus 7 reads powerpoint, excel, and word files well enough without an app purchase. Unfortunately, it's not too advertised, so I bought an app before I knew this. It also reads pdfs tolerably, though downloading Adobe Reader has been very helpful. It surfs the web okay... and you'll like it if you can survive without plugins that aren't compatible with any current tablet. Adobe killed flash on tablets, Silverlight isn't available for tablets, Java isn't available for tablets, vlc is a control for a real computer, and Realplayer is a shell of what it is on a computer. That's just the nature of any tablet out there, including the Google Chromebooks.The good- Nexus is good at viewing the most common formats- Nexus is good at social networking- Nexus is okay at internet(tablets don't have common plugins)- Nexus is okay at artwork- Nexus might be okay at 3D artwork with the new Spacedraw app- Nexus does Asian languages- Nexus has a few study apps that I don't know of a Windows program equivalentThe bad- Nexus isn't an ereader... your eyes will probably hurt after a bit(upd: Moon+ Reader PRO is exceptional however)- Nexus isn't great at editing documents... the app abilities don't matter, screen space and keyboards do.- Tablet apps are severely outclassed in every area by common programs that run on Microsoft Windows- Google Chromebooks priced less provide more for the moneyUpdated Info is at at the Google+ page Software Squeak.

tablet|I like my tablet. I am learning to use it. My daughter and son in law have two and love them. I just wish it had a camera.
---
tablet|I have only had my nexus 7 for 5 days and I can't put it down. This is one of the best tablets for the price. It is crazy fast, light weight, and has an awesome picture. I put a few movies on it for a road trip over the weekend and it worked great. The battery lasted a lot longer than I thought it would.
---
tablet|Best tablet for the money. Better than the iPad mini for half the price. I've had it for almost 5 months with no problems. It has been a dream. It has a great picture, great battery life, and gets the updates from Google quicker than any other tablets. Highly recommended.
---
tablet|I purchased this here on Amazon, thinking with the Asus and Google behind it, it must be pretty decent. Unfortunately, the wrinkles I've been waiting for them to iron out haven't been addressed.My main complaint is with its ability to handle simple tasks without freezing, lagging or downright crashing. I monitor the RAM load and try to stay on top of unnecessary apps running in the background, but none of this seems to help. Even as I tap out this review, I'm several words ahead before it catches up (I'm not a fast typist on tablets). I liken it to the overdramatic girlfriend who spazzes out over all the pressure when there's really no pressure at all. I should be able to browse Facebook or the internet (via Chrome; it's the native browser, FFS) without hangups. Alas, it's all too much to handle, I guess, but so she's locked herself in the bathroom until I give up and reboot.The display looks magnificent, but it has lately had phantom activations. It is as if it thinks I'm pressing on the screen when I'm not. Links magically get clicked or sections of text get highlighted for no reason. Maybe I'm being followed by a mischievous ghost. Or, more likely, the tablet is just bad.When I decided on it last year, I knew it didn't have a backward-facing camera. I didn't think it would be that big a deal. Well, it is more of a deal than I thought. Several times, it would've been handy to have for FB or Instagram when my phone wasn't an option. And you can't use Amazon's app - it won't even load, due to the lack of that backward-facing camera.I think I've had enough of it's shenanigans and will look at replacing it in the coming weeks. Might go with a iPad or another, more-stable Android platform. My advice to potential buyers: save yourself the heartache and look at something else.

tablet|I have one as my personal device and have had it since November of 2012. It is now April of 2013 and it works well, in fact, I ordered one as a birthday gift for a family member and she loves it too.Mine has survived a few minor falls and sneezes. The only thing I don't like is trying to find a true ASUS case for it. I was lucky and found one relatively easily locally (and I live in rural BFE). Also, the packaging for the one I have and the one I bought as a gift smells like gun powder, they must be packaged in a fireworks plant.Other than that, Google and ASUS delivered. I typed this review from mine
---
tablet|I received this unit as a gift from a business partner. I loved it out of the box but after 2 days it died. I was traveling and so I tossed the box before going home to take up less space. There was a sticker on the back that I also removed. BIG MISTAKE! If your unit is defective (which apparently is common from reading these reviews) then you need the serial number. There are three ways to get the serial number: 1. Off the box, 2. Through the system (if it's working), or 3. The sticker on the back.I called ASUS support which is overseas and after an hour of working with them was told that I was out of luck. No serial number, no service. I was livid since it's a brand new unit. I asked for a manager and was put on hold for a half hour before finally giving up. I called back a week later and the new rep Claude was a bit more helpful. He got me an RMA and I overnighted my unit to Texas for service. They say after 24 hours of receiving the unit you can track it online. It's now been 5 days and I called back and they are saying they haven't received it. I gave them the tracking number and the name of who signed for the unit.We'll see where this goes, but best case they get me a new unit that works in the next week. Even if that's the case, this is a one-star unit based on the defective unit and terrible service.
---
tablet|Nice size for most apps and display is very good. Wide variety of apps are available OS is very stable. Good battery life.
---
tablet|I loved it the first day I started using it. The screen is wonderful and Google Now makes it even more a pleasant gadget to have. I would definitely recommend it. My only issue with it, and not a big one, is the fact that the usb port cannot read external usb drives like my other Android tablet. I also wished there is a camera on the back. Other than those two this tablet is by far the best 7inch there is. A must buy.
---
tablet|I bought this for my mom and after two months the tablet would not charge or turn on. very unhappy with Google. I am in the process of sending it back now!
---
tablet|This tablet has amazing graphics for its cheap price i would diffidently choose this over an iPad mini for its price and this uses Google i really like this.
---
tablet|I like the android platform. Its very conforming to my needs. I us it for news, video, books (nook and kindle), some web browsing, email, blogging, and schedule work and home. For me, I love it.
---
tablet|For the price, the best tablet you can get. Battery life is exceptional for an Android tablet and it feels very hasty.

tablet|Bought this for my future husband for Christmas and he love its! There has been no issues with the tablet.
---
tablet|Lo recibi sin problemas, en muy buen estado, y la entrega fue rapida.Los recomiendo ! ! ! ! !
---
tablet|I really wanted to support this product but there are two things about this device that upset me: poor battery life and typing.In regards to the battery, after a full charge my battery will deplete extremely quickly which makes the need to be close to a power outlet very important. This makes the tablet less portable than advertised and more a nuisance than anything.Typing is also a pain. Making corrections and changes to things typed is very laborious and non intuitive. Its a bit choppy and doesn't flow as fast as I type.Hopefully future software update to the operating system improves the battery life.
---
tablet|I bought my Nexus 7 when they first came out. I owned it for about 2 months before it stopped responding to the touch and then I noticed the screen began cracking. After reading all the complaints online about this, I called Google Play. The rep from there seemed like a 17 year old kid who didn't know what he was talking about. He told me that since I didn't buy it from Google, I needed to "Return it to Walmart" I brought my device back to Walmart, but after 7 days they don't take back tablets, go figure. After a bit of arguing, I gave up. Then I figured, it's made by ASUS, so CALL ASUS. The Rep from there wasn't so great either, but he said he'd open a case for me to send it in. I was hesitant to do so, since cracked screens VOID the Warranty. After a week or two I figured I already paid 250 for this thing, I might as well see how much it costs to get fixed. So I packed it in a bubble mailer, and off it went. Not even a week later, I get an e-mail telling me my tablet is on it's way back to me. I figured they were just sending it back since it was a VOIDED Warranty.To my surprise, I just recieved the tablet back today, with a NEW SCREEN and WORKING PERFECTLY. Asus didn't call me to hassle me about replacing the screen, they just did the right thing and fixed it. If I had not gotten a cracked screen in the first place, this would have gotten 5 stars, but heck, if ASUS wants to stand behind their products like this, I'll keep buying them. Like I said, I was surprised, as most companies don't care a bit about customers after they get their money. Maybe they've had so many complaints that they just decided to fix them, who knows. All I know is I trust ASUS now, and I'll be a new customer of theirs from now on. THANKS ASUS!
---
tablet|I think it's an excellent buy, good screen, good processor, nice battery and slim. I don't give it 5 stars, because it lacks a HDMI port and a rear camera. But for the price is reasonable this lack.
---
tablet|I gave four start because the flickering screen problem o all the Asus tablets of this series , but its a perfect tablet
---
tablet|OK, so the ipad can do a few things this can't. But what are you really going to use ANY tablet for: internet, music, movies, email, pictures, apps and little work projects. This does all that with flying colors. Work and acts like any android smart phone, cause its running the same software. Great thing about it is you can have multiple things going and once and keep flipping between them. I take this with me to the gym. I have my heart rate monitor (blue tooth) that connects so I can keep track of my heart rate. At the same time I have my blue tooth headphones in and I'm watching 'The Walking Dead' (I find that to be inspiring show to watch while running). I can keep flipping between the heart rate program and my movie with no problems. The only thing I wish it had was an HDMI out on it. Besides that its perfect for me. I like the size and power behind it along with all the apps. You just can't beat it for the price and for function.

tablet|Just the right size, I have a mini iPad as well and the Nexus spanks it. The mini may be lighter and thinner, but the mini is too wide to be held with one hand (what was Apple thinking?!?). Best of all, no iTunes! Love my Android!!

tablet|I recently bought a 16GB Nexus 7 (totally new, in original sealed box) from the Office Depot, charged it fully as instructed and then after 4 hours of use it died and would not charge. Stone-cold dead. I returned it the next day and replaced it with another (also totally new, in original sealed box) and after 3 days of use the same thing happened. Dead dead dead. To the Office Depot's credit they refunded both my Nexus 7 purchase and the case I bought for it. I'm disappointed because it seemed a well-built product, fast and with a gorgeous screen, I really wanted to like it. Now I own a Kindle Fire HD - it's much better built, faster on the web, better quality, and definitely a better screen. It doesn't do as much as the Nexus 7 and there are much fewer apps available for it, but it does work and it's 100% reliable! PS. I just found some other negative reviews about the Nexus 7 16GB, they too said it dies. Apparently the 16GB version is not as well-built as the 8GB model.
---
tablet|Screen is coming unglued from bezel and lifting up on left edge. Feels mushy in that area. Backlight is flickering during network access when wi-fi signal is low. Sending my Nexus 7 out to Asus on an RMA tomorrow. These are widely reported issues and neither Asus nor Google has owned up to them or reached out to customers. I'll be thinking twice about future hardware purchases from either company. When calling Asus technical support, I experienced long hold times, difficult-to-understand accents, and audio dropouts from their phone system while trying to talk to them.

Here are the highlights:Super fast internetGoogle apps, Google playAccess to amazon reader and ebooksGPSLatest android updatesGreat screen, videoSpeaker and volume is OK for movies, TV.Camera is fine for Skype, etc.This tablet is super fast and does everything I want from a 7" tablet.

tablet|I am an iPhone user and I used to do pretty much everything on my iPhone. Browse the internet, read the news, play games, listen to music, organize my day etc. Since I got this product I only use my iPhone to call friends or tether my 3G internet connection to my Nexus when I am outside.It's all I expected from a 250+ dollars tablet and even more. I can say that the Nexus 7 is light and big enough to carry it around with you all day long. I use it now for doing everything. For example I can upload movies to it since I have file system access something that Apple just doesn't want to allow. I have access to almost all the apps that I've been using on the iPhone so I am not missing anything. Being a 7 inch tablet it's much easier to read a book since it's not heavy and the screen size is big. Same for movies. Hell, I have all my movies/shows on my media server at home and I now have a good streaming experience.The Google integration is fantastic and I was amazed by the Google Now app. I was surprised when the first day I got a notification to leave work at a specific time in order to get to my appointment. But what amazed me was that it calculated walking distance from the office to the underground, figured out which train I should get and how much I had to walk from when I would get outside of the underground up until I reached my destination. So good! Also the navigator app is fast and pretty good!Google Play is good, there are a lot of good apps in there and most of the apps I've been using on the iPhone.I only found 1 negative which for me is not that important but for other people it might be. It takes some time to fully charge it. I never owned an iPad to compare it with, but the iPhone is charged must faster. I don't know if it's a good comparison.I would recommend that tablet without any hesitation!

tablet|Quick, responsive, and good form factor. I've had the device for almost a month now and have put my Acer Iconia A500 to 'rest'. The Nexus 7 is screaming fast and I bluetooth it to my Creative ZiiSound D3X wireless speaker, the setup is awesome. Transferring files is easy as pie; just plug it in and then drag n' drop. Having external storage would be nice, but I have all my photos up on Picasa, so no worries there. I also upload most of my music to Play Music, and what's their limit? Oright, 20,000 songs (maximum 250MB per individual song)!!! If you use the 2 services, then you can't lose with this device. Highly recommend it.Note: The battery is also replaceable, and that's a big plus in my book.UPDATE 10/15/12: Just had an OTA update last week and now the initial launch screen can be rotated to landscape orientation. Also, I downloaded the system Chinese language pack and now I can perform a voice search in either Cantonese or Mandarin. I also downloaded the Google Pinyin IME and Google Translate. Now I can write using the Chinese keyboard and speak in either Chinese dialect to have it translate it to English. PLUS, Nexus 7 has built-in language pack (40+ languages) which can translate almost all system text display to read Chinese.With these features alone, I'm going to give this one to my mum (who's 80) and get myself the 32GB model when it becomes available. :-)

tablet|I purchased the Nexus 7 tablet for my daughter, because the 10 inch tablets were just too big for her to hold comfortably. The 7 inch is perfect for her though. And even I will admit, it is very comfortable to hold.This thing is fast! I haven't noticed any stutter when using it. The only complaint my daughter has mentioned is a few times while streaming Netflix it has had to stop and buffer, but I get that from time to time even with my desktop, so I can't say it is a flaw with the N7.The display is great! Everything is sharp and crystal clear. Movies look great on it and photos are amazing.I went with the 16GB version so it is possible to store some movies locally on the device for trips and what not. But most of the media is stored on my own personal cloud (not Google's or Amazon's cloud, I keep my own data and have full control over it!) But unless I download several movies I don't even come close to filling this thing up.Overall, this thing is great! Asus makes some great stuff and they didn't let me down with this one.

tablet|I really loved the Nexus 7" tablet but after only a day, Google Play store started refusing purchases. Tried several cards, all working perfectly and confirmed with bank that they were not blocking Google (both of my national banks and card services said they have constant problems with Google store, customer complaints that customers can't make purchases).I called Google who had me delete cards from Google Wallet and add them back - still no luck after 24 hours. We just get a message saying could not complete purchase and that we may get email to confirm our payment info. That email never comes. Called Google back again, went through four people - none of whom were enabled to do anything other than take down details and was finally told a specialist would get back to me "sometime in the next week" by email.It's worth noting that with Google you can call someone about app purchase issues unlike Apple, but at Google they can't help you.Also the same main apps and even most of my favorite ones that I have on iPad are available in Android and this is a huge plus.It's a shame I have to return it because we loved the tablet - well made and great screen. battery time is a lot less than the iPad and we had to recharge it after a day of use but still a wonderful device and 7" is definitely a nice size. The few days we had it I was reaching for it far more than the iPad 3. If it worked at this price it's a no brainer - you want one. It even blows the Kindle HD away - you can do everything with this tablet that it does and more - the Nexus is faster and feels much better.Overall it feels like a much more customizable tablet than the iPad, which I appreciate and was looking forward to using.Google now says they know it's a problem on their end so I will wait a few days to see and update if they fix it.

tablet|You may want to wait a couple weeks. Word is a 32 gb Nexus 7 tablet is coming very soon to replace the 16 gb model. It will sell for the same price as the 16 gb. That being said, I believe this tablet is the best value in 7" tablets on the market today. Has a more open OS than the Kindle and is far less expensive than the iPad. It will probably still be less expensive than the mini iPad when that is released.
---
tablet|It's very rare for me to give a 5-star review, but I'll do so for the N7. It's just an amazing little tablet. I've been using mine near constantly for three weeks now, and it has fast become my most used electronic device. I haven't even switched on my laptop in weeks, and my smartphone is now a distant second in overall use..quite the statement, seeing as I'd been on the thing nearly all day, every day.Feel confident buying this item. It's a highly portable, well-built tablet, with a beautiful screen and outstanding performance. At $250..well, it's one of the best tech deals we've seen in a long time.
---
tablet|Not my first Android tablet, but my favorite. Fast, responsive, crisp screen. No complaints after a couple of weeks of use.
---
tablet|I bought this as my first tablet, and I gotta say, after getting used to the device, I'm pretty impressed!First let me start off by saying...GET THE 16GB VERSION, if you are person like me and you prefer to have your music, videos, pictures, and documents on the actual device then get the 16gb ver. If you don't mind having your files on a cloud, or your always hooked up to wifi, then I'd suggest getting the 8gb one. Okay, now onto the review, the Nvidia Tegra 3 processor does a GREAT job running Jelly Bean, I've been able to run high demand games on mine without any frame rate drop that I've noticed at all! The device does a good job running multiple apps at the same time, no issues switching between Sims Free Play, Yahoo mail, and Facebook while all were simultaneously running. I did seem to notice that the device has a little bit of a issue when it comes to it's touchscreen though...if you press too roughly, the device won't register your input, however this issue is resolved simply by using a lighter touch while operating the device. Battery life is pretty good, device ran continuously for 4 hours before needing a charge, (I haven't let mine get below 25% battery life yet, so I don't have a very accurate battery operational time test yet), the device seems to require around a 2 hour charge time to achieve a full charge from 25% battery level. I'd suggest getting a stylus of some sort, mainly just for the fact that it keeps your screen smudge-free, while also giving you a more accurate touch.

tablet|At first i thought it was a little small because i have the HP touchpad , but after using it i found the size to be perfect . It's very light and using it is very smooth (Jelly bean and quad core ) , I love it .
---
tablet|I've had the Nexus 7 16 GB for about a week now and I can say that it has been a pleasure using this device. The speed and fluidity is awesome, Jelly Bean has really improved the Android OS. The battery life is by far the best I have ever had in a tablet, I do not have to carry a charger with me and if I do have to charge it, I can use any standard USB connection. The IPS panel is unheard of in this price range, crystal clear from any angle.
---
tablet|This tablet is excellent. Very well designed and great performance. I have been an iPad user since day one and wanted to try this out and see the best of what Android has to offer. Android 4.1.1 is very very good and almost as good as IOS 6. The hardware is excellent also. Not quite up to the level of iPad but HALF THE PRICE. Much more value per dollar here.My only complaint is with the lack of real software available for it. You just cannot buy software as advanced as you can for iPad. Simple stuff is readily available though. That is not the fault of this tablet though.
---
tablet|I have mine for three weeks or so. I am not a power user of tablets. I browse and watch Netflix. This is a nice tablet. The battery is good and the screen image is even better. I don't see the difference between this and an iPad 2. I compared against the old gen Kindle Fire and the Kindle feels junky. Worth the $199.
---
tablet|I love this tablet, it is not the biggest but it's size let you handle it in a easy way, and still a nice size screen to watch movies or web pages. Also real fast to process video and pages. All this for a reasonable good price!
---
tablet|The tablet is very light and easy to use. The android system is fast. A great tablet. The size allows you to carry it anywhere.
---
tablet|I am writing this review view from the tablet and I have to say it is everything I expected and more.The previous tablet I owned was a Kindle Fire and while the fire is indeed a good device it leaves a lot to be desired, such as bluetooth connectivity, access to Google play apps, higher end specs, and the freedom to manage my device how I want to.The main complaint I have with this is software related. This device comes with android 4.1, or Jelly Bean. Jelly Bean does not support flash which makes Web based video nearly to almost entirely impossible.Despite this, the device is incredibly powerful and by far the best tablet on the market. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone.P. S. The battery life is terrific! Went almost three days on a single charge.

tablet|Let me just say, this tablet is jam packed with the best technology out of all 7" tablets. It beats out the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7", the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0, and the Apple Ipad Mini in terms of specs and pure processing speed. The Kindle Fire HD 7" and the Nexus 7 are tied for having the best screens and screen resolutions in the 7" tablet market. This is the best 7" tablet I have owned... when it works.I have just returned my second defective Google Nexus 7 and have a friend who also returned his own defective Google Nexus 7. My first actually had a line of dead pixels on the screen and the second died and would not power on anymore. I am not an Apple, Amazon, or Samsung fan, but I appreciate quality tablets and electronics. This is not a quality tablet; don't get me wrong, its a great bargain for the amount of technology this little thing packs, but a quality electronic should not be so defective prone.Amazon, Samsung, and Apple all make quality electronics. One thing all their electronics have in common are that they are reliable and that they are all backed up with great customer support. The Google and the Asus partnership that produced the Nexus 7 tablet was a complete flop in this regard. Some may regard my post as an isolated incident and that there are always bound to be bad batches. Sure, yes it happens. On this level of magnitude, rarely. Check out what your fellow peers' reviews say and note hundreds of reports of screen and battery defects coupled with "missing screws and shoddy build quality"I really wanted to love this tablet and eagerly anticipated its delivery. A tablet associated with the company "Google" was bound to be popular. Unfortunately, they were ill-prepared for the tablet market. Being this is Google's first major step into producing consumer electronics, I am not surprised. Not enough investment into their manufacturing infrastructure and customer support base maybe? They should have stuck with their search engine and advertisements.Update:I replaced my Nexus 7 with a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. While it's slightly inferior technology wise, it is also cheaper, and seems to be quite reliable.

tablet|This tablet is amazing! I ended up giving the ipad to my grandma and am now an android fan for life!Buy this tablet, you won't regret it!!!

tablet|Well I never ever regret even one moment that I bought this awesome tabletI'm a big fan of Asus and Google and I can surely tell that they did really a great jop with the nexus tabletEvery aspect of the tablet is amazing and Asus and Google made this tablet perfectThe screen : the most beautiful thing in this tablet so vivid so clear so fully colorful and del ever a huge details of any picture you want , of course Asus is very good in making monitors and they did really a good hop with this screenThe processor : so blazing fast so awesome of course the tegra 3 processor is very good at compiling games so if you are a gamer then this is your tabletThe size : very awesome it can fit my hand immediately and feeling no problem with it , my friends liked it and One of them considering to buy for himself a one awesome nexus tablet .The price : the miracle of the tablet soooo cheap for this impressive deviceAlmost everyone now can buy n awesome tablet thanks Google for aiming thatFrom the begening .The cons :Actually there is not so much cons there is a one small con that I don't like about the tablet that the WiFi sometimes don't get connect immediately especially if the battery is low but but 90% of the times I try to connect with internet it connects immediately and I think the problem is not from the tablet I think its from the modem itselfConclusion :This device is worth not every penny you spend it worth more .

tablet|I love this tablet. I think the 7" size and quad-core raw power together with the low price tag makes this device absolutely perfect for sticking in your everyday bag or purse without the worry I would have had I paid $700 for an iPad or other expensive tablet.The Nexus 7 is FAST thanks to its quad-core processor, and it is perfect for playing games, checking email, and surfing the web. It has built in GPS, which is handy, and the Android Jelly Bean OS means you get all of the latest Android features.Now, what's not so great about it are probably all the things that were taken out to give it the low price point, so you have to balance this with the fact that it starts at under $200 for a supremely well-made device. That being sad...- The front camera on the device is not so great - the picture quality lacks a lot.- There's no back camera at all, which would've been nice to compete with many other tablets out there- The headphone jack DOES NOT include microphone capability - don't expect to use this with a headset for Skype AND you cannot use this tablet with Square or any other credit card reader that uses the headphone.- The WiFi gets wonky sometimes for no reason - just stops working and you have to turn it off and back on - this is rare, but it's happened to me at least twice in the 4 months I've owned it.- Probably because of the new Jelly Bean OS, there are several apps that are compatible with your old Android phone which ARE NOT compatible with this device - for instance, I can't even download the Discover Card or American Express account apps. This is a developer issue, not a device issue, but it's worth pointing out.- There is NO HDMI Port on this device, which would've made it absolutely perfect for taking on vacations and hooking up to a hotel room for watching Netflix etc.With all that said, I still give this thing 5 stars because it is the absolute best bang for your buck that you're going to get in a 7" Android tablet right now.

tablet|You can read reviews all over that tell you the technical abilities of the Nexus 7 but I can tell you that this tablet is a productivity powerhouse. I attended 4 classes online, wrote 2, 6-page papers and commented on 6 discussion questions all using the voice recognition keyboard. Very little editing. The voice typing seems to work better if your typing into a Google Doc, then go and cut n paste where the text belongs. I was looking for a tablet that could replace my notebook computer and the Nexus 7 has done it.The only flaw in the whole device is that it only has 1 usb port. Sucks when you want to charge and hook up the hdmi adapter at the same time. I did test typing with a USB keyboard using the OTG cable and that worked flawlessly.The battery life in the Wi-Fi version is amazing. Getting about 10 to 12 hours screen time. Only about 4 hours playing Grand Theft Auto but you got to figure that burns up some cpu power.

tablet|I recently purchased the 16GB Google Nexus 7 from the Google Play Store. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the iPad and to upgrade my Kindle. No regrets with this purchase! So far, this tablet has lived up to the hype:*Access to all Google products (i.e. Chrome, Talk, Wallet, Google +, etc)*Access to plenty of free Apps through Google Play Store.*Complimentary music and magazine samples.*Front-facing camera.*Light-weight, durable, good color quality*Price-point: Around $200*32GB model available - with or without phone carrier service.I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is seeking a less expensive alternative to the iPad or similar device.

tablet|This garbage machine always locks itself automatic even thogh I am toching it. And I cant unlock it unless close the cover and open again.

tablet|I have had my tabled about two weeks now. I bought it mainly to replace my nook that BN decided to destroy with a bad patch. In addition, it allows me to read at night. Plus it does everything else my phone already does.I have learned that the answer to the question of it being big enough for comfortable web page reading is...Almost. I would probably be at home with a 10" for reading web pages. But for Facebook and for you tube and other videos, this is great! I also use it to take notes at work.The only flaw I have see is that it seems to have an old generation or old technology LCD display. It appears to 'ghost' like LCDs did when they first entered the computer arena several years back. So it is very uncomfortable to follow scrolling text. I don't know if that is the screens fault, or the driver, or what, but it is not comfortable to watch at all. On a desk top you might spin the mouse wheel while you scan the text going by for something specific. Just not a pleasant experience on this tablet.Also, I have to stay annoyed at the limited memory. I plan to use this a lot to highlight my trips by showing pictures and movies but I don't always have an available internet connection so streaming is not a good enough alternative.

tablet|I bought the 16GB tablet before Christmas after reading all the rave reviews. I will say that it was a great size, fit in my jacket pocket and the back pocket of my jeans, but I could still read and watch movies on it with ease. I downloaded a lot of movies and books, and pictures, and I had plenty of memory left. My chief complaint is no white Nexus 7 was available.Another issue: When I tried to download some apps from sources other than the Google Play store, I was initially prevented by the 7's settings. The Google store is the default, but this is annoying. I had to go online to learn how to disable settings to allow me to avoid the Google Play store which I find good, but overrated, and although I have a Google Tablet, I prefer a universe larger than just the Google Play store.Overall, 16GB is plenty of storage for most users. The imagery is very clear. The sound is good. The build quality of the tablet is good. It feels expensive. I have owned 4 tablets, and the Nexus 7 is really a lot for the money. Internet reception was good. Setting up access for my own wifi was easy. Its a really nice tablet, and you get a high end product at a middle price point. Now, they need to make it in white.

tablet|I really wanted to love this tablet. But, I can't get past some fatal flaws. I've been using it for two months now, and here are some observations. I mostly read, surf the internet and watch videos on my tablets.Pros: The interface (Android 4.2) is great. Very customizable with many widgets to add to your desktop/home screen. Love the Google search feature which is available with a simple upward swipe from the bottom of the screen. Great screen resolution. Inexpensive and portable.Cons: The sound is anemic at best. Not much better than the original Kindle Fire. Audio playback from Netflix skips constantly when paired with my Bluetooth headset (very annoying). Wireless is noticeably slower then my iPad and wife's Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Google play videos are slow to load. Reading books and magazines is a joke. There is a significant lag for mags and books to load pages. It's just frustrating. Battery life isn't that great, and then it takes about 6 hours to charge fully.I hate to say it, but I now know why Apple is killing the tablet market. Their machine is simply faster with better resolution and apps. Simply put, if you are going to buy a tablet for videos and books/magazines I would get the Kindle Fire HD (cheaper than an iPad). Amazon's prices are usually less then the competition. If apps, videos, web surfing and reading are important, then get an iPad.

tablet|Now I want one for myself. This is awesome My daughter is a pro. Very easy to navigate and so easy to travel with.

tablet|i got the tablet last fri, i cannot put it down, ive rooted it, installed flash, and its amazing, ive even updated the kernel (franco kernel) and its even smoother and faster now, the slight issue i have is the bezel seems to be lifting a little on the left hand side, even a little light leakage, but its not that bad, i love this tablet and recommend it, as an I.T guy i have to test tablets sometimes, and this one is superb!! 4/5 stars because of the slight lifting of bezel.

tablet|The Kindle Fire was my first tablet and I loved it but when the Nexus 7 was introduced, I was really torn about whether to go with the Google tablet or upgrade my Fire. I love Amazon and am a dedicated shopper but I also love Google and use it for almost everything else.Since my main entertainment activity is reading and I use a Kindle e-ink which is never far from my side, I use the tablet mostly for web browsing, email, google text and voice notifications, google drive documents and mapping. When I weighed the pros and cons of just my most common tablet activities, the Nexus 7 was the logical choice for me.Chrome synchs beautifully between my tablet, desktop and ultrabook. I really love that feature and it is invaluable to me. I don't care about synching my media as much as I do my browsing. I also love the built in GPS and offline mapping ability. Google Now was completely unexpected and it still fascinates me. It looks at my calendar and a card pops up reminding me of an appointment and the travel time in the current traffic pattern.I didn't give it a full five stars because I think the camera should have been a lot better for Skype. Other than that, I just love my Google Nexus 7.

tablet|Google sells this on its website for 200$...so go save 50 dollars and but it straight from google rather than buying it here

tablet|I own or have owned several generations of Kindle Readers, an Acer Iconia A500, Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, Galaxy Player 5.0, Coby Kyros 1024, and... what else? Some Chinese tablets from Pandawill.The screen on this is spectacular in every way. 1280x800 on a 7" panel creates crisp, rich resolution, high pixel density, but still very comfortable to read. Samsung's IPS screen does allow virtually perfect viewing almost all the way to 180 degrees and the colors are just spectacular. Other screens are OK, even good; this is fabulous.The chassis wrapped around the 7" panel is just amazingly compact relative to our 7" Coby Kyros. The Kyros is, of course, and entry-level tablet and this model is a couple of years old. But it is stellar how compact this is. It fits in your hand comfortably. Although brushed metal is sexy, the case on the Nexus is a great soft, rubberized surface that feels really comfortable to hold. Warm and inviting rather than cold and hard. The screen is high-gloss and so, gets plastered in fingerprints pretty quickly. The case avoids that pretty well.The capacitive controls are, as expected on a unit of this quality, absolutely top-notch. The screen is responsive, easy to use, no false positives and no ignored taps.It is truly regrettable that they chose not to include a microSD card slot. This is almost certainly a loss-leader for Google, the pricing is so aggressive. But microSD is not exactly a high-end feature. It's pretty standard even on cut-rate hardware and it's always a source of complaint when it's missing. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 unfortunately suffers the same lack. Don't be like Apple... let us use standard, generic media! Nevertheless, you could theoretically survive with the 8GB model and do pretty well with the 16GB model (which is what I bought). You can't load up your entire music library and half a dozen movies on the thing. But you can load enough. Get the 16GB version if you like movies and music, and for those who are on the fence, maybe they'll release another version in a year that includes the obvious media card slot.What you get, for what you pay for, is still an absolutely stellar deal. It's powerful, fast. The screen is absolutely spectacular. The unit is solid and comfortable to hold. Everything about it just emanates quality, fit and finish. It's great for reading email, sending quick IMs, surfing the web, opening and viewing files, listening to music and watching movies. This is clearly targeted towards the Kindle Fire; with this kind of hardware and based on Android 4.1, it wins. Hands-down. I can't really evaluate the relative amount of content, or prices therefor, in Google Play vs. Amazon App Store, since I don't really do too much buying on either. But the hardware for the Nexus 7 is really top-notch, beats out even more expensive stuff, and the value equation is almost off the charts. All of this for $200-250!Enjoy.

tablet|This thing is absolutely amazing. The jellybean operating system is so smooth and nearly flawless. I would totally recommend this product. Easily the best piece of equipment I've purchased in a while, maybe ever.
---
tablet|Let me start by saying this is my first tablet, though I am in no way ignorant of Android or Google (being a huge fan of both and having owned two Android phones previously). So, with that said here's a breakdown of this 7" beast.HARDWAREThe Nexus 7 is a collaboration by both Google and Asus (my favorite hardware company). Its key features include:+ Corning glass 1280x800 display+ 1.3 GHz quad-core CPU+ Nvidia Tegra 3 GPU+ 1.2 MP front-facing camera+ 1 GB of RAM+ NFC (Android Beam)+ Gyroscope+ Accelerometer+ 8/16 GB of storage (can plug in USB drives if device is rooted)The display is very nice for a 7" tablet. The Transformer Infinity has a 1920x1200 display, but it's also 10.1" meaning it's easier to distinguish. Larger screens make the difference so the resolution for the Nexus 7 is fine and looks sharp. The quad-core CPU is really nice as transitions and page loading very fast (this being helped more by Jelly Bean). This also helps make games run smoother as well as GPU power. The camera is nice as well, though there is no camera app installed at stock (simply download it from the Play Store and it works fine). The only real downside hardware-wise is the little amount of storage space. Being an avid Android enthusiast, I often need space to play around with. However, if you root the Nexus 7, you can plug in flash drives and external hard drives (simply buy an OTG cable and downlad StickMount from the Play Store). The feel of the tablet itself is great. It's very light and the back is rubbery, but comfortable to hold for hours on end.SOFTWAREThe Nexus 7 is a Google tablet, meaning it comes with the latest version of Android 4.1.1 (Jelly Bean) out of the box. This also means that it will have constant support and will always receive updates to the latest Android versions first (and if you're a flasher like me the community for modding it is great). This is my first Nexus device and from what I've seen of the Nexus 7, I intend to have all of my future devices be Nexus as well. Jelly Bean is an extreme improvement over ICS. I won't go into extreme detail as there are reviews on Jelly Bean, but its fast, responsive and smooth (mainly do to Project Butter).OVERALLA definite buy in my opinion. With only a $200 price tag on Google Play ($250 for the 16 GB model), it's a steal and beats out the competition such as the Kindle Fire. True, Apple will most likely unveil the iPad Mini in the coming months, but it's doubtful the price tag will equal this and if it does, its specs will probably be nowhere near as good. Nexus is a constantly evolving brand and this latest installment is a must have for anyone.

tablet|I love this tab the display is off the chain .my previous tab were an iPad 1 and a Samsung galaxy 7.this tablet everything loads faster and I don't have it freezing like my galaxy tab did a lot.I bought the 8gb that might not be enough memory for most pppeople but all the books and movies are on the cloud so that's a memory saver .the lack of a rear camera might be a deal breaker for Some people but any picture you take with your phone and if you have a Google plus account will be on there anyway.over all this is my favorite tablet ever until the nexus 10 comes out.
---
tablet|I've owned many tablets. Acer Iconia a500, a100, Transform Pad 300, HP Touchpad, iPad 2, RIM Playbook (and others).I ordered the Nexus 7, the second they displayed it at Google I/O. Everything during their presentation works well on the Nexus 7. Google Voice Search, Google Now (updates me on traffic to and from work, and gives me the current results of my favorite sports teams and more). Google delivered everything they said the Nexus would do.Expandable storage is not an issue for me. I got the 16GB Nexus, and have yet to fill up the device, even with large games like Nova 3 and Modern Warfare and Shadow Gun. And all these games play great, WITHOUT lag. I even use my PS3 controller (w/OTG cable) to play them. It's nice to have a physical controller instead of screen controls sometimes.The device is really portable, and though it does stick out a little, it fits easily within a jacket pocket or back pocket on my jeans. Yep, I take it nearly everywhere with me. When I need internet, most places I frequent for a sit down, has wifi. And when all else fails, I tether it to my smartphone, for what I need. (For an hour of 4G internet, it uses about 10 - 15% of my phone battery).I can keep going on, but here's the link to my Youtube Review of the Nexus 7. So you can see what I really thought of it:Amazon won't let me post a link, so if you're interested, just search AhmazinSKM on Youtube.

From what several have said it should work fairly easily and give you 500 GB of storage, enough to store 300 movies, etc. It can also be accessed by up to three devices at a time. For $165, it could work out well choosing the 8 GB and having the saved $50 go toward that bad boy.Just a thought.

tablet|I purchased the Google Nexus 7 16GB tablet from the local wholesale club and highly recommend it.The hardware build quality is excellent and the texture on the back is indeed like nice gloves providing a nice grip. It has nice light feel. I found the screen to be better than the G-Nexus phone in terms of viewing angle and crispness. The overall feel of tablet seems more solid than the phone. The speaker and camera are pretty good. Battery life is about 7-8 hrs in my experience. It is built by Asus for Google and they have been a pioneer in netbooks.The Jelly Bean operating system is very fluid and compares easily to the iPad, since there are lot of the same major apps and media content in the Play store. The tablet has a navigation app with built in GPS hardware, but requires a data connection to use while on the move, so you will need to tether to a phone. Google has many interesting new features in their system for searches. The search cards are elegant and show a lot of polish. It would be nice for Google to make other basic elements (contacts, calendar, email) of their OS that elegant. Updates come directly from Google also, so there is no third party. You get the latest release as soon as it starts and connects to the wifi.Overall, this is a well made, easy to use tablet that exceeded my expectations.

tablet|An affordable 7" tablet, with a better screen than the current iPad mini, at a much lower price. Great for browsing, a reader, Netflix viewing, games, etc. Only complaint is the faux-metal silver paint around the plastic frame, which is chipping/peeling, even with delicate handling.

tablet|I revived my first nexus 7 16 gb for Christmas. I noticed it had a circular mark on the screen that wouldn't come off with cleaning. I'd describe it as similar to the mark a GPS suction cup mount leaves on a car windshield. You can feel it with your fingers, it feels rough in that spot. I read there are a considerable amount of others who have had this issue with their brand new Nexus 7 device.So I returned it to where it was bought, but they didn't have anymore in stock, so they ordered me another one. About 1 week later I received the new one, and it had the same issue. I called the store, they dont carry the 16 gb version anymore so all they can do is order me another one or refund my money. I called google, they couldn't help because I didn't buy it from google play store. They referred me to Asus, who offered to repair it if I sent it in. Repair it? It's brand new!At no point could anyone explain why both devices had this annoying mark. My guess: the suction cup mark is from The manufacturing process, maybe it was being held by a machine before the anti scratch coating sufficiently dried. I have to imagine a large batch of these devices with this blemish are getting through QC, probably because you don't notice it until you begin to get some finger prints on the screen (which only happens after some use).I don't want to deal with this anymore, and I especially don't want to wait for another week or more to find out my third device has the same issue. I'd gladly accept another one, if I could check it first before I gave this one back, but nobody will help me with that. I like the device enough (which is why I gave it 2 stars and not 1) but who wants a brand new tablet with a big blemish on the screen?So, I'll probably get a refund and try a different brand. IMO the proper way to handle this would be for someone to offer to personally check that the new device they will send me DOESN'T have the blemish, but I cannot get a hold of anyone (be it ASUS, Google, or the store I bought it from) who will work with me on this. That doesn't make me feel very good about my purchase, especially toward ASUS and Google.

tablet|I have had a Nook Color (returned within 14 days) and an LG G-Slate (kept, but didn't love). For my birthday my husband got me a new Kindle Fire, which I expected to love, since I've loved every Kindle I've had up to that point. But it really wasn't versatile enough for me, and I sent it back and ordered the Google Nexus 7 instead.As soon as I got it connected, there was a software update. This is huge for me, because LG never, ever, ever updates. Literally, I never had a single update on the G-Slate the entire time I had it. Since October (2 months ago now) Google has sent out 2 system updates. I'm very happy that they keep things current. The tablet is very fast, and I haven't had to deal with a lot of crashing or apps that won't work. The tablet itself feels high quality. The screen is responsive, and everything works the way it's supposed to.There are only a couple of negatives. One is that it doesn't have an SD slot, so you can't expand the storage. I don't expect it to be a huge problem since it has a decent amount of internal memory, but it would be nice to have the option to expand.Another is that you can't do ANYTHING until you connect to the internet. My home internet was set up so that you had to enter an item's wifi MAC address before it could connect. But you literally could not do a single thing with the tablet until it connected. I had to change the settings on my home internet connection to not require the MAC address, so I could connect to it and get in to find the MAC address. This is a big design flaw in my opinion. Of all the devices I've ever had (a lot!), I've never had one that would trap you in the set-up until you get it online.Overall, this tablet is a great value. I expect it to work well for a long time.

tablet|Wow ..... I love this tablet. It does everything including Kindle books and Amazon movies. It is faster than my wife's new Ipad. I got mine at Staples for 199. Obviously Amazon is protecting its Kindle tablet by not offering the Nexus 7 at a competitive price.
---
tablet|I bought it because I wanted an Android device and didn't want a large tablet, so this was the perfect combination. I've been using it for over a month and it has replaced all my apps on my iphone (except for a few essential ones). Great screen, perfect for streaming movies and TV shows. I use it for everything from email to news reading to games.

tablet|Overall, the quality of the Nexus 7 is very nice. It looks and feels great, good enough to be the best 7 inch tablet on the market. I believe it is, however some things keep it from being the best tablet, period. The UI can take a little time to get used to - having both widgets and apps on the same screen(s). It is very simple to customize and does give the user plenty of options to tweak. Both Bluetooth and WiFi are available options as far as connectivity and you can upload and stream your songs over WiFi, yet the whole process seems clunky and unnecessary. Putting songs onto the tablet by copying over into the files while connected to the computer with the included USB cable is not only a lot simpler, but it allows for you to play your songs without being connected to WiFi. You can play these songs or watch videos and listen to them through the speaker or try to connect headphones/earbuds to the 3.5mm jack, although doing that doesn't seem to work. I have tried to connect multiple things through the auxiliary port of the Nexus 7, but nothing seems to work unless you get it just right. Even without the ability to get exceptional audio quality with the Nexus 7, the video quality surpasses many tablets of the same size. With an impressive 1280x800 resolution, text, pictures, and videos all look crystal clear. As well, games can look stunning as well.The Google store doesn't boast quite the selection that you can get from the iTunes store but you can still find some great apps and hours of entertainment. Downloading and updating these apps is very simple and the style and UI can make it easy to find what you're looking for, as well as difficult. There aren't too many subcategories to find something sometimes and the search feature is lacking features as you are forced to search the entirety of the store and cannot choose another way.Speed is something that has been advertised with the Nexus 7 and it does have quite a bit. Everything loads and can be accessed quickly without too much hassle, and everything currently in the cache can be seen by simply pressing a button at the bottom of the screen. The experience throughout is something to not be overlooked. Compared to the Nook HD, the Kindle Fire HD, ans the iPad mini, the Nexus 7 is a step ahead. Though some of it's features can see unneeded or frivolous at times, Google and Asus added plenty more good than bad to make the Nexus 7 probably the best 7 inch tablet for a good price. (And from a buyer's standpoint, it's cheaper directly through Google.)

tablet|I bought this for my wife. She has an I phone 4s. I was concerned that the different operating system would challenge her technological ability. No worries. She made the change just fine with a little help from the kids and you tube- adding the camera app. Great resolution, easy to use. Good size.

tablet|The Google Nexus is a superior product and this came quickly and easily. I would definltely recommend both to anyone looking for an easy to use google product.

tablet|Bought this because a tech rep at Google said it worked with Square (credit card processor), but pants on fire, it does not. I went with an ipod touch because of a last minute trade show opportunity, so I sent the Nexus back. I only got to use the Nexus for a day, but I loved it. Perfect size screen - everything... My kid has taken ownership of a $300 pc of status symbol - ipod - and I'm left over here singing the blues. Bummer. Soon as I can afford it, I want my Nexus back!

tablet|As an owner of many iOS devices and now a few Android, I rate this tablet very high. It is lightweight, has a beautiful screen and the OS is very smooth. The only downside is the lack of compatibility of certain apps. Unlike the iPad, which will run all apps from Apple, the Nexus 7 will not run certain apps on Google Play that are designed for phones. There are several apps now that I use frequently on my iPhone that aren't available for this. However, this slight inconvenience is the tradeoff in price premium for an iPad.

tablet|I have been an Apple fan for years . . . still love their products.This sweet little tablet is ideal for me! It is crisp and clear and everything I use and want is there. I never thought I would see the day when I would appreciate the ease and convenience of email on a tablet, but with this Nexus it is sooooo convenient. Although I have two-level security, it works seamlessly on this and I never have to think about it.If there's an easier, better way to accomplish something then it has been done here.I love that I can put a message on the screen, so if it's lost whoever finds it immediately knows how to contact me. I'll be searching for a "find your Nexus" app similar to the "find your iPhone" app.I have a Kindle - one of the early Kindles and have really, truly enjoyed it. Reading on the Nexus is a whole different experience, as I suppose it could be on the newest Kindle. Early on, I was page turning as you would in a physical book. Then I stumbled on turning the page by a light tap on the right side to move forward and the left side to move backward. That's a nice feature.So far, I've watched part of a movie, read a book and part of another, listened to music, enjoyed Internet access wherever there's wi-fi and played games (of course). My grandchildren accessed my games and far outstripped me on my iTouch early on, so this has been fun to come up through the levels myself.Another fabulous feature is the ability to segregate out space for anyone. They can experience their own progression without infringing on each other or me.This little tablet is small enough to go anywhere with me and so handy! It's a winner!

tablet|It is a great tablet at a great price point. Specially to replace a cumbersome laptop, she carries it i her purse and is ready to go.

tablet|the 1st tablet owned, but I had borrowed a 10" older no name brand whith Andriod 2.0 which was alright, but this Nexus blows it out of the water.1st off, YES, you can use a USB external hard drive. You need a USB 2 go adaptor and an App like ES file Explorer.Also, when you plug the USB cable into your computer, you will be able to transfer files easily.The speed and responsiveness of the screen and operating system Andriod 4.1 is instantaneous and easy to navigate.Sound is great with headphones and I was impressed with the native speakers. I didn't think they would be so loud and clear with such a small device.The size of this is great. It fits easily into a cargo pocket.Video and games look great!The one thing that annoys me is that there is about a half inch unused space all around the screen. Why? Why not either make the entire thing smaller or increase the screen to hit almost the edge of the device.It really does annoy the heck out of me, but...for the price, size and functionality, it's not a dealbreaker.

tablet|The nexus 7 is a near revolutionary device and portable entertainment center that can fit in your pocket (albeit tightly and in a larger size type pocket). I mainly use it for e-reading and if anyone ever wanted to get into this new way of reading then I highly recommend the nexus. A beautiful display is a pleasure to look at and use, and the storage is ample in the 16GB version. I have been using the nexus for a month or so, putting e-books and some games on it, and I still have half of the storage space left. And one of my games is almost 2GB in size and I hardly ever play it, but if you think you might like some extra storage space then I suggest getting the new 32GB model that was recently released.I have had no problems with any build quality issues, and am constantly using my new "toy" everywhere I go. If you have a mobile internet service in your area then the nexus really comes into its own as a portable internet browsing computer. On the downside, I will say a previous review that talked about the mediocre audio speaker is correct. Even at the max volume it can be hard to hear the sound when watching movies or youtube. However an easy fix is to buy a portable speaker like I recently did (the x-mini II) which should solve that problem. I think everyone who is thinking about getting a tablet should consider getting the Nexus 7!

tablet|I have been on the fence about tablets for awhile, but always kept a close eye on the Fire since it came out last year. As an early adopter of Google's Nexus devices (I still use my Nexus One phone, although as a travel phone now), I was impressed in the "bare bones" Android operating system and its flexibility to do what I want it to do, not what the hardware provider wants me to see.Two points that I would give to anyone looking at this tablet, since, like me, I assume people read these things to see whats wrong with a product:1) There is not a native rotation control in the operating system. I have found several apps in the Play store to give this control, some free, but the best was $2.99 for life. I'm sure that this oversight will be corrected at some point in the development and my $2.99 app will be worthless, but, hey, its $3 and I haven't found much else out there that I need to pay for (great thing about the Play store, most apps are free if you don't mind stupid advertising).2) There is no mobile data available, but I use the Bluetooth tethering from my phone (HTC One S) and get great connection. It depends of course on your data plan, but my T-Mobile plan has free tethering and unlimited data (although capped on 4G). Unless you really need to be checking email or any other activity "in the wild", the WiFi only will be sufficient for most people.Overall, a great product that I would recommend to just about anyone.

tablet|I bought the 16Gb model for my wife and she loves it. Android 4.1.1 (jellybean) is an improvement over earlier versions. The interface is intuitive and it works great and once I supplied the encryption seed word, it translated and encrypted it in seconds and we were up and running on the Wifi in moments. There are a multitude of apps available and and the screen resolution and battery life are superior to the Kindle Fire. This is an excellent product in its price range.Which brings me to my point that Amazon is selling both the 8Gb and the 16Gb at above the suggested retail price of $199.99 & $249.99 respectively for no apparent reason other than perhaps that this product is a direct competitor to their own Kindle Fire and may cut into their sales. If this is their reasoning then this is unfortunate, and is this the kind of image that Amazon wants to present?It would seem to have been far more upfront if they either marketed it at the suggested list price or not carried it all. Another thought might be to drop the price of the Fire to make it more attractive. Competition will always exist and how one deals with it says much. Why not upgrade the Kindle Fire if they feel threatened?

tablet|I am having the same problems that are widely reported all over the web. Just search for Nexus 7 issues and 1000's of pages come up. Right out of the box the touch screen would become unresponsive after 5-10 min of light use. A reboot would fix the issue for 5-10 min. I could live with that. After 3 week of minor use I noticed the screen is separating for the unit. I look it up online and this is also another major problem. Seems like every batch was not glued in correctly so when the screen gets hot, it starts to loosen up the glue. Very disappointed that one of the few companies that I was a die-hard follower to put out a product like this.

tablet|Since tablets became popular, I was very hesitant to buy one. I have a desktop, a MacBook Pro, and an iPhone. Why would I need another device? Apple's iPad was too large, expensive, and not as functional to replace my laptop and all of the other tablets I tried instore seemed slow, laggy, and poorly made. After Apple released the iPad mini, I became interested in tablets again only to find out that the mini has a lower resolution screen, no GPS, and outdated hardware. I read a review mentioning the Nexus 7 so I did a little research. High resolution screen, GPS, fast processor, lots of good reviews, and $80 cheaper than the iPad Mini. Since the life cycle of tablets is very short, 7 months in the case of the iPad 3, I couldn't justify paying over $300 for semi-disposable electronics. $250 for the 16gb model, sold. I did not buy it from Amazon though, the price is about $17 higher here than other places, just a heads up.The packaging is professional and apple-esque, first impression of the tablet is that it looked like a giant iPhone 3G. The glass is very smooth and not sticky. For some reason the Samsung Galaxy's glass feels more like sticky plastic to me. The screen is clear and bright and the tablet is light but sturdy at the same time. The back feels like rubberized plastic which is nice considering it wont scratch or dent as easily as the competitors tablet. Coming from iOS and never using Android before, it took me about 5 minutes to learn how to use it. Everything runs buttery smooth, no lag like other tablets I played with. As with any new device, first thing I did was search for applications. The Google Play store is NOT as large as the App Store, but it has all of the most popular apps. Coming from the brain washed iOS ecosystem, I didn't immediately realize I could install apps from outside sources. That is a huge plus! I dug a little further and wanted to transfer some music from my Macbook to the N7. No problem, it is USB right? Wrong. Of course, Apple does not recognize the N7 so you need to use Android File Transfer to move files around. Small inconvenience, but MUCH easier than iTunes sycning BS. Then I discovered Airdroid. Hands down it is the most useful app, it is essentially a browser based tablet manager. It even allows you to install applications from outside sources. Apple would never allow that! At this point it feels like spending the night at your friends house whose awesome parents don't care if you stay up past your bed time or don't finish all of your vegetables.At this point, I am convinced I will never buy another iOS device again. The ability to do simple things such as send/receive files over Bluetooth without a jailbreak, fully customize the user interface, or even move my app icons into a non grid pattern make me feel like I just turned 18 again. What else can it do? I was able to install Google Voice, connect it to my iPhone and now I have the ability to text using my Sprint phone number. I installed Dropbox, got another 500mb of storage for free and then discovered you can upload files - in iOS, you have to have the creepy geotagging feature enabled on the camera app to upload only certain things to Dropbox. In short, there is a lot more you can do with the N7 than any iOS based device. Even simple things like having live wallpapers makes the experience much more enjoyable.The battery life is also great. I have used it for about 6 hours now and I still have 25% battery life left. Charging does take a while though and it charges best with a short cable. It's the only real annoying thing about the tablet but it does have a huge battery.Now, things I don't like about it. There are not any pretty keyboards like the smart cover on the Surface or iPad and cases in general for the N7 seem to be all plain faux leather portfolio type. I don't see a lot of docking accessories like the iPad has but that isn't a deal breaker for me. The speaker is also pretty weak. It is on the back and faces away which is a little awkward but it gets the job done for the most part. I would use headphones to watch a movie with it though. The camera is also junk to be honest. It is good for skype and that is about it. You need a 3rd party app to record or take pictures. But the GPS and NFC both make up for those short comings.I am very happy with the Nexus 7, it is small enough to fill the gap between laptop and smart phone but not try to replace either. The price is right and the quality is great. In fact, running Android has made me a full convert from iOS. It also makes a great navigation aid in the car!Edit: I have been using the tablet daily since I have got it. When I switch back to my $1600 3.4ghz i7 based gaming machine, it feels clunky and slow. It sounds weird but you don't realize how much time you spend moving the mouse around to click stuff. Being able to just tap it makes web browsing much faster. Coming from iOS, it takes a while to get used to the keyboard. In fact, I found the stock keyboard infuriating so I replaced it with Swift Key 3. The more you use it, the better it gets. It eventually gets to the point where it will predict chunks of sentences. Another minor irritating thing is Gmail and the stock Email application. While it is quick, they do not allow you to view mail full screen. A chunk of the tabs take up 1/3 of the screen in land scape mode so you need to move the message around to read it. It's nothing a software update can fix though.As of right now, I have the N7 in my car tethered to my iPhone for internet and the N7 connects to my car's stereo and OBD2 port with bluetooth. It provides navigation, lets me listen to Pandora or my own music, and Torque Pro gives me a read out of everything from MPG to fluid temperatures. It is nearly impossible to get that same functionality out of an iPad mini and an iPhone that isn't jailbroken.I have not had buyers remorse after getting this tablet. I did return my 16gb version and got the 32gb right after it came out though. As my review title says, it fills a gap I never knew was there. Being able to use it to do everything from playing Angry Birds to car diagnostics with intuitive simplicity has made me a convert to Android.

tablet|I will be frank with this review, I am not going to repeat what others have said in their reviews about this tablet. Me too, have had just about every tablet that has benn made in the last two years. For me this 7" tablet represents portability. I can stick it in my Cargo Pants lower pocket when traveling. I use it mainly for checking my emails, and to browse the internet to get air tickets, rent a car and hotels, not to mention extensive search for restaurants and points of interest using Google Map. I use it a lot to get my hotel room from priceline. So, I am able to log on from almost any WiFi location.That said: My 16gb storage is plenty for me, the screen is sharp. Although I keep the brightness around 50%, and use the Android App Killer all the time, I don't see the battery lasting more than8-9 hrs. As a matter of fact the first hour of use, it kills about 1/3 battery energy. I guess the percentage shown is just theoretical, as it is dependant on accuracy of the microchip. Then depending how I use it thereafter. Normally cruising the net, checking emails, playing a couple of games for 1-2 hrs. It will last another 6-7 hrs.WiFi, I get pretty decent connection, but just like with my Toshiba Thrive or with the IPad. Incidentally, I would never compare this with the IPad 2 or 3. At home I use a Lynksis E3000 router which has proven to work very well with all my computers and tablets, coupled with high speed internet cable, I have no complaints. The bottom line is that at $282 from Google Play store (this included tax and shipping) I am not complaining. So, I say: Get one!

tablet|The Nexus 7 is a sleeper. Good features,clean usage....more mistake free keys than Apple. I like using it almost exclusively for lengthy e-mails. Herb B. Jupiter, FL

tablet|The current price for this item is 200 for a 16gb and 32gb which you can find at walmart or google store. The reason it is overpriced is because Amazon itself will not stock the Nexus because of the Kindle Fire. You are buying indirectly from a third party merchant. Kudos to Amazon for allowing it to be sold on their site, but it is unwise for any consumer.As for the Nexus 7, it is great. It is very open-ended, not like an ipad, and runs flawlessly.
---
tablet|Really my only reservation is that it has a lousy camera, no memory expansion, and run-of-the-mill battery life, otherwise, the Nexus 7 seems about perfect. It is fast and reliable, has a great screen, decent sound, gps, a pretty powerful wireless adapter. It runs the latest Android. Google Chrome and email connectivity is frankly better than my laptop. The battery life is fine, but nothing to brag about. Oh... I would love an hdmi out, but that's a quibble. And perhaps the screen is just a little too bright for reading in the middle of the night in a dark room (but you can set it to have a dark screen to account for that).
---
tablet|First off, Google just updated the Nexus 7 to 16GB for the $199 version, 32GB for $249, and will have a 32GB + cellular radio version for $299. Don't pay more than that for it (like this listing as of 11/23/12 when writing this review.)This is a killer tablet for $200. The screen is nice, 16GB storage is plenty (about 13GB actually free), it's light, and it has clean lines. The back has a rubberized & dimpled texture that helps gripping it. Mine came with Android 4.1 and quickly updated to 4.2, and the "Nexus" devices have the best update support. It runs full Android, 1280x800 screen, good processor - so you can do most anything with it. Any use you have a question about, just search Google play and see what's there before buying.On the downside, the one bottom speaker is fairly weak. When laying on a flat surface the sound reflects up to you, which helps, but otherwise it isn't loud. There's no rear camera, but tablets have awful cameras and you won't miss it (your smartphone has a better camera anyhow).To picture how it will be in your hand, pick up a standard DVD case. The Nexus 7 is very slightly taller, about 1" narrower, and half the thickness (but the back is curved so edges are thinner). It fits comfortably in one hand, gripped by the long edges in portrait.Highly recommended. If you're unsure and want to "try out this tablet stuff" this is perfect. If you want to take it with you everywhere, also great (light and not so $$ that it will super hurt if lost or destroyed - but get a case anyhow ;).

tablet|Bought the Nexus 32GB from Office Depot 3 Nov 12 ($250) to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab that was pushing 2 years old. The Sammy was good, but this is fabulous. Seamless use for over a week, no issues other than fast pleasure. Keeping the Sammy as a backup, but the Nexus 7 and Android 4.1 take the prize!

tablet|I have an Archos tablet that I love. I'm an Android geek, I should confess, and I kept wondering if I wanted to get a Nexus with straight-up clean Android on it. It was no real debate ... I ordered the Nexus 7 over the weekend and it arrived yesterday, and I stayed up all night playing with it. I love it. It sounds great, it feels great, it looks great. The rubber backing feels comfortable and it weighs nothing. Picture quality great. The processor kick *ss, and it really does flow from one thing to another without any pause or lag. Videos are a joy. Reading is good (although I want to read on a larger screen usually; the plus side of this tablet is that even pdf's of old books are legible because of the intense clarity of the screen). If you love Android and you live in the Google ecosystem, you just turn on the machine, sign in and you've got hundreds of apps and everything syncs up effortlessly. Tell me that this thing is gonna upgrade to 4.2 and I'll probably die of happiness. Seriously, this is one great little piece of equipment. I love it.

tablet|Okay, the only reason why I got a Nexus 7 was because I was incredibly disappointed with the Kindle Fire HD. I was given the first generation Kindle Fire last year as a gift and I couldn't be more happy with it. BUT, the gripes with the Kindle Fire using a 'custom' Android version was very limiting. So I thought that getting a Kindle Fire HD would be a bit of an upgrade. But it's basically the same tablet with a slightly faster CPU, a tad better screen and better speaker locations. But aside from that, very limited to the Amazon appstore and the custom Android system on it. Also, being limited to only Amazon's app store felt little too much like Apple's stranglehold on their customers to use only apps from their Apple Store. Hence, I returned the Kindle Fire HD and got the Nexus 7. First thing off the bat is that it is FAST. The combination of a quad-core CPU along with Jellybean 4.1 is a noticeable difference compared to the Kindle Fire HD's 'custom' Android 4.0 Ice Cream. I got the 16gb version because a friend of mine got the 8gb version and right off the bat, 4gb is used up by the tablet, leaving you with actually about 4gb. So, getting the 16gb resulted in 12gb+ of actual usage. I downloaded the Kindle app for the Nexus 7 and it's basically the same app for the Kindle Fire HD. My only gripe with the Nexus 7 is that there is no microSD slot and no HDMI out. The screen is beautiful. So far, the best screen I've seen on a mini tablet is the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 (Amoled Screen). But side by side, I saw little difference between the screens for the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HD. The speakers are so so on the Nexus 7, yet, I mainly use earphones whenever I listen to anything on any tablet. For $199 (8gb), it definitely is the best mini tablet out there. I'm sure that Apple will step up its game by releasing their mini iPad to counter this gem. We shall see.

tablet|I have a nexus 7 16 gb bought in Italy. The tablet features a Tegra 3 quad core processor and it really shows all his potential. The games run with a good fluidity. Surfing the Internet is very simple and enjoyable with the browser chrome and even video calls with Skype are of excellent quality. Everyone is talking about amazon ecosystem of which I'm a big fan too, but I must say that the eco system google has nothing to envy because all you need is a gmail account and you are in. Google maps, google music, play store, all calendar syncs flawlessly with Android and other devices and also with my computer chromebox. On the hardware side it must be said that the tablet is well built any kind of crackles, very handy and above all perfectly balanced. The biggest flaw is that perhaps does not have the HDMI port, while the lack of rear camera and slot for micro sd card is not so important for me. 16 gb of space are good for me, as the operating system memory is Android 4.1 .1 jelly beans does not occupy much space.In conclusion a great tablet that is good to any situation and especially has a great screen visibility from all angles.

tablet|I've had my Nexus 7 for a month or so and I really like it, Web surfing is nice and snappy, and I love jellybean it's smooth and we'll designed. My major complaints are the lack of Adobe Flash, the stock keyboard could be better and I wish I had a micro SD or regular SD slot, and but for the price its a great deal. I use it quite a bit and haven't had any issues. I like the magnetometer too it allows for smart cases which automatically turn the screen on and off when the screen is uncovered/ covered.

tablet|I got the nexus a week ago, and all in all I like it a lot.PROSUNBEATABLE RATIO PRICE/PERFORMANCESfast... Android 4.1 seems to run very well,good battery life, with intense it lasts one day, if you don't use it ALL THE TIME, at the end of the day you still have about 30-40% left battery.... very goodthe app market has plenty of choice and you can configure the device as you wantthe power cord is a regular micro USB cord, no proprietary stuff... (unlike Samsung and naturally Apple)I like the 7" better than the 10", it fits in my small bag, it is naturally way lighter than the 10" but at the same time if you want to watch a movie on a plane or read a magazine or a ebook you can do that...CONS16 GB, today, are not that much, and it is not expandable (it does not have a card slot, bummer), but honestly you can download and cancel stuff like it was a memory stick, so easy and straightforward (unlike the IPad...)the wifi reception could be better. Compared with my laptop which always read excellent coverage in my apartment, the Nexus is excellent only when I am relatively close to the router. That said, I've never lost the connection, and apparently it does not slow down if it less that perfect, so again, it may be only a "perception"...The speaker sucks. I am sorry but this is my biggest complain. If you are in a live environment (not at home at night with no background noise whatsoever), it is almost impossible to use the device without hear-buds or headphones, which pairs with my next one..., but why these devices (all of them) does not have a mic plug in? When you use it for skype (which works very well), and again you are in a live environment with background noise, you need to keep the tablet close to your mouth, if you want the other to understand you... not convenient...Don't be scared by the fact that the cons section appears to be longer than the pros section. I am very satisfied by the Nexus 7, I like it better over the IPad III, it is smaller, lighter, as fast as the IPad and I can do exactly the same things without having to use exclusively Apple accessories and/or Apple software...Rev.Apparently the audio volume issue is related to some websites only and unfortunately Skype. The audio volume with Skype is extremely low and the audio settings seem not to work, which means you have to use the headphones all the time. That said, if you use the headphones works well..

tablet|I absolutely love this tablet. I own a first gen iPad & Galaxy s2 (i777)..& I cannot put my Nexus 7 down! The display is great & the Jelly Bean OS runs beautifully, very fast & smooth. The battery lasts me all day & I use this quite heavily throughout the day. I also like the size better than 10 inch tablets, it feels good in your hands and its not too heavy or bulky to hold.I am very happy with my purchase. And what made it even better was an app I bought in the Play Store called Tablet Talk. You install this on both your tablet and Android phone, it connects both by via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.. this allows you to send and receive text messages on your Nexus 7 or any Android tablet using your actual cell phone number. Now I don't even have to pick up my cell.. well except for to answer calls!

tablet|This is my first tablet and I am glad I purchased the Nexus7. It is a solid built piece of hardware that has amazing software. It acts un-android like by never force closing and having zero latency. I have downloaded a few games and they look just purely amazing and play perfectly. I also love the simplicity of the Play Apps and absolutely love the Chrome browser. Never had I thought I could use desktop web pages on a tablet but you sure can with this one. The only con I believe is that you can only use the charger that came in the box to charge this tablet I believe, as I used other ones and while it charges, it does at an extremely low slow rate. Otherwise, amazing tablet, amazing price, and would recommend to anybody wanting to delve into the tablet world, its ultra portable and not too big like the iPad or any 10 inch tablet.

tablet|I just got my Nexus 7 last week (from Google store, sadly Amazon is intentionally overpricing this device here or i would have spent my money with Amazon)and after a week here are my thoughts on it and the Fire and Nook.I had been considering an iPad for sometime but just couldnt justify that kind of money for a tablet. A 10 inch tablet is to big in my opinion I wanted something more portable.In my opinion neither the fire or the nook were viable options. I wanted a full fledge tablet not a media consumption device locked into one retailer. (Though I am a loyal amazon user and prime subscriber) I can get both nook and amazon media on this device if I want. All of the features on the nexus mentioned in the other reviews are awesome no need to drone on about those, the GPS was a Deal Maker for me, I wanted maps.The only negatives of the Nexus are lack of memory expansion and rear facing camera. The camera was a non issue for me as I dont see the need to take pictures with a tablet. The memory issue is not insignificant. I got the 16gb version but still I already expect to have issuse downloading several movies for watching on the plane.I got myself comfortable with this issue in the following ways;-Android no longer allows you to save/use apps on external memory, external memory can really only be used for media and even that has some complications for DRM protected media-There area number of external media devices that I think will work for my needs, the wi-drive is one of them, essentially creating cloud storage where ever you are.-For this price it has everything else I wanted and if next year something better comes along I only spent $250 and wont feel terrible having to upgrade.One last note, on the FLASH issue many are raising. It is here to stay, no more FLASH. It isnt a device related issue it is Android and Adobe, both no longer will support it. It works with your Fire today but the OS on that device will likely not receive an OS update. If you want a new device it wont support FLASH.(if the new FIRE supports Flash the OS will be obsolete before it ships) On the nexus there are ways to get it working through other browsers like puffin etc.I am so far very happy with this device and to repeat another review I read, it is the first device I pickup in the morning and the last device I put down at night.

tablet|All I can say is this Tablet has far exceeded my expectations. The screen is super responsive. The speed is excellent. The weight,feel and look is just amazing. I am currently using an LG G2X as my phone, I wanted to upgrade to jelly bean without replacing my phone. For the price tag you can't find a better tablet. I picked mine up at Walmart for 249.99! Nexus 7 16GB

tablet|It's November 28, and after perusing through seven of the 32 pages of Amazon reviews for this Nexus 7, I at first made a decision to buy the Nexus 7, and then ultimately decided to back off. I will share what I learned, filtered of course through one person's perspective. Keep in mind that I am a tablet neophyte, and I would underscore that there are many many fine reviews here worth reading. It's just that a distinct pattern emerges as you plough through the reviews, and this review will hopefully distill some of that.Here is my decision tree on buying my very first tablet:A) The iPad is out. Three reasons;1) PRICE. Outside my budget, plus the models roll over so quickly it seems more prudent to go cheaper if possible and avoid the financial pain of upgrading to the next generation of must have features ;>. And it's hard to pass forking out for those new models when Apple has now dropped support for the original iPad, introduced all the way clear back in 2010.2) The Apple MAFIA (which some call the `ecosystem' or `club'), is the most tightly controlled of the three major platforms (Apple, Amazon, Android). Once you join the Apple mafia it's all Apple all the time. I just saw a documentary on companies that have spent mass quantities of dollars to develop an app which follows the tightly controlled App Store's guidelines, only to have Apple not approve the app for over two years, and not have the courtesy to even say why.3) One word: FOXCONN. When a company sources from a manufacturing facility that must string anti-suicide nets around the buildings to keep despondent employees from terminating their existence, while Apple at the same time makes enough money off the labor of those employees to be able to sock away 100 billion dollars in the bank, and send its stock to the moon... something is wrong. This is a very politically incorrect issue to raise these days, yet the simple truth is that cool iPhones, iPads and other Apple gadgets are making the lives of some people more comfortable at the expense of making others miserable. After seeing the videos (search Youtube on "foxconn suicide nets") I made a decision to not purchase from Apple until the human rights situation at its factories improves).B) The Kindle is out. Although Amazon employs the more open Android OS, since it uses a heavily modified older version of that OS, you are restricted on what apps you can use. It doesn't run all the Android apps. I want a more open solution. For example, I live in the boonies and my employer doesn't have Direct Deposit. Most of the big banks now have an app that let's you scan your check with your smartphone or tablet regardless of your location, and have the check instantly deposited in your account. My bank is due to implement an Android app for this service shorlty. Do I want to buy a Kindle and cross my fingers that the Android version of that app will run on a Kindle? Of course not. The latest Kindle Fire HD has a crippled GPS chip and USB port so you can't use it for localization or navigation, and you can't even plug an external GPS product (or many other USB based products) into the USB port. This is too bad because in other areas the Kindle Fire HD absolutely kicks butt on screen quality and on-board sound. :&lt;C) This leaves [pure] Android. After ferreting through a handful of Android tablets the Nexus 7 emerged at the top of the "value" heap. Lots of features for the money! Just an awesome device for only $200-250.But the Nexus 7 doesn't look like its ready for prime time. Way way too many postings on quality control issues. And the postings don't appear to be tapering off as we get further from the initial release date. As of this November 2012 posting current reviews are still complaining about QC issues with the display glass.Given reports from users who have had to wrestle with ASUS customer service for weeks or months to get a working unit or a refund, it appears that the only prudent way to purchase a Nexus 7 today is to buy one from a brick and motor retailer, open it in the store, check carefully for signs of raised glass, noises when pressing on the glass, and dead pixels. Then take the unit home, charge and discharge several times over a few days to be sure it will take and hold a charge, use the UI heavily and watch for any signs of the glass moving after the screen warms up, or preemptively taking it apart and checking that the display screws are tightened. And do all this within the return period set by the retailer.If I really really wanted a Nexus 7 that bad I might jump through those hoops. But given the lack of an HDMI connector, crappy front facing camera, the absence of a rear facing camera (can you scan those bar codes at Target?), and mediocre on-board speakers, I am tempted to just hold out a while longer and see what the market brings forth over the next few months. And the horror stories regarding ASUS support is the final nail in the coffin.Btw - props to user "DLC" for his many posts offering helpful workarounds for other seemingly missing Nexus 7 features that are in fact not an issue if you know the work around (flash, GPS navigation with no WiFi signal, possible HDMI workaround, etc)UPDATE DEC 20th (the day before the world ends)I ended up buying a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7". It's not perfect, but Walmart has them online occasionally for $149 refurbished. Price was too good pass up. Even if it goes in the garbage can next year it's still worth it. ;>

tablet|Size is perfect. Was debating this or a larger tab but this is ideal. Display is super-sharp and easy on the eyes. Rubber grippy surface on the back is nice. Micro usb works well with flash drive if you have the right app. Battery seems to last. Had about a week, right now we're lovin' it.
---
tablet|Its compact, user friendly and efficient. More than that, it offers a world of apps through the Google store. Whatever your interest you will be sure to find an app for it. Other popular tablet that I have tried restricted me in someway because I do not live in the US. I recommend this especially for people in countries outside of the USA and Canada. I wish however that it had dual cameras and the ability to connect to my TV.
---
tablet|The software is great, games run fast and the CPU is powerful, and the screen looks good enough. My main problem with it is the flash memory is failing after just a few months or something. It takes forever to load things, like I timed it loading IM+ after it's been unloaded from RAM and it takes 73 seconds to start. I see the application is not responding messages all the time, for more than half the apps when they first start up. I've formated it 4 times, I tried flushing the flash memory with an app, as well as tuning kernel settings. Nothing makes the thing any faster. Another problem I had was with the screen lifting on the side like a lot of people had, I fixed it however by putting little pieces of index cards between the screws inside to work as washers and that problem is completely gone.

tablet|I bought this tablet 3 months ago. I loved the google nexus tablet until I was travelling with it on a road trip earlier this month and it ran out of battery. When I got to a place where I could charge it up again, it wouldn't take a charge or even turn on. I have tried to follow directions to fix this problem but so far nothing is working. I am hopeful that I will get this issue resolved but it has been frustrating. Apparently, it is a bug that happens when the batter drains all the way down. I didn't learn about this bug util it happened to me, so I am writing about it in this review to make sure prospective buyers of this product are aware. I really did think it was great little tablet until this happened. Now I think I should have saved my money up and just bought a ipad mini. My husband has an ipad and it has had not issues ever.

tablet|So, I got this tablet for Christmas last year. It worked great! It was so easy to work with and I was super happy with it. I even thought at the time that it was better than an iPad. Then, around the end of February and beginning of March, it would randmly turn off. It would be fully charged and then just turn off and say it was empty. I would plug it in and it would work then but, if I was in the car or on a plane, I want it to work the entire time. Now, the biggest thing I ever dealt with, was when it started flashing different colors and pixels running across the screen. It then turned off and wouldn't turn on for three days, no matter what I did. I plugged in, hit every button, had different people try, nothing turned it on. I finally found a website that told me to hold the button for 30 seconds and it would turn on. It turned on after 14 seconds. It was great but I was shocked, I thought I would have to return it. It is a great product, though, and I think it is just as good, maybe better, than an iPad. I would reccomend it to all my friends.

tablet|Simply put the Nexus still is the best tablet for the money..I'm writing this nearly a year after my initial purchase and I love it just as much as when I first got it.. The automatic updates keeps it working as good as day1The online services like Google drive etc...keeps all my data backed upNetflix and Vudu allows me to stream all the media content I want without the need to save it in my deviceAnd compact size and durability lets you take it everywhere you want without fear.. I dropped it many times (not on cement) around the house and it looks and works great! Most ppl I know have cracked the glass on there smartphone or tablet by now...which again leads me to believe in the design structure of this devise that critics have called cheap looking The backing is plastic but it also is easy to grip...and more important will take a beating and show no wear and tear...All in all if I ever need a new tablet for(which won't be soon) everyday use I would again and again get the Nexus7
---
tablet|At first I thought I was going to exchange it for a 10inch. But, once I saw all the wonderful apps to download, the convience of taking it to the grocery store, and how compact it is I decided to keep it. And now, I'm glad i did.

tablet|As the title states, I am an avid IOS (Iphones and Ipod touches)user, so when the idea of me getting a tablet it was a decision between this and the Ipad Mini.First a few things that turned me off of the Ipad Mini. The 16GB version of the Nexus was $200 (don't buy from Amazon) versus the Ipad Mini charging $330 for what seemed like (from a technical standpoint) a less inferior product, between the missing retina display, the dual core processor and only 512MB Ram (seriously, why does apple cheap out on this spec, it is much needed with today's apps being so demanding on RAM). For $330 I did not want something that was already basically out of date with the specs of the Ipad 2.Which brings me to the Nexus 7I was really worried about learning a new OS, especially knowing IOS (jailbroken) inside and out however, too my surprise I learned it very fast and actually REALLY like it! There are many features that I wonder why they are not in IOS and the speed of this device is phenomenal. So far I am seeing far less "hicups" and force closes as I do on my Iphone 4s.The few cons that i see with this device (not even cons that are worth lowering the score, but thought I would mention)-The light sensor seems to flicker from bright to dim in some lighting situations (not a big deal to me, could just be the weird lighting in my house.-Auto rotation seems very touchy at times (my Iphone has this same problem, half the time I have it off)-Power button would be better on top, like most other devices (this is probably just a personal preference coming from IOS devices)-Built in speaker sounds very flatWith all that said this really is a 5 star product in my mind and the best values out there in 7" tablets, I highly recommend this!

tablet|I have the latest model of the Nexus. It has many good characteristics but the problems outweigh them. From the very beginning the device simply blacked out, forcing me to switch it off and on repeatedly. When it goes to the sleep mode it has to be rebooted because it refuses to automatically unlock. These have been chronic difficulties. When I took it to Staples the service desk person told me that 20% of the units sold in the store had the exact same problems. This strikes me as inexcusable; in other words, 20% of the new "improved' devices are defective. The company's telephone service is absolutely substandard. I had some useless fellow who wasted over twenty minutes of my time with inarticulately expressed remedies that in fact made the unit's performance worse. It is outrageous to pay roughly $250 for something that clearly has severe defects and then be expected to go through the rigamarole of numerous telephone conversations with a useless service department and ultimately fail to solve the problem.If you buy one of these get a service plan and then make absolutely certain that it works properly. Better yet, buy a Samsung instead and save yourself a great deal of aggravation.
---
tablet|I pre-ordered this and had high hopes. Unfortunately, I had the same problem others experienced; the left side of the screen was not adhered to the backing and would lift off when used. Obviously a pretty major defect. Google's customer service was atrocious, definitely the worst I have ever encountered. After an hour+ on hold, they were incapable of comprehending that I wanted a refund, not a replacement (I wasn't interested in a replacement from a company that did not bother with quality control). When I finally got through to someone, I received a form email reassuring me that a "specialist" was working on my case. It took another two weeks just to receive a return label, and then another few weeks for a refund. I assume I'm lucky to have gotten that at all, given the incompetency.I would caution buyers to examine their tablets carefully. The defect was not immediately evident, I only noticed when it made a slight cracking/clicking sound when pressed, caused by the screen moving in and out. With use, more separation occurred.Other than that, I would say it was a pretty average product. The display was fine, the interface workable but not a joy to use. The appeal was really the relatively low price, which I see was explained by not paying for adequate testing prior to release.

tablet|I ordered the Nexus 7 and a Poetic case. Inside of one week of using the device, the screen cracked. It was in its case the entire time. I did not drop, bang, scratch, sit on, or inflict any kind of damage to the Nexus. The screen was simply fine one minute and had a hairline crack the next along with a malfunctioning touch panel. This happened within 10 days of owning the device. First I called Google, through which I purchased the device. They could not help me and told me to call Asus. Asus had me send the device to their headquarters, whereby they told me that they couldn't do anything for me and wanted $150 to fix the screen. I am not hard on my electronics. I have a 2nd generation iPod that is near-perfect, and an iPad and HTC Evo that I have owned for 2 years, neither of them with any damage. While the device performed extremely well for the week that I used it, I am extremely disappointed with the overall construction of the Nexus 7 and will not purchase another Asus or Google product in the future.
---
tablet|Let me start by saying I've had the 2nd generation iPad. I have also have been the owner of 2 android phones. After researching dozens of options, in my opinion, this is just an amazing tablet. I love the form factor above all. I have held the iPad mini, and I think it is a great tablet, however, you can't comftorably hold it in one hand. With the nexus seven, it just feels right..IOS is very simple and fluid, and android has a reputation for being laggy. With the release of the nexus 7, they have clearly fixed this issue.Android just renders everything so beautifully.You can read reviews until your eyeballs fall out, but if you want something that's at a reasonable price and just a steller piece of technology, than buy this.Everything is smooth, and the transitions from one app to another is flawless.

tablet|Greetings all. I originally purchased my Nexus 7 in September of last year, and was quite happy with it, up until the screen randomly cracked. Yes, it just cracked. It was not abused. It did not fall, have an drink placed on it, nor was it stepped on or any other action that might have stressed it. It was sitting on the end of my desk recharging and then "pop". I checked to see if it was hot, and I nothing I felt was more than room temperature.I do not normally write reviews unless I have something positive to say or I am WOW'ed by the product. But in this case, I want others to take note that this is a potential issues. And one that is not covered by the warranty.I have read other forums and articles and apparently this is an issue with this device. So, take it for what it is worth...It is not. Get a Samsung or something else, just not a Nexus 7.Oh, and ASUS said it would cost $206 to replace the screen of a product that cost me $239. I think I will spend my money elsewhere.
---
tablet|ALMOST a good tablet. Google has known for 6+ months. Due to this bug, you can't charge the device unless its powered off, and battery life is abysmal when on... (and this is running the latest greatest OS from GOOG - no solution available.) [...]You can solve it by removing all music and videos.
---
tablet|Since purchasing had to send it back to ASUS for warranty once. Don't bother contacting Google for any support either. It since then is about to go into service again. The first time the screen went crazy and stayed that way. This time the Gyro has completely failed.
---
tablet|I started off loving the tablet and I forgave it for crashing a few apps a couple times. dropped it once with a case on and it wouldn't turn on. good luck trying to get a replacement. Asus were totally rude and I was on hold forever. I am now happily typing this from my new kindle fire hd.

tablet|If you are looking for a review that simply repeats the description, read the description.Our 16gb Nexus 7 was a gift, and what a gift it is. Onward to the rundown...NegativesNo internal memory expansionDoes not ship with flash....that's it.PositivesMemory is expandable with a usb otg, which is dirt cheap (think pack of juicy fruit).Flash is supported in other browsers which can be downloaded free.16gb is really more than enough when you think about it. This is not a dedicated music player, not a laptop, and not a camera. It's a tablet, thankfully not one made by Apple. Since my first iPod (coincidentally Apple's first, too) I have been extremely disappointed with Apple products. Aesthetics are not representative of capability. It amazes me that the Nexus 7 draws comparisons to tablets costing several hundred dollars more and outshines them in every regard. Seeing all of the Apple fanboy comments here makes me chuckle, but the sad truth is that this tablet should be five stars across the board. I wonder when society willl embrace function over form. You can root your Android device without paying someone else, and you can do anything the OS is capable of. Even without rooting, ICS is outstanding.Last thing I want to address is the ridiculous complaints I have read in some of these reviews about the lack of a rear- facing camera. Seriously? If I want to take pictures with something bigger than my phone, do you know what I use? A CAMERA. No cell phone or tablet has the capabilities to rival my camera, and they never will. You can't beat quality optics, especially with the tiny image sensor inherent on compact devices.On the whole, coupled to a cheap bluetooth keyboard, this tablet is ideal for a range of processes when a laptop is too bulky or boring. The OS is nice, power is awesome, and build quality is fantastic.

tablet|I'm reluctantly giving the Google Nexus 7 one star. I have owned this tablet since September, and I have had escalating issues with charging the tablet. First, the charging cable would not sit securely when it connected to the micro-usb port. It would fall out frequently and I would have to position the tablet at an angle with objects supporting the cord to keep it charging. An annoyance, but not a deal breaker. I thought it might be due to the tapering of the edges (which I like) and the fact that unlike my other micro-usb devices the port is upside down (the wide part of the charging cable's metal connector goes in at the top instead of the bottom). The tapering edges provide less surface for the charger to "brace" itself against the device and the upside down port means that others (my family members), by habit, would initially try and insert the cable connector in the wrong way. There was no evidence of damage in the first two weeks before they learned to adapt, but this could accelerate normal wear and tear for those not paying attention -- again, an annoyance but not a big deal.Then, as I was plugging the charging cable into the device my son bumped my arm, and just this small action caused the metal housing surrounding the inside of the m-usb port to bend (I caught the charger on the outside lip of the port). The inside of the charging port has a metal sheet that is split at the bottom (you can see the issue here [...] -- it is suppose to lay flat and be seamless, but it is very easily bent. Charging became somewhat trickier but it still wasn't a huge issue.But then the contact pins on the interior of the m-usb started to crumble! I was having issues at the beginning of December where it would just not charge, and when I inspected the port again, I noticed some of the pins were longer than the others. I have to use my tablet almost every day for school, and although it holds a charge for a fairly long time (at first it was 12 hours, then more like 8, then sometimes more like 4)it still needs to be charged at least once a day. The tablet began to only charge erratically, and now it does not charge at all. After less than six months of normal daily usage.I did not buy this tablet through Amazon but rather through Google, and the return/exchange process seems grim. I've worked in IT so I am aware that electronic devices can be delicate, but other tablets are much more robust than this. I loved my N7 (especially for the price) while it was working, but I just can't recommend it given the charging issues.

tablet|Finally, the sweet spot in a tablet. I have an ipad2, and an amazon kindle fire in addition to this tablet. This one beats them both easily. Probably the biggest single reason is the interference the other two companies (apple and amazon) build into their tablets. I don't like the proprietary nature of either. Apple forces you into their world (it IS a good world, just limited and confining to my tastes), and to be fair the ipad2 is too big. I don't like holding it in bed while reading. The ipad mini might solve this, but it can't solve the apple walled garden. Amazon is even worse with their fire. The android os is hardly recognizable in the fire, like apple, amazon tells you what you can play with and what you cannot.That brings me to the nexus. It is solidly built and is the perfect size. It is FAST; it zips. It is also pure android, and android upgrades are quickly ported onto your system. I really like this machine. It just lets me do whatever I want to and it does it in a great form factor that simply works very well.
---
tablet|I love this device. At first I wasn't sure that the Android tablet was much more than a large version of my Android phone. So I delayed purchase and continued looking at reviews. Then my brother purchased one and I demoed his. I was so impressed with the response speed, the beautiful HD screen, the apps available, video chat options, and and the size and weight that I decided to buy. In addition, the reviews I read placed the Nexus 7 as the best tablet in its price range. The one limitation being the lack of an expansion card slot. This didn't bother me since both Google Play and Amazon allow you to store media content in the cloud. Highly recommended!

tablet|After deciding my Samsung Galaxy Tab was making me nuts (froyo. seriously.), I was on a mission to replace it with the best that I could comfortably afford. I tried to get an iPad 3, I really did. But I couldn't justify the expense, so I was looking at another 7 inch Android tablet. I considered the Galaxy Tab 2, the Kindle fire HD, but I live and work in the "Google-verse" so that didn't make sense.Finally, out comes the Google Nexus 7. Still wasn't sold, but the specs were incredible, the reviews from the pros were all positive, and when put up head to head against the kindle fire HD, it came out ahead. It just had everything I wanted and needed, so I took a shot and bought it.It's been nothing but good ever since. I knew what I was getting myself into, so I KNOW to be careful of it and not drop it. I knew it didn't have and SD card slot so I bought the 2 dollar OEM. This thing is smoking! It's faster than my other tablet, as fast as my iPad. No lags in video streaming. Pages are buttery-smooth, and gaming on this thing is a dream. I used to only game on the iPad, because the Tablet was just too slow and awkward, but this thing is amazing for gaming, and when I (Fianally!) figured out how to get the amazon app store on it, I was golden. I can even do my schoolwork on it.The keyboard is really impressively accurate and predictive, and if you're used to swype-ing the keyboard? Download (for free) slideIT. Trust me. You'll love it.I went in search of a better, faster replacement for my aging galaxy tab, and got way more than I bargained for.The only cons I can think of? I really wish it came with an SD card slot, but the extension gets around that.I don't know about anybody else, but my experience thus far with the nexus 7 has been nothing but positive.Highly recommend it.

tablet|This is a good product. I am a college student and i use it all the time with no problem. The tablet is super fast even with a live wallpaper on it , there is no lag like usual tablets, also the GPS in it works great. I really like this product and would definitely recommend it to people over the kindle fire and other similar products. I have heard many people complain about some screen problems with the nexus seven, but i had a kindle fire that kept shutting off on me constantly and crashing just a day after purchase, which was what led me to the purchase of my nexus 7. No Regrets.

tablet|Unless you have suffered with another android tablet you just cannot know how good this one is.Before you think it does not work good be sure you have the Jellybean update on it. It is just not going to be that good at all without Jellybean. In settings->About tablet it lists Android version and if it is less then 4.1.1 then you are not on the good version yet. Try System updates. It may say you are up to date on the first try, mine did but then a couple hours later the update was there in the notifications. Do not think it has it because you just got it. I just got mine straight from Google and it needed the update.I have both the Nexus 7 and the Galaxy Nexus and love them both so far.One more nice thing about it is you can Bluetooth tether the Nexus 7 to the Galaxy Nexus. Of course you could always do that with WiFi but the Bluetooth version seems easier.

tablet|I originally purchased the original kindle fire about a year ago. I loved it I really did. At the time it was the best cheap tablet on the market bar none.Now the nexus 7 exists and I must say it truly does out match the kindle fire (ORIGINAL KINDLE FIRE 1ST GENERATION). It is faster, has a better screen, and I like google apps like gmail and google drive. The new android jellybean operating system is amazingly smooth and beautiful and I really have not enjoyed a tablet this much. The feel is a solid step up from the original kindle fire as the corners are more rounded and the rubberized back feels great and adds grip. It is also physically smaller than the kindle fire but has the same size screen. Between the two there is no comparison and I am glad I upgraded from the original kindle fire to the nexus 7, well worth the money.Comparing the ipad mini to the nexus 7 is similar. Again the ipad mini is slower, screen isn't as good and the ipad mini cost a lot more. The ipad mini does have a bigger screen but to me the ipad mini doesn't do enough to differentiate itself from a middle man between the ipod touch and the ipad. It exists but does it have to? I'm not sure. It is a good looking product though. To be fair I do not own an Ipad mini my brother does. And if you are invested into ios then the ipad mini is for you versus other small tablets.In all the nexus 7 is amazing. Even compared to the kindle hd the nexus 7 takes it. Its openness via true google makes it more desirable to me than a kindle fire hd and I love jelly bean!This is still the best small tablet on the market, in my opinion anyway.

tablet|For our 20th. Anniversary my wife surprised me with a Nexus 7 tablet as a gift. I am a big gadget geek, and even though I already have an iPad (3rd. Gen), I've been wanting an Android device to play with. I was a little worried about having a ASUS product, as a friend of mine was royalty screwed over by them on a Netbook he bought a few years back (sent in for warrantee service 6 times, and never fixed), but I figured that everyone deserves a second chance. After setting up the tablet, and working with it for a few hours, I fell in love.First thing I noticed, even before pressing the power button, is the over all build quality of this tablet. Although the case is plastic, it is very solid. The screen is very strong Corning Glass (not sure if it is Gorilla Glass or not) but as with my iPad it is flawless. After powering it up I found that the quad-core Tegra 3 processor is fast, and the 1280 x 800 screen is very crisp. The display is not up the quality of the Retina display on my iPad, but I have no complaints about its quality, after reading for over 2 hours my eyes didn't feel tired or strained in any way. Android 4.1.1 (Jelly Bean) seems very responsive and quite functional. I had little problem in figuring out how to set-up, navigate and alter settings. The GooglePlay store seems to have a lot of apps available. I was very happy to find that HanDBase was available for Android. I use this database (lite) app on all my iOS devices and it is compatible all my files, which is quite helpful.I would have liked more memory as an option as I know that many Android devices can use SD cards as expansion, a feature that is not available on the Nexus 7 (which isn't that big of a deal, as I am used to it from iOS) and I don't plan on carrying around a lot of music or video (I have a Touch and iPad for that), but there is the option to stream your movies and music from Google. It seems to work quite well as I watched the free Transformers movie, and it played without a hitch.I have seen some complaints that a cellular version of the tablet isn't available, but since I use only Wi-Fi on all my devices, I really can't add anything to that. I do hope a future model adds it for people who need it, as the Nexus 7 is a really great option. Also speaking of Wi-Fi I was quite surprised by the range of the Nexus. My iPad can see 4 wireless routers from my bedroom, but the Nexus detected 11. That's more than my Toshiba laptop can find!There isn't a rear facing camera, which I do miss from my Touch/iPad. Not that I use either as a camera (I have a Canon I use for that), but I do use them a lot as a barcode reader. The front camera is 1.2 megapixels, and the quality of it puts the one on my Apple devices to shame (I'm only talking about the front camera, the back camera on the iPad is far superior to this one).I thought the smaller size would be a disadvantage when switching between the Nexus 7 and iPad, but it really is a fair trade off, even though the screen is smaller, it is so much lighter and easier to hold (even one handed, that I wouldn't think of doing with my iPad).I believe that the Nexus 7 will become my take everywhere device. It's compact, light and it doesn't worry me as much to carry the less expansive equipment with me. It has twice the memory of my Touch (although I'm planning to upgrade to a 5th. Gen Touch since I found out it added a flash to the camera, and I want to try iOS 6 without upgrading my iPad with a possibly buggy upgrade). After working with the iPad, my Touch seems way too slow!Also Google gave a lot of extras including a handful of songs, magazines and even a movie (Transformers: Dark Of The Moon) plus $25 for use in their app store. All this for a tablet that cost only $250. I paid $700 for my iPad, and didn't receive anything at all extra.I haven't tried the NFC yet, as no stores in my area use it for POS, but I hope to soon. I don't see it replacing my debit card anytime soon, but I would still like to see how it works.The Nexus 7 is what I like to think of as my laptop tablet, where the iPad is my desktop tablet.I would easily recommend the Nexus 7 to anyone looking for a tablet.

tablet|I use my N7 every day. I read comics on it. I stream video from my PC on it. I check my email. I surf the web. The thing was pretty cheap compared to a ipad.I only have two problems with this device. The volume doesn't go very high, so you will need headphones. I'm not sure if they changed this yet but when I bought this I was unable to connect to wifi without turning off my security. I was unable to setup secure connection until i got wifi working. These makes no sense since you can use the N7 without wifi. My only other option was to go to someplace with free wifi so I could setup my wifi settings. This kind of mistake should never happen in 2012.

tablet|I bought two of these for my boys for Christmas. I love the quality of the images, etc. Very clear. The size is perfect for their little hands. The only problem I have with this is the lack of automatic restriction options. I got spoiled by the easy, basic restrictions that are offered on the iPod. I was able to install a password to restrict downloading anything, restrict things like youtube, etc. And I could turn these things on and off very quickly and easily. This doesn't have anything like that and I haven't yet found an app that I'm completely happy with. The constant barrage of messages they get to download new apps and the fact that they can do this at the tap of a button is very annoying.

tablet|This is a great little device. I bought it for my wife and she is in love with it. It came down to a toss up between this and the Kindle Fire HD, and the combination of price and features - especially the full access to Android - was the clincher. The display is great and the battery life is very good. The form factor is perfect for medium to larger hands, but my wife's smaller hands find difficulty in stretching in portrait mode and then it is too small for two hands in landscape. For some reason the antenna is not as strong as I expected based on the bars received on this device versus other tablets and phones in the house - not sure this is a device flaw.Great device if this is the form factor for which you are searching

tablet|I have a regular Kindle, a Kindle fire, a Kindle HD and now this Nexus. I like it very much but I was so used to the ease of Kindles that for me it was a little hard to get used to-- I kept wanting it to be just exactly like the Kindles which it is not. It has google play store on it and that is the main reason I got it for the kids to be able to use, we put three of us in the household on it as users and so we each have our apps, etc. I think it charges fast and the sound is good however I like Kindle sound better especially on my kindle hd. I do find myself picking up my kindles more often but that is just because I think I am unfamiliar with tablets in general- I don't own a smartphone and so having so many things this Nexus can do just throws me off a bit and I tend to want to use it simply for reading- I downloaded the kindle app to read with it even though you can read from it on the books tab itself. My daughter is showing me more and more things this can do and I love it more every day :)

tablet|This is my first tablet and was given to me by my wife. What a thoughtful gift! Right out of the box, it worked great, and then the next time I used it, it was even better (I was already getting used to it). And then, next time I went to turn it on, nothing. NOTHING!! I found, in a Forum on Androids, that this is not an uncommon problem with the Nexus 7, and that it can be started by pushing down the power and both volume buttons at the same time. Bingo! But now, almost every time I go to turn it on, I have to use this procedure, and quite frankly, it's a pain in neck. I'm trying to return it to the seller as a defective unit, and honestly, it's made me a bit gun shy of the Nexus 7, which would be a drag, as it gets fantastic reviews, and I think it's a great little unit, when it turns on (minor detail). I will update when I know more. But for now, I'd say it has a very zippy response, a very clear screen, a decent battery life, a great build (with the exception of the power button) but a rather terrible speaker.A follow up, as promised. After speaking with Asus about my issue, and following their instructions to completely reset the tablet, I am now experiencing a perfect experience with it. It seems something just went funky the first time I set it up. Now it's a great unit... turns on right when I push the power button. Every time. Great little tablet. My only complaint, as previously mentioned, is the sound quality. Tinny angry only so so... I think they could have done better. Otherwise, I love everything about it. Way to go, Asus and Google.

tablet|This is my 4th Android tablet and I am far happier with this tablet than others in the past. I have plenty of experience with tablets and I think the flaws of this tablet are very minimal in comparison to what it does well.Pros:+ quad core - super fast+ amazing screen+ super fast GPS lock on, even when not on WiFi (6 seconds!)+ great battery life+ Amazingly light weight+ USB hosting+ Gets frequent updates+ feels very solidCons:- no micro SD. Get the 32GB- no HDMI output- no rear camera- not guerrilla glass: prone to cracking if droppedIt has NFC, which has amazing potential, but I haven't had the opportunity to use it yet. There are NFC stickers that you can get to do similar to things that the app Tasker does and that looks really cool. The device is very solid and it is the 'coolest' Android tablet on the market at the moment, that is what sways you. My last tablet had a rear camera and I thought I was going to miss it, but so far it hasn't been an issue. If you are looking for a great tablet, this cannot be beat at the moment. If you are an iOS fan and thinking about making the switch, this is a great tablet to get started with. The quality and speed meets the standards iOS users are used to and it provides a great user experience.

tablet|I have owned two Iphones now and nearly all of my experience with smartphones/tablets has been with Apple products. I received my nexus 7 as a christmas present and I am very happy/impressed. I purchased my wife a kindle fire hd for christmas and if you are looking for an affordable tablet that isn't especially bulky, you can't go wrong either way. It is small enough to fit in my inside coat pocket on the way to work, yet the screen is big enough and clear enough that games, videos, photos and books are much more accessible than on a smartphone. If you have a decent smartphone you likely won't want to carry this around with you, but you certainly can without a bag or something to carry it around in like you would a larger tablet. Even if you leave it at home, it is powerful and convenient enough that I likely won't be digging out my old laptop as frequently as I used to. I love it!If you are curious about the android platform but don't want to commit to 2 years with a phone you aren't sure that you'll like, I definitely recommend you give this a try. I don't think I have convinced my wife yet, but I think I will be kicking apple to the curb when my phone plan is eligible for an upgrade in March.

tablet|Worked great for a few weeks as an e-reader. Completely stopped working and didn't turn on after being turned off the first time.

tablet|LOVE this thing more every day! I have had this now for a couple weeks. I play games, check email, Facebook, instagram, surf the web, watch videos, and listen to music, and make calls on this using the Groove IP App. At first I was bummed because I could not download my itunes. But not to fear! With Google Music Manager I was able to sync it with my itunes music so that I can listen to it on my Nexus. I was also able to get the Kindle Apps (kinda tricky but possible) on this tablet along with the Google play store Apps. So I have the best of both worlds :) LOVE this and cannot recommend it enough. One of my best purchases.

tablet|My wife and I love ours. Fast and trouble free. Very stable WIFI aquisition. Really no complaints. Nice screen, very sensitive to touch or with stylus use.

tablet|My wife has an iPad 2nd gen. After picking one of these up for me, tweaking it the way I wanted, and getting a nice case, I never touch the iPad. I love my Nexus. Seven inches is a great size (It's also a size that Steve Jobs called "stupid" ... go figure, now they're working on an iPad mini. Uh huh). I'm an IT guy, so I rooted it so I could stickmount a USB drive .. can't do that with an iPad. It's proven invaluable on the job, when a client's computer is down & I need to download a patch or malware tool from the Net. No need to carry a laptop anymore ... awesome. Plus if you root it, Google Play will credit your account with $25 even if you didn't buy it direct from them .. that was a nice surprise!Battery life could be better (I get about 8-9 hours of hard use, connected to WiFi networks all day). No biggie .. I'm used to plugging my in cellphone every night anyway. I just do the same with the Nexus. And speaking of charging .. how great is it that Google / Asus went with Micro USB? Meanwhile Apple's switching up proprietary connectors again (and nickel and diming the lemmings again). Sigh.I have had no problems with the screen popping out of the bezel (though the fix is very easy to do). No problems with screen flickering. I find the saturation and contrast to be just fine (it's a 7" tablet, not a 24" HD flat panel). Only problem I had is I ran the battery down to 4%, at which time the tablet automatically turned off (to not take the battery all the way to zero). Plugged it into the micro USB cable I use for my cell .. there was a buzzing from the tablet for a few seconds .. and then it stopped. I went to bed. Seven hours later, the battery was only at 21%. Yikes. Thought I had a bad battery.There's some talk that the charger that comes with the tablet has a higher amperage (2A) than what you get with a lot of other micro USB chargers (many of which seem to be 1.5A), and that this makes a big difference in charging if you run the battery all the way down. Could be, but I didn't really see much difference in charging speed. It just seems like that first 15-20% takes a long time if the battery's been run below 5%. But there's also some question as to whether or not there might be firmware glitch here, because some reported that upon running their battery all the way down, they couldn't get the tablet to charge at all .. and they could't turn it back on. Someone discovered that if you hold the power button in for longer than 30 seconds, the tablet will boot back up & charging resumes as normal. Hmmm. At any rate, if you run your battery down all the way, give this a try before you send your tablet back! And hopefully Google & Asus are working on a solution.

tablet|The nexus 7 looks and performs beautifully and is reasonably priced. But one small drop (3ft) onto a CARPETED FLOOR and the glass shattered. It is now a brick. Thank goodness my Credit card has accidental destruction coverage, but I won't be using the insurance money to buy another one. My Samsung galaxy has suffered dozens of much worse droppages over the past 18 months and not even a scratch. This device given as a Christmas gift just barely made it to new years. Unless you plan on never holding it in your hand or carrying it, I would stay away.
---
tablet|I have had my Nexus 7 for a few months now and while I like the battery life, great screen, compact size and ease of use, sometimes the screen is annoyingly unresponsive or very sluggish to respond. I initially bought it as a solid e-reader w/the ability for some apps. However, it quickly found its way to being my main source of online social interaction (Facebook, Flipboard, Current, etc, etc).If you're looking for a reader/social media tool right now it's worth the purchase price. But if this isn't very high on your priority list I'd wait for their next version to come out.
---
tablet|My & my friend bought one device each. Both of us have a problem with device in landscape mode & while playing any video the screen goes dim until it's fully black. The other issue is flickering in landscape mode. I contacted the seller & they offered full refund. However, resending the item would cost a lot, which might not be beneficial.
---
tablet|I was impressed by both the hardware specs of this tablet and by the ease of connectivity through Google. I have a Samsung Galaxy S 4G phone so I liked that all of my apps would sync onto both devices, as well as streamlining my e-mail and other settings. Win Win. Or so I thought.Here are a couple of the major issues:DOES NOT SUPPORT FLASH-----Update: it does not support Flash, but you can do a couple of go arounds. They are a bit of a pain. I installed the Boat browser with an archived flash, and it works well. But you cannot watch Amazon Prime in landscape view, just in portrait view. But you can pop out the video so it fits the entire screen left to right, just while the device is in portrait. I am still looking at various archived Flash versions as well as various other browsers. Firefox to the rescue please! (Still having trouble with street view unless you open Google maps in the other browsers). Google, just give us a Flash app download please that works in your Android 4.1 Chrome browser!------------------So what does this mean? Well currently I cannot watch my Amazon Prime videos on this tablet. Instead, Google wants to charge me a monthly fee for Hulu Plus, or Netflix has an app for download. But the question remains: why should I pay for these services when Amazon offers a similar service for free?And with the non support of Flash come two very interesting problems: you cannot view the street view mode in Google maps (huh???) and many Youtube videos are not supported. What gives Google? Two Google programs that cannot run fully due to lack of supporting Flash? I for one find this ludicrous. If Google Maps and Youtube don't run fully without Flash, then why isn't Flash supported on the tablet?Now, for those techies that want to actually play Amazon Videos there is a way, though it doesn't work THAT well. I actually installed Firefox by going to their website. From Firefox you can look for an archived version of Flash for Android. It will be a version compatible with an older Android version, but it WILL work. Just not very well and not very clearly. You will have to open Firefox and go directly to the Amazon website then go to Instant Movies and search for your favorite. I am watching Star Trek TNG and it comes in decently, though some issues with sound and fuzzy appearance at times. But it's better than nothing until Amazon releases an app (which I hope they will). I also hope that Google will fix their street view system as well.I will be experimenting with various other archived versions of Flash and Firefox until I find a good match, then I will post in comments. If you are just playing with Firefox and Flash, then you are not risking anything to your tablet. Just only use the Flash downloads FROM Adobe's website.But enough of my rant about the lack of Flash support. Other than that glaring problem there is one more issue, which I am glad to address: unscrupulous sales of this tablet. Even Google tried to charge me sales tax (I live in Oregon - no sales tax) and shipping. Making the total for an 8GB over $250. So here is the answer:BUY FROM STAPLES.COM :Sorry to recommend someone other than Amazon, but since you can't buy directly from Amazon, you have to pay a larger markup for purchase from a 3rd party seller. Staples did not charge sales tax, and shipping was free. It took two days to arrive. I cannot express how happy I was with that purchase. They only had the 16GB, but it still cost less in the end than the 8GB directly from Google. And I still got my $25 Google Play credit.The other factor to point out is Wi-Fi only. But at $250, I really can't complain. If you really need a 3G/4G tablet, they do have those and you will spend a pretty penny.Also, no SD slot, but since Google is trying to encourage folks to load content into their 'drive' (their version of a virtual cloud) it seems that 16GB is enough to load many books and apps. You won't be loading much media onto the device if you're using Hulu Plus, Google Play, or Netflix. If you have music, I recommend loading it into the Amazon MP3 Cloud, which there is an app for that is compatible with this device.There is a micro USB port, so my Samsung chargers all work with this tablet as well. You can also connect the tablet to a PC with a micro to standard USB. I would also suspect that you might be able to use SD memory somehow if you have an SD reader plugged into a USB to micro USB cable. I am not sure how to make the tablet 'see' the SD card in this instance, but I am sure there would be a software download that would work. I haven't tried it because I use Amazon Cloud for most of my music.The tablet is actually pretty amazing despite the many flaws listed above. If you are using it as intended: an E-reader (compatible with Amazon Kindle App), a browser (Chrome really is the best browser for speed/functionality), and a media device (if you are using Netflix, Hulu Plus, Youtube (for most videos), and Google Play). I have also installed NES and SNES apps and downloaded a few ROMS and play classic games. There are also many games and various apps for a variety of uses. You can also load a Google map into the tablet to view offline if need be. Sadly, I would just use my 4G phone with Google maps in that instance.So why buy this tablet? Well I would say that perhaps I should have bought an Amazon Kindle Fire. I miss my Amazon streaming video. But the ability to sync my phone and use the same apps is a huge plus. Having Chrome as the default browser is also huge. Access to the variety of Android ready apps is really one of the best aspects of this tablet. It does have an HD screen, though slightly less color than the iPad (at $250 less though). The screen is also half the size of the iPad. But that's not a bad thing.This is a very portable tablet, unlike the larger, nearly laptop size iPad. I have a laptop already, so why would I buy a tablet that is less amazing than my laptop when it's about the same size and nearly as weighty? Granted, if you are going sans laptop, the iPad is a great device.But for a portable (smaller) tablet with lots of bells and whistles, and impressive hardware, you really have the Google Nexus 7, the Samsung Galaxy Tab, and the Kindle Fire. Each has pros and cons, but for ease of use, hardware, and connectivity I think the Nexus 7 wins. Though the Nexus has its share of flaws, if I had to go back and buy one again, it would probably be the Nexus. The Samsung is impressive, and my Galaxy S phone has been perfect; but with the newer version, it also lacks the Flash compatibility, though it has an SD card slot. The Kindle Fire is an e-reader first and foremost, with decent media use, but not as functional as the Nexus; though it does have Android 4.0. It really depends on what you are looking for in a tablet.I can say I'm happy with the Nexus 7. I think there are a few issues Google should address. Mainly adding Flash would help. An Amazon Instant Video app would help too (hint hint Amazon). Amazon just released one for the iPad, so hopefully it's coming. In my humble opinion, all three mainstream tablets are amazing and competitive devices.+++Pros: Heavy duty screen, great HD display, lightweight, smaller than Kindle HD (less bevel), fast wi-fi, access to thousands of apps via Google Play, access to Amazon MP3 cloud, decent 16GB hard drive, impressive Nvidia graphics, and 10 hour battery.---Cons: Lack of Flash, currently no Amazon Instant Movie app, no 3g/4g model, no SD slot, only front facing camera (no rear).Verdict: you should seriously consider this tablet or the Kindle Fire HD. Both are the best in the $200-$250 range at this time. Or wait for the iPad mini.

tablet|I'll say this straight off: if the unit didn't cease working after the 4th charge and the accelerometer kept working, this tablet would be one of my favorite gadgets. But seeing how both of those issues are present here, it gets a 2.First off: the accelerometer doesn't work. I've seen other threads mentioning this issue as well, so I'm not alone in the experience. Whenever I use Google Sky Map the screen would shake and stutter. Calibrating the accelerometer and compass didn't help. I tried two other Nexus 7's at work and they all had the same thing. Needless to say all of the 7 owners and I were disappointed with the units.About 4 charges on the battery the unit refused to turn on. Holding down the button for 1 minute changed nothing, and charging the battery again also yielded no new results.I'm returning it for my money back as I haven't seen any news that the unit is repaired. Next time I'll wait for the a shiny piece of tech to be out for a while before I buy one and get to test it for Google with my own money.

tablet|I have used multiple Apple products in the past and was somewhat unfamiliar with the Android platform. The transition learning was fairly easy. The hardware and equipment itself have been GREAT! This will fill it's purpose perfectly. I intend to use for the following: e-reader, watch occasional movie with Comcast TV, watch Hulu plus shows, and news and newspaper reading. The operation is very smooth and fast. There is no lag in operation. I really don't have any complaints. Buy with confidence!

tablet|Tecnically Superior to Kindle in every sense. Higher definition, more storage, and quad core processing. Google have not disrespected overseas users the way Amazon did by making the Fire available only within the US but instead made the Nexus 7 immediately available in Europe and Australia. I've purchased my last kindle of any description. Reign on Nexus 7!

tablet|I got the 16GB from Google Play store. It has been a couple of weeks using the device. I like the hardware very much. The tablet is really well made. I feel nexus 7 in my hands much better than my iPad3. However, I keep using my phone, GS3 or iPad3 for web browse, email, skype, facebook, games, Youtube, Netflix, and Splashtop. I do not read magazines or books. I am trying to force myself to use my Nexus 7, but I am not successful changing my habit just yet. Here is why.1. Jelly Bean is nice and smooth, but I experienced some bugs with Apps that were not up to date for OS 4.1. In time, they should be resolved though.2. I like clean OS with less bloatware, but JB needs some basic features like a numerical battery indicator and Landscape mode on the default launcher (because Nexus 7 is a tablet) Sure, I can install Apps to correct all these, but I would like to have them by default.3. No Flash support although it is not the tablet's fault. I can make Flash contents work by side loading the flash player apk, but several browsers often crash watching contents in Flash.4. As we all know, not many Android Apps are optimized for tablets.5. My place is very clouded with 2.4GHz devices, so I have 5GHz Wifi setup. However, Nexus 7 does not support 5GHz. iPad3 and GS3 do support 5GHz.6. The Speaker is weaker than my phone, so no good for Netflix or Skype without a headset.7. Screen is very crisp, but pretty faded due to Nexus 7's aggressive Auto brightness. Sure I can set it to higher value and get nice and bright screen, but I am just too lazy to switch when I change my environment. I would like it to be little brighter from the Auto brightness. It is much darker than other devices set at Auto.8. No Micro SD is OK for me, but I need to store some videos for my daughter. I keep using my GS3 or my old Archos 70 tablet for that.9. HDMI would have been nice. If it had HDMI via MHL, I could have used the tablet as a media player in my bed room mirroring video to a larger screen. I am using GS3 for that now.10. Nexus 7 should have a much better front camera than iPad3, but my Skype recipients told me videos are not good from Nexus 7. It could be the software though since Nexus 7 is not certified by Skype just yet. As a result, I have to use iPad3 or GS3 for Skype.I understand comparing Nexus 7 with iPad and GS3 is like apples and oranges. iPad3 and GS3 should have better hardware from much higher price than Nexus 7, but I still have to somehow find a way to use Nexus 7. The only advantage so far from Nexus 7 is that it is smaller and lighter than iPad and larger screen than my phone. The battery life is not as good as iPad, but it is much better than my GS3. It feels really great in hands. I think Nexus 7's processing speed is on par with iPad3. However, Nexus 7 is slower than my GS3. Maybe that is why I use GS3 more often. If I read magazines or books from tablets, Nexus 7 might become my favorite device. I will keep forcing myself to use it.Conclusion:This is still the best tablet at $200 and $250 as of 8/1/2012, but if you already have other similar devices like myself, you will have hard time finding a reason to use it.

tablet|This sells for $199 now. Check Office Depot, etc. The new 32GB is selling for $249. Amazing how many uninformed shoppers there are.

tablet|Horrible. I tired connecting to my company wifi during setup. But due to the type of security we use, I cannot connect. So I am stuck, I cannot bypass this step in the setup and live chat said I was number 83 in the queue and wait time was about 131 minutes. Then it cut off while I was waiting because it was past 6pm PST. Phone support is bad as well, on hold for 30 minutes as I type this out. There needs to be a way to bypass the wifi setup in the startup process.very disappointed in setup and support.

tablet|You may read some of the other reviews to learn how the Google N7 tablet works. Instead I will focus on the hardware by Asus. Many owners and I are having the same critical problem: the Nexus 7 will not charge. I have read online that this is because of a faulty wiring issue so simply repaired that many owners end up doing it themselves. I will not attempt to do this. Luckily I bought my Nexus 7 directly from Google, so they may support their warranty. If you buy yours from anywhere else, good luck. Besides the fact that I can no longer use my tablet because it won't charge, I also find as a 50-something male that the 7" screen is just too small. I am going to probably end up going out and getting an IPad II. What I should've done in the first place!

tablet|The tablet was buggy and unstable. I have an android phone that I love but this experience was totally frustrating. I want to clarify that the rating is for the product not the sellers

tablet|I bought this as a Tab for daily use in Medical School. Love the available apps and portability. With a leather case I can take it anywhere and everywhere. With an external keyboard I type all my notes into it. The Easy Voice Recorder app is perfect for recording lectures and importantly, does not take up massive amounts of storage.My main complaint is not so much a problem with the Tablet but the way I am using it. I have lots of pdfs of medical books. While the 7-inch format is perfect for reading regular books and there are good apps for reading and highlighting text, the problem is that for Medical Books the screen is way to small. There are good readers where you can view a single column but this is very tedious with medical books and, for studying, I like to be able to see the whole page or graphics and text at the same time, this is not good for that.Other issues: My headphone jack only plays one channel and that not even all the time or with every headset. This is a known issue and yes Google is replacing those units but hard for me to send it back as I use it every day. The built in speaker and volume (for speaker or headphones) are terribly weak.

tablet|Unfortunately, I was hit with the inconvenience of one. I just received my Nexus 7 yesterday, and enjoyed it for the hour that it was working. The apps seemed cool, I started loading some ebooks on there, the free Transformers movie looked fantastic even though the movie itself sucks sack. I was happy... until I downloaded Google Sky and started playing. Not sure if it was coincidence, but after that the unit's stopped accepting any of my touches on the screen. It was just done. I tried a soft restart, hard reset, and nothing seemed to fix it even when done multiple times. I couldn't even get past the lock screen, except for 2 random times when I was pawing at the screen like a frustrated 5 yr old. Somehow, my frantic swipes got through the lock screen and I was able to get to settings to do a wipe to factory defaults. Still, the screen was F'd up. So... RMA time for me.I'm not a diehard Apple fan, or Android fan. All I want is something that works well, looks cool, and lets me customize it out the arse. It sucks when you get so excited for something, and it completely disappoints you. I don't want an iPad, I have an iPhone (and honestly it bores the hell out of me). The most customization you can do with iPhone is change your background. iPhones are nice, but designed so simply that it's borderline outdated at this point. They haven't redesigned the iOS look in how long? Or even changed a ringtone in 5 yrs? Oh well... I digress, as my hopes for the Nexus 7 are over for now. It's sad too, because I can tell it's a fantastic device if it actually worked. I've rarely ever, no matter what brand, had a product be this obviously defective. I refuse to even try to exchange for a new Nexus, I am going to wait on the next generation to see if they are manufactured better.If you really want to give it a shot, be aware of the possibility of a dud. If you get a good one, then luck you... from what I have seen in my hour of use, it's a fantastic device.EDIT: I decided to try ordering another from B&H a week later. Now that I've had a few days, I've raised my rating a little. I do really like the N7, BUT guess what... a few days into using it and I am having a different (also seemingly common) defect. I have screen flicker when reducing the brightness down. It's not terrible, but annoying. If I buy something, it should be perfect out of the box. I also noticed that at the lowest setting, the screen is still pretty bright. To compare, iPhone and iPad backlight goes down super low when wanted, saving lots of battery life and making it easier on the eyes in the dark. I'm not sure why Android refuses to make their backlight control go comparably low (aside from having to get an app to do it). My original Droid phone was the same way with it's overly high lowest brightness setting. Anyway, now I am again stuck in the 'return or exchange' dilemma. I'm not sure I'm willing to take the 'third time's a charm' route.EDIT 12/10/12:I've had my second Nexus 7 (unfortunately bought before Google changed prices/GB versions) and I'm loving it. There are some minor quirks and imperfections (screen flicker, etc as noted earlier) but overall I don't notice it much since I've installed Lux. I use it fairly often, and at this point I'm pretty happy I gave it a second chance. My one new issue is the camera, which is AWFUL quality pics. It's basically unusable except for video chats since it's front facing. I tried it with Instagram out of curiosity, and the picture quality was so bad that I realized it's not even worth messing with it. Slight annoyance, guess I'll stick to my iPhone for that. Other than these things, I now highly recommend the Nexus 7, especially the newer versions where they've probably worked out all the little quirks. Screw the iPad Mini.

tablet|I got one of these tablets, the 16gb model for my birthday. What an amazing piece of technology. Don't buy it from Amazon for $300 because Google sells them direct for $199-$249 depending on model. But for the price, this thing BLOWS AWAY the Kindle Fire (Sorry Amazon) and the Nook Tablet and even the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7". The quad core processor in this thing rivals that of my personal computer and I have comfortably overclocked my Nexus 7 to 1.7 ghz. This thing flies! There's no better 7" tablet on the market right now in any price range. Buy one (just not from here!)

tablet|I just got my Nexus 7 this week and it's really amazing. Fast, plays all the music, videos and movies I throw at it. As others have commented, it's a bit short on memory. So, yeah a micro SD slot would have been nice. However, there are some great workarounds. If you have access to wifi while you're using the device, you can take advantage of cloud storage. The nexus 7 integrates nicely with Google music and Google drive. Also, if you get yourself a USB on-the-go cable (link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FUNYSA/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00) you can attach a USB thumb drive for extra external storage. For me, the memory isn't really a problem.

tablet|I ordered this with high expectations and they were met! I chose this tablet after using several others including an ipad. The size fits great in my hands and purse. It synced to my google account seemlessly. The shipping was lightening fast too!

tablet|Hi - PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING THIS PRODUCT OR NEED A WARRANTY REPLACEMENT!! A (not so) brief note about my experience with the Google Nexus 7 and my experience with Google Customer Service. I purchased the Google Nexus 7 in September as a gift and loved it. Our device began having problems this week, battery not charging fully, and when the charge was low (and device was plugged in) the screen would flicker and could not power off completely and would not retain a charge. After a full 24 hours of charging the device and leaving it untouched, we were able to get a charge to turn it on. The speaker appears to be blown as the sound is completely broken coming from the device (grainy and crackling).When I called Google's Customer Service team, the ladies I spoke with were helpful and processed my WARRANTY EXCHANGE promptly and without question. When I asked the rep if I was getting a new or refurbished device, she advised it would be new, that they do not house or sell refurbished devices. Happy to hear that! When I asked specifically if I would be charged for the replacement device, she stated NO, there would not be a charge. When I received the link to "order" my replacement device, it brought me to the checkout page in Google Play and asked me to supply my credit card to PURCHASE a new device for the full price. I immediately called Customer Service and was given the standard rep response of "IT IS OUR POLICY" to put a hold on your credit card - in this case, my debit card - to have you PURCHASE a WARRANTY REPLACEMENT. Um, the last time I checked, I was not aware that companies can bill you in full for a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. I spoke with several layers of reps that were only able to reiterate their crappy customer service policies and procedures about the fact that the charge for a replacement Google Nexus 7 was required, or I could send my device back and allow their overseas tech team to troubleshoot, fix and send back to me. I find it hard to believe that there is not a single person working for Google that can remove the charge to replace their defective device. I am currently waiting for a manager to contact me after Christmas to most likely tell me the same.Hey Google - the reason why Apple is a market leader is because they do not charge you for a defective product replacement within its warranty. I truly love Google and its services, however, this experience and their rigid customer service policies are completely unacceptable. I hope someone reads this and can share a similar experience. I cannot be the only person who is feeling like this is unacceptable out there. The internet is a powerful tool and I am looking to ban together to get this great company to change the warranty policies of forcing you to put a hold on your hard earner cash to replace their defective devices.Customer Service is trying to tell me that an acceptable work around to my complaints are to contact Asus directly to ship my device to them and allow them to fix and send back to me. This is utterly unacceptable!Directly from their email: Thank you for contacting Google Play! We will contact shipping escalations to resolve your issue.Google offers advanced replacement warranty service where we place a temporary hold on your credit card.To obtain manufacturer Warranty support without a temporary hold on your credit, I recommend contacting ASUS directly using any of the support options at [...]. ASUS offers a same unit repair service for issues covered under warranty. They also offer repair services for issues not covered by the warranty.

tablet|I've been looking for an Android tablet quick enough to keep up with me since they started coming out. I've used a rooted nook color, the 8.9" Galaxy Tab, a 10" Galaxy Tab, and now the Nexus 7.The Nexus 7 has managed to combine some key usability elements that I didn't even previously realize were essential into a near perfect package.1. "Holdability" - I spend a lot of time lounging on my couch, laying down, or pacing around reading science/web articles or watching lecture videos. Over an extended period of time any device becomes uncomfortable to hold. Weight and dimensions can easily exacerbate the issue. The Nexus 7 is light enough to hold for much longer than any other tablet I've used. It's small enough to make one handed use (portrait and landscape) nearly effortless. I actually think that it's going to be a long time before technology makes anything larger than a 7" device light enough to use this comfortably. It's the whole lever arm bit from physics class. Longer levers amplify the amount of force. So a very light tablet becomes uncomfortable to hold with one hand if it's very large.2. Speed (The Zippiness Factor) - Android 4.1 (and now 4.2) with Project Butter has been the best new "feature" Google added to Android. Using the touch interface on the Nexus 7 is so fast and crisp that it's just plain fun to use. If you really want to make things fly I suggest a few minor setting modifications which I now do to every device: 1. Set animation speed to .5x or off in the Developer settings 2. The Nova Launcher application (free) seems much quicker than even the stock Jelly Bean Launcher (In look and feel - set all the animations to "Faster than Light"). These quick settings tweaks really make the tablet zip along.3. Portability (It has to fit in a pocket to be with you all the time) - This doesn't apply to skinny jeans but for average men's loose fit jeans or even a pair of dress slacks the N7 slips right into a pocket. You can carry it around with you all the time or quickly stow it away to free up both hands. Great for conferences/meetings where you don't need much but still want to have quick access to email/spreadsheets/presentations/articles just in case. Anything larger than the N7 just isn't portable enough for me to always have on hand without having to drag around a bag or awkwardly hold a laptop/larger tablet all day.Some drawbacks:Requires a wifi-connection (which I've gotten around in the case that I'm out and about by using my phone as a hotspot, the new 3G model is also an option if this is an issue for you)Small screen isn't ideal for watching movies with other people (e.g. on a plane trip) if you're using this as a movie-watching device during trips you might want a larger tabletScreen quality is only slightly above averageNo external storage (I recommend examining your storage needs carefully and ensuring 16GB or 32GB is sufficient, apps can end up taking up a lot of space)Summary:I love using this tablet. At this point it's practically an extension of my arm. I find I can do most tasks just as quickly as I could on even a desktop thanks to a solid set of productivity apps (Swiftkey, Tasks, Google's Apps, EZpdf, and Dropbox) and a very zippy and responsive user interface. I never feel like I'm waiting on the tablet. It zooms along so I can get things done and then enjoy surfing the internet and reading for fun.

tablet|I've owned a 16GB Nexus 7 since late July of 2012 and I use it nearly daily. I mainly use it as an e-reader, for web browsing, reading blogs and browsing social networking sites and it does an excellent job of that. The form factor in particular makes it good as a reading device, light-weight and easy to hold one handed. I don't do a lot of gaming, but this form factor seems to work pretty well for that as well.I've used Android since the HTC Hero I had on Sprint running Android 1.5, and I'm impressed with how much it's improved since then. Lag issues have largely been fixed, and the user interface is quite nice. I'm a huge fan of the virtual keyboard on this, it seems to register keystrokes pretty accurately, and the word prediction works really well. I run Swiftkey on my phone that's running Android Ice Cream Sandwich, but I think I actually prefer the new Jellybean keyboard. Being able to set up widgets on the home screen is something I particularly find useful, and it's something where all of the extra screen space comes in handy.Build quality seems to be pretty solid, and the screen, while not retina quality, is sharp and looks good. I would have liked for it to have expandable storage, but I don't store any video on it, and all of the audio I'm streaming off of the cloud from Spotify and Google Music.It is lacking in tablet apps, especially compared to the iPad. This isn't a deal breaker for me, because most of my usage is covered well by the existing apps, and the device is still small enough that smartphone apps don't look ridiculous on it. Depending on how you plan to use it, this may or may not be a problem, but I would expect anyone looking at smaller sized tablets, would likely use them similarly to how I use mine and would be just as satisfied. I had an iPad a while back, and while some of the apps were really cool, I liked Garageband in particular, they really weren't how I typically used it.It's a great device and an excellent value. For me, it's a 5 star device, but I've giving it 4 because the lack of tablet apps compared to iOS could be an issue for some.

tablet|It really is an awesome tablet, particularly for the price! In fact, my only gripes with it would be when comparing it to the 10" Asus Prime Infinity... the UI is more so the phone version of Android than the tablet version that you get on the larger tablet.Also, on the issue of price... why is Amazon charging so much more for it?! The 16 GB isn't too bad, but the price of the 8GB on here is WAY too high. I normally buy EVERYTHING on Amazon... but on this one, you may want to buy directly from Google.

tablet|I was given some Amazon Gift cards and I decided to get this Nexus 7. I am familiar with the Androis OS since I have an Xperia phone and this tablet is really a major upgrade. The unit comes with the latest OS Jellybean and is very fast. The specs are good that that you will be double checking the price tag again. With the best reasonable tablet on the market you can't be wrong with this one. I also have a Nook tablet and comparing the two the Nexus 7 is a full android tablet....and nothing beats that. No annoying interface which you hardly can customize except if you root it. The nexus 7 even without rooting can use a keyboard and mouse just plug in using the OTG cable and uou are good to go. The battery life is good enough since with normal usage (some internet brosing,chatting,music and playing) I am able to use it for a whole day. This unit is awesome since you can just drag and drop your music,photos and files on it. No need for waiting the Syncing to finish and you are not restricted to use just one pc just to copy your files. This is a great machine to those budget conscious. Overall its good and not just I Like it but I Love this device...i just hope my girlfriend doesn't take it from me :)

tablet|I love this tablet and use it very consistently. I will admit that I am not very experienced with tablets since this is my first one, which makes it so I have nothing to compare it to, but it also tells you about its simplicity, but that doesnt mean it has no customization. Andriod is very customizable. I'll start off by throwing out a few things that are pros and cons in my book.pros:Very solid product, comfortable to hold, and light.It has amazing battery life.The screen quality is right out superb for a $200ish tablet.It's a nexus, which causes you to get very prompt OS updates giving you the latest of Andriod.Speakers - they put out better sound then many laptops I have seen.It is very simple device to root.There are sleep covers for it so that it doesn't waste battery life when not in use.WiFi reception is good, not amazing, but good.Bluetooth works pretty well. I like using a Bluetooth speaker while using the shower to keep the tablet away from the steam.Charges & syncs using micro-usb so it is easier to find accessories.It normally is a pretty speedy tablet.With buying a simple, three dollar, app you can connect external storage, it doesn't even require rooting.It costs half as much as many comparable tablets benchmark wise making it a great deal.The back, as apposed to some tablets, is not a finger print magnet and it is not slippery.The Nexus is very comparable to the Kindle Fire HD but the nexus runs pure Andriod so it is much more customizable. With the Kindle Fire you are completely locked in Amazon's ecosystem unless you root it, but with the Nexus you can get the Google Play Store and then buy apps for Amazon, Nook, and such, so it gives you much more options.Neutral Comments:Size - seven inches is perfect for me. It may or may not be perfect for you, but it was for me.It runs Android which i like but it will depend on the person. The classic Andriod vs. iOS, which you'll have to decide for yourself which is best for your individual propose.It doesn't cost as much if you buy it from other retailers.Negative:It's a Nexus causing you to get very prompt updates, which sometimes are slightly buggy causing a little lag at times. You get to be used a little like a guinea pig at times. since the 4.2.1 update it has needed reboot two times, but before that it never had to. I am sure it is very temporary thing, and will be fixed soon.There is a lack of compatible apps, let alone optimized for the screen, but the Play Store is growing rapidly, so that's just a matter of time.Finally, I'd like to say, I have owned my tablet for three months and, overall, I am very pleased with it. The Nexus Seven is a good tablet for a mediocre tablet price. It is a solid device that I have recommended and will recommend to anyone in the seven inch tablet market.

tablet|I just got the Nexus 7 (16 GB) about two weeks ago and I love it. It is a perfect size for what I need it for. It is very fast, graphics are crisp and because both my cell phone (Motorola Droid) and the Nexus are Android they sinc up very nicely. The only issue that I have found is something that I might have learned if I would have done more research but honestly I didn't even think it could be an issue. The Nexus can not be hooked up to your TV or other monitor. I watch most of my TV through Netflix, Hulu or Crackle and I was looking forward to being able to stream HD videos through my Nexus onto my TV for the larger screen but with this device it can not happen. I really found this difficult to believe since my 2 year old Netbook is able to do it with a VGA cord but not my even smaller screened Nexus. I don't know if this is something that can be fixed with an update but if it can be fixed it needs to be. Other than this one issue which might not even be a problem for you, I have nothing bad to say about my Nexus.

tablet|Alright, starting off from when I first got my hands on the device when my best friend bought one, I held it and knew I wanted one. Before even touching the spec sheet on it, it just feels like a wonderfully made device. The slight curves of the edges make it feel much thinner. The large bezel is great because it allows a good grip on it without touching the screen. The texture on the back gives it good grip, and feels wonderful. I did not buy my N7 new, I bought it from my friend. Therefore, there are a couple problems with it that I cannot say for sure if they are actual defects or whatnot. The back plate or whatever you want to call it feels kind of flimsy near the top. When pressing down on the top edge, you can hear some creaking. Not a big issue. Another problem with the back is that there is a ridge along the left side edge. It feels as if the back is misaligned, and it kind of scrapes the hand. However, it is not major. The biggest flaw in it, is that there is a dead pixel which I know for a fact is a defect because it was there when my friend bought it brand new. So this is an issue I would keep in mind. That is all for any flaws. Time to move onto the experience using it. I never used it running a stock ROM, so you might have to take this with a few grains of salt. The experience with it for the past 2 months has been wonderful. Android runs smooth as butter, Google now is a siri-killer, and Jellybean overall is just amazing. The 16 GB is more than enough space if you are using Google music to store all your music. If you plan on gaming and storing music, you may have a bit of trouble with running out of space. But apart from the small space, its beautiful. The internet browsing is phenomenal, its great for shopping, reading news, checking sports scores, whatever you throw at it. Its great for checking Facebook or Google+ (if you are one of the few people who do), and Skype calls are good enough quality that the other person won't be asking you if you are melting. Front camera isn't anything special but its not a deal breaker either. Now I am an app hoarder and I have something close to 100 apps at a time, so there is a bit of a slowdown with that much going on. However, with the normal load of apps and games, it runs beautifully. Games run better than Usain Bolt with rocket shoes. I've seen no more than a few screen stutters or lags. You can send your compliments to the tegra 3 packed in there. Overall, if you are just a casual user of a laptop, you probably will have very little need for it with this tablet around. But if you need to type papers a lot or do spreadsheets, you may want a bigger tablet or get a keyboard. Otherwise, this tablet has my recommendation as the best small tablet around. Thank you for taking the time to read the review!

tablet|It is perfect for carrying on visits, vacations and to use at workshops, dominate and study groups to take notes. It is very easy to handle but it would be better with a USB slot of some kind.

tablet|The manufacturer admits they cut corners - it is why there is no rear facing camera. So, with that in mind, I *still* bought the Nexus 7. I thought Google would have enough QA to put its own name on a device.I am not a "Fanboy" of Apple or Google. I want devices that are innovative AND reliable. However, I do use the Google "portal" religiously: Gmail, Google Voice, Drive, Play, etc.The Nexus 7:My experience was bad. The device setup was fine, and has gotten much better since my hacked Nook Color and my rooted Froyo Optimus V. The N7 is quick and responsive; the interface is much better than the warmed-over iOS appearance.As soon as I powered the Nexus 7 down, the problems began. Some defect prevented the device - even with 75% battery - to be powered up without being plugged in. That was it. I will not carry a device that cannot be turned on without access to power; that defeats the purpose.After fifteen minutes on the phone with Google, I had an RMA. I want a refund, not another defect. (It is telling that Google doesn't have reviews on the Google Play Device site...)As another reviewer put it: you are buying the manufacturer, the device, and the service. And, frankly, all three for Google are sub-par. Today, I bought the Kindle Fire, and I know my Amazon experience will be much better, no matter what happens with the device.

tablet|I've tried ipad's of every generation, samsung galaxy tabs etc etc, but the nexus 7 is by far the best tablet i've ever used.

tablet|Nexus 7 reviewOverall, I love the size. That is, for my needs. Carrying around a 10" iPad is just too much, this thing can slide into a back pocket. While it's not the way I would carry it for the day, lol, but from the car to the football field or hockey rink it's perfect. I'm the treasurer for the fire dept. assoc. and use several spreadsheets all the time to keep track of the money. While a 10" screen would be nicer to view them on, this works pretty good. If I was looking for a tab for heavy work use, this would not be the one. But for someone who does not need one, but only wants the convenience of a quick portable device for general use, this is perfect. Works well as a reader weather using the Kindle app or the Play books reader. One negative for Google Books, is that you can't upload a book you "own" to it. Kindle allows you to upload books in the .mobi format that work well. Does browsing fast. Typing on it is smooth for emails or even slightly longer text entry. Has bluetooth if you choose to get a BT keyboard for travel or something. Seen a couple in action and they work well.I use it more now than my laptop at work, or even around the house for email, facebook, or looking up quick stuff. At this pricepoint I think it is a perfect solution for those that are not looking for a powerhouse, but more than a no name entry tab they could do without. I could see in not so many years to come, laptops taking a hit as things advance making the tabs more powerful.Positives:SIZELocation of power button..upper left hand corner, so, unlike the kindle fire that is on the bottom, when you rest it in your lap it does not go to sleep.Chrome browser - not a big fan, but it works well with the tab. Guess if I was a desktop Chrome user I would love it. No Flash, but there are workarounds with Firefox mobile. Not a big loss since Flash is dying out.It seems to sense really well where you are about to click on. I think that was part of the Butter side of the OS. At first it was almost too quick for me, since I was hesitating before deciding on what to click on. Now, it is awesome. Very fast, very responsive.Graphics....While it is not a Retnia display I'm pleased. Browsing is nice, pics look good. Where it really comes in to play is games. Any tegra enabled game - google some you tube vids - are awesome. Great looking graphics with no studdering or lag that I can detect.Google Now....While I don't use it that much, I can see this feature only getting better. If you were still traveling to work, it would be a huge asset to you. As they add more "cards" to it I'll be loving it. I wish my phone had it, it would be perfect there. Which is what I think it was intended for anyhow. Worked great - when I had a wifi connection- on our recent trip. The flight updates were right on, except about 10 mins. behind from the updates we were getting at the gate. Not to bad of a lag from the live thing.Negatives:The Glass is not Gorilla glass, just a scratch resistent corning type. reports of it being easily scratched. However, I went 2 weeks without a shield or cover and have no scratches. Of course, I was careful. I now have a slim cover from Amazon that puts it to sleep when it is closed. I now have a slim, low profile case. No shield. Still no scratches, however it collects finger prints like crazy. You have to keep the screen clean or it will start glitching with the touches.WIFI - seems to have a problem holding a signal. I'm 70' if that from my router and it is a weak signal. Read many reports of the same. Seems to be less of an issue recently, but it is noticeable, and annoying considering my phone on wifi is right next to it and shows a stronger signal. Could be a hardware issue, but I'm hoping to see a software update. Time will tell.Glass edge....reports that is loose on one side, or raised up. Not a big deal other than it is not perfect. There are fixes, and mine is a little raised, but you really have to look to tell, or push on that edge to notice the movement. Does not effect function. First run problem, and it is a $200 tab. Mine has not gotten any worse and there is no effect on use.HEAT - our kindle fire runs hot, noticeably hot with extended use. The N7 was reported to not have any heating...lol...same as fire when being held bare handed. Can not tell with cover installed. Does not effect performance.RAM - I have the 16gb version. $50 more totally worth it over the 8gb for me. I want to be able to have a gig of music stored locally on it, some larger games, and a couple of movies for traveling with the kids. The 8 would be overloaded. Most are reporting regrets getting the 8gb version. Read a 32gb version was coming out in the UK, but have not seen anything "official" If there was a larger version when I was ready to buy I would spend the extra to get it. With the 16 I have not had any space issues, and that is with a book, apps, and 4 episodes of Game of Thrones in HD.Ergonomics - While it is lighter than the kindle fire which is awesome. I don't like the corners. Holding it as a reader without a cover would hurt my hand. The corners are rounded and tapered to the back so it can be easily picked up while it is on it's back....fine...but when you hold it by...say...the lower corners like a book, the corner soon begins to dig into the middle of your palm. Not a deal breaker, but annoying when I'm reading a book for a long period of time. Totally solved by putting it into a cover. Other than that minor personal annoyance, it's light, has a good size bezel so that holding it by the edges does not result in a touch on the screen you didn't intend for. The case has totally eliminated the corner problem for me.

tablet|You can buy the 16GB on google play for $199 (google recently dropped the price)[...]This tablet is exceptional for the form factor. I see myself using this more frequently than my ipad for consuming content. My only gripe would be no expandable storage which might seem like a big deal if you are really into using this tablet for high end games.Thats why I bough the 32GB one (selling at $249 at google play) and gave my 16GB to my wife.She has fallen in love with it but still calls it ipad :/

tablet|The Nexus 7 is a very powerful platform, responsive, easy to use. The display is good. Battery life is good as well. 7" is easy to hold, hands don't get tired even during reading e-books. The only thing I miss is the HDMI output. Apart from that, I believe Google (Asus) sets a really high price/performance ratio with this product. Summa summarum, I am very pleased, my kids like it very much!

tablet|I absolutely recommend this to anyone who is confused by the tablet choices. The Nexus delivers what it promises, it delivers crisp clear graphics. The video quality is HD compatible and you can watch movies on the Nexus without skippipng, pixelation, or choppiness. The sound quality is best with earbuds and you can load apps to turn the screen down to a low glow while reading e-books. The processor is one of the best on the market and it definately competes with Apple products; for the value, this exceeds anything Apple has to date includeing their new tablet. I've tried other tablets: Kindle Fire, Sony, Toshiba, Dell, Samsung (which is what I would have purchased if the Nexus hadn't been developed) and passed. I have an iPad which is in a class by itself, but I've been impressed with the Nexus right out of the box and have not lost my interest since.

tablet|Whatever I can do on my computer, I can do on the Nexus 7. Facebook, YouTube, E-mail, Word, Excel, Google Chrome, Angry Birds, Scanner Radio, etc, etc, etc.I can print documents and e-mail over my LAN.Fast, responsive, nice resolution and bright. I love listening to Pandora with a good pair of headphones. Audio is excellent! The Nexus 7 is just awesome!

tablet|Was a couple of days past the short 15 day window that Google will take a Nexus 7 back. I was moving during that time and didn't have a chance to check out the device. I spoke with three people with Google and they were not understanding at all. Don't use the packaging slip to find all of the information needed to return or exchange - you have to log into Google Play and then browse through apps and every other purchase until you find the actual device purchase for all of the required information. This could easily have been included on the packaging slip that comes with the shipping material.No flash support. Even the hacks to try to get flash do not work reliably with many freezes/crashes. The screen in the middle of one side of the device is detaching from the bezel. Is isn't too bad yet but this shabby build quality makes me question the long term viability of a $250 device (16 GB version) that I could have purchased a bare bones PC with. It is only a deal if it functions and lasts right? So far quite unhappy with the product and can't refund. Might look to exchange if the screen keeps peeling back.

tablet|This device is a great solution for a quick way to bridge the divide between your couch and the internet. It has decent battery life. I use the device for an average of 2 hours a day and it lasts 2-3 days while leaving the WiFi on during sleep. 4G would be a welcome option as it is quite a portable device. Fortunately, the lack of 4G is more than made up for by the speed, high resolution display, and the price. Good,The Good,1. The Nexus 7 is very fast. I do not notice any lag even if I have a number of widgets and a really active live wallpaper.2. The screen resolution and graphics are great. Games designed for the Tegra 3 look better than my Xbox 360.3. Nexus branded devices get the newest version of Android first.4. The price is great.The bad,1. It's so light and portable I find myself really wishing it had 3g/4g.2. Even though it has great resolution sometimes I find content can get a bit compressed on the small 7" screen.3. Most of the apps for Android tablets are still designed for phones. Apps do a good job of adapting to the larger screen but don't take advantage of the increased real estate to add funtionality. (This should change over time as Android tablets become more popular and developers start taking advantage of the larger screens.)Bottom Line,This device is the best 7" tablet if you are looking to cruze the internet recreationally or if you are looking to play games. I would recommend for flights but not for ground travel as it has no 4G. If you add a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse the tablet can replace most tasks that used to require a computer (See image of my setup under the Amazon images for the device.)Feel free to comment if you have any specific questions.

tablet|What a great tablet !! Almost 1/3 the price of the iPad 3 & seems to work even faster.Yes, it's a 7", but who needs more + it is MUCH lighter & more comfortable to hold(did I mention your holding hand doesn't get tired after a while ?)I have iPad 2 at home - will not buy future Apple unless they really have some technological breakthrough.(changing the product's serial number from 2 to 3, from 4 to 5 ,etc. does not count as a real improvement...)In short : why buy the old king when you can have the beautiful princess for much less ?????long live the (future) Queen !

tablet|It was time for my first tablet. I considered an iPad 3, however I was definitely not in the market to spend $400+. And since my primary use was supposed to be reading, I took into account that a 7-inch tablet was far more comfortable to hold and carry (based on reviews).Fast-forward to today, about 2 weeks after using the Nexus 7, and I am SO impressed and couldn't be happier with my decision! I am a tech-savvy guy that has used iPhones, Android devices, Windows computers, etc, and I have yet to find anything that is missing from or wrong with the Nexus 7 and its current Android OS. The last time I used an Android device was my HTC Droid Incredible (Android version 2.1), so Android JellyBean 4.1 (incorporating Project Butter) is a VAST improvement and it has absolutely surpassed my expectations. Swiping screens on the Nexus 7 is perfectly smooth and fluid, just like the iPad!Aside from the OS, I love the form factor of the tablet, the weight seems just right, the microphone is very sensitive and Google Voice picks up everything. Reading on this tablet (especially in night-mode (black background, white text) is a very pleasurable experience; I'm actually excited to read books and learn! I'm also impressed that it houses a quad-core processor, so i'm comfortable it can handle anything. There are no physical problems with my unit; everything is flush and seamless. The speaker doesn't seem that loud, but I have no other tablet experience to compare it to. I also haven't bothered to use the camera except to try out the face unlock feature (neat feature as well!). I won't be needing to use a camera on my tablet for anything yet.* And with the price being approximately $249 for the 16GB version, I feel like I own one of the highest quality tablets out there without paying a fortune!Also, not to knock Apple and its OS (the iPhone is amazing), but I really have become bored with the Apple OS and its stale grid of icons and usual menu layouts. It's really refreshing to use the Android OS and be able to do different things. I am really looking forward to the future of Android :)

tablet|I'm going to add to this from time to time because there are many small positive features that could go unnoticed unless you really think about them. Especially with the operating system.>Transitions from app to app is smooth and lag free. Closing apps is lag free. No ridiculous effects, just subtle transitions that unless you really pay attention, you won't notice them and that's a good thing. The OS shouldn't be distracting. It should complement the user experience. So I guess this would fall under project butter.>Con: browser pages don't always render smoothly. Scrolling can be slow and jerky. Even scrolling from home page to home page is not very sensitive.>Multitasking Very convenient to use the task manager soft button on the bottom. It allows me to easier switch from one app to another. The apps have small thumbnails and are either in a vertical or horizontal list depending on tablet orientation. Flick the thumbnails to get rid of the apps. Very easy to use.>Con: still can't have like to apps running side by side. Split screen with two apps on the screen together doesn't work. You can't re size windows.>Chrome I think this is a feature of chrome. It might be, I'm not sure. There is a feature when if you want to click on a hyperlink and there are hyperlinks in close proximity, to prevent you from clicking on the wrong one unintentionally, a small popup will show the area magnified so that you can click on your link easier. It's convenient and really considerate.>Con: I'm not sure if this is a fault, but more of an inconvenience. Even though this is a tablet, I really want to use this as a replacement for my dead laptop. So therefore, when I use it to browse the web, I want it to be accepted as a desktop instead of a mobile device. I can't remember which site I was on, but I wanted to complete a task on my Nexus 7 but the website said that I have to use my desktop to complete the action. I'm not sure if there's a work around for this, but it's happened a few times.>Battery Life Wow. The Nexus 7 has better battery life than my dead Asus EEE PC HE1000 netbook and that was a champ in battery life, too. I haven't had a chance to run down the battery but I can estimate that it'll at least last for 8 hours. I even have a live wall paper running in the back ground, with wifi on always and GPS. Screen brightness at about 50%. Very cool.Con: I believe it uses a microUSB port which doesn't seem to be compatible with any of my old power cords haha. I usually have pretty good luck with using old phone power cords with my new ones as back ups or on trips. However, the Nexus 7 won't work with my HTC Rezound cord, which sucks because the cord is about 3 feet long! The charging cord for the Nexus 7 is a little shorter than I would like it to be.>Sharing It seems like whatever app I'm using, whether it's a photo app, the browser, Evernote, Gmail, etc. I have a ton of options to share my data. Cloud storage is easily accessible. Mostly everything works together seamlessly. Notifications are instantaneous. Uploading Evernote data takes seconds. It's just a very fast, connected device.>Cons: USB drives are not compatible with On The Go OTG adapters unless you root the device. I'm not terribly confident in my rooting abilities, probably due to my failures to root the Droid X I have. You can use a wireless key board and mouse without rooting. Just need the OTG adapter.>Voice Search It has come a long way. It worked about 50% of the time on my Droid X. It faired a little better with my Rezound. Then when the Rezound got updated to Ice Cream Sandwich, it improved greatly. With Jelly Bean, it's a joy to use. Even with my Western New York nasally accent, the voice recognition software gets me right nearly all the time. The only problem is I forget what I wanted to search in the first place I get nervous and I turn it off haha. I just voice searched Museums in Buffalo, New York and up came a "card" with a small google map of all of the museums in the area and a lettered list of the seven most popular museums in Buffalo. Then if you scroll down a bit, you get a regular google search results page. I'm sure if I lived in a larger city, it would be more useful to me in regards to metro schedules and traffic information.>Con: Google Now This feature will be AMAZING in a year or two. Right now, it's in it's infancy. Google Now is supposed to learn more about you and provide you with pertinent information on the go instantly and depending on your situation. It would probably work better with a phone that has mobile data. Also, it prides itself on giving you an audio answer of a sports score for your favorite team. It works for the Yankees but not the Buffalo Bills. I suppose that means my team needs to be more relevant!>Display Nice display. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. Imagine it with a pentile display! That would have sucked. The touchscreen is responsive enough for me. Widgets look good on it. I like how the soft keys dim out when reading an Ebook (they change into a very small black dot, so they dont completely disappear, they just become less noticeable). The soft keys rotate with the screen, which is nice. The soft keys are3 responsive.>Con I sometimes get a black vertical line flash on my screen, especially when reading something on a static page for sometime, with a white background. Kind of makes me nervous there's something wrong with it.>Notifications are very cool. They dont take up the whole screen, they go down about 3/4 of the way, the background dims out, notifications now have icons next to them. You get a preview of emails, texts, tweets etc. Much more information at hand than with previous iterations of the notification menu.>Con: Noneother observations:Speakers are loud enough.Good build quality. There is some creaking when I press down on the left or right edge of the front. Also, i can feel the screen depress when I press on the left or right edge. The back feels really good in the hand, good soft grip to it. Very attractive looking.Cameras is useless. The face unlock feature is ineffective. it rarely recognizes me. have yet to use it for video chat.Screen shots are easy tot ake when holding volume and power buttons at the same time.Volume and power buttons are easy to press down. Good tactile feel to them.No HDMI port out. Thats a shame because it plays netflix movies and shows very nicely.I prefer a vertical scrolling app drawer to the horizontal app drawer on the Nexus 7. I could use a third party home screen launcher to change that, though. i also miss being able to access widgets by long pressing on the screen. cant do that on the Nexus 7.it locks onto WiFi quickly. havent used bluetooth yet. it also has NFC, ahvent used that yet, either.I'll add more as I use it more!

tablet|I've watched Apple release their tablets as well as many many others have but once I heard Google announce the Nexus 7 I preordered immediately after I saw the I/O demonstration. It is very responsive, I have Bluetooth keyboard, mouse, headset, everything works great. Only down side is they only used it to compete with the kindle so there was not any external storage, no retina display, this is just a great tablet with easy access, easy to use, i love every moment i use it. Voice command... EXCELLENT! very responsive, easy easy to use of course just like sirus it does not recognize everything but the more you use it the more they can improve it. I HIGHLY recommend this tablet to anyone looking for one. I am an IT technician and I recommend this tablet to anyone who asks me.

tablet|I purchased the Nexus 7 three weeks after its announcement. To cut straight to the point, it is an incredible tablet. It's a great size, great weight, and it wants to be picked up and held. The major flaws in this device is that I would prefer the 32 GB model for more storage of documents and games, and the tablet-optimized apps are small but are finally picking up. I have broken this down to the type of user you are so you know what to expect from the tablet.Web and FacebookWeb browsing on the tablet is pretty good with the preloaded applications. A faster browser that I just discovered is Dolphin with Jet Pack. This is available in the market and makes the browsing experience much faster minus the great syncing services that are baked into Chrome. Chrome itself has great functionality as well, but can be a little laggy on media rich sites especially when you are pinching and zooming. If you are looking for a companion for the couch, look no further. The Facebook application has also received some huge improvements as far as functionality and speed go. It's not as slick as the Google+ app, but nobody uses Google+, so I'm going to move on.GamingGaming on this device is incredible. After all, NVidia made the GPU. You get console quality in a thing and light package. Gaming will eat your battery significantly more than normal use, but that's what you get when you have 60 fps on the game of your choice. Big names that I have played and enjoyed on this tablet is Dead Trigger (zombie shooter), Need For Speed: Most Wanted (self explanatory), Horn (much like Zelda, but it uses the touchscreen elegantly), and Galaxy on Fire 2 (space ship shooter). There are many more that this tablet can play and many more on their way. You won't get as high PS3 graphics, but you sure won't get as low as Wii graphics either. With games, your major problem will be with storage as each game can take up anywhere from .5 to 2 GB of memory that can eat through your 16 GB quickly if you use this for other things.ReadingThe pixel density on the screen makes reading a breeze. I read Kindle books, Play books, and Walking Dead comics on the bus while I'm commuting and I'm very happy with it. When you are using it in a dark room, the auto brightness can be finicky, but the 4.2 settings pane has easy access to manual brightness controls. I recommend using your library's digital collection to save you money and keep you reading. Play Books are overpriced as are the Play Magazines. If you really want to get a good magazine, you can pay for it, but there may also be 30 day trials to give you a taste of the experience. The Currents app is a fantastic additional to a readers arsenal. You select the sources that you want in your own digital newspaper, and it will sync automatically or on command so you can read on the go without a network collection. This is how I get up to date on all the latest.FlyingThere may be a small niche of you who are wondering how this is when you are literally flying an airplane. I was fortunate enough to learn to develop HTML5, so I made a great digital checklist for my school's planes. I use my checklist app alongside Garmin Pilot, Write, and an E6B app for when I'm flying. Garmin is still growing up, but the application that they have is very good and utilizes the built in GPS on the Nexus 7. Also, you can preload sectionals, instrument procedures by state, and any other chart that you need minus the actual AF/D exerpts. The application uses AOPA to transcribe the AF/D which may be fine for some, but not for others. Other than that, the size is great. It fits neatly as a kneepad with the right case and strap, but keeps me informed of my ETA, GS, MH, and cross track. The only problem with the size of the screen is that it is smaller than approach plates, so the size is scaled down slightly requiring you to pinch and zoom if necessary.ConclusionI'm surprised how much I have ditched my computer to use my table instead. The integration with Google services such as Gmail and Drive is so great that my backpack is rarely used if I am to go to school. It won't be a good desktop replacement if you type or produce a lot of features, but if you only use your computer to browse the internet and listen to music, look no further. I see this as a companion to the rest of my life. With such a mobile size, I use it much more than I though I would have. A 10" tablet is too big in my opinion and I debated taking it with me anywhere and it would require me to rest it on something to use for a long time. The 7" size is a no brainer for me, since it can fit in my back pocket with a case on, and I can use it comfortably by holding it with one hand for hours. If you are looking for a tablet of any size, I'd recommend the Nexus 7. I just recommend going for the 32 GB model if you plan on gaming or storing music.

tablet|Google Nexus 7 Tablet (16 GB)The left side of the screen is not secured in the frame. If you look at my nexus 7 from the right side, the thing is flat but if you look from the left side, you will notice that my nexus 7's middle part pops out. That's what I say about "screen is not secured in the frame".Sorry I forgot to mention that so far, despite the hardware problem, the device is working very well!

tablet|Didn't know quite what to expect...going from a laptop to a tablet, but I couldn't be happier. Super easy to use and has been great so far.

tablet|I like all those things which has proved the greatest Steve Jobs wrong or even has potential of doing it. Because such things has to be something beyond the greatest. Examples: (i) Software and hardware has to go together: Windows and PC proved it wrong. Then again Android proved it wrong. (ii) Touch devices with stylus dead on arrival: Galaxy Note proved it wrong. (iii) Who reads books? First Kindle proved him wrong. (iv) Tablet of smaller than 10 or 9 inch screens are of no use.AND THEN COMES NEXUS 7 TO PROVE HIM WRONG AGAIN.IN SHORT ITS GAME CHANGER OR TREND SETTER, AFTER THIS DEVICE, SMALLER SIZED TABLETS MIGHT BECOME FASHION AND GO HEAD TO HEAD OR EVEN FAR THAN THEIR BIGGER BROTHERS.MARK MY WORD : YOU WILL USE LESSER BIGGER SIZED TABLETS OR LAPTOP FOR THAT MATTER ONCE YOU HAVE IT.IT'S ALWAYS MORE FUN TO PLAY WITH YOUNGER ONES RATHER.Now please proceed to the detailed review of this great device (this deserve it)1. VERY BEAUTIFUL DEVICE: SIMPLE, SLEEK, SEXY AND LIGHTWEIGHT. ITS LIKE APPLE DEVICE MINUS ALUMINUM IN BACK FOR HALF OF THE MONEY.2. MOST PORTABLE AND CONVENIENT TO USE AND CARRY. BEST FOR CASUAL USAGE: Its just like novel which you can put in pocket and use it any convenient position. Nothing beats it in this regard. People are using it even for serious work.3. VERY POWERFUL.4. VERY SMOOTH AND POLISHED OPERATING SYSTEM equivalent to iOS but more powerful, flexible and customizable. It puts YOU IN COMMAND and don't let you feel helpless or dumb. You can do the things when you have the need for it.5. VERY GOOD SCREEN resolution (216 PPI). Viewable from all angles.6. STOCK ANDROID: BELIEVE ME NOTHING COMPARES TO STOCK ANDROID EXPERIENCE. With other variations you will most likely be outdated for some duration at least and that too with inferior UI.7. COMPARED TO KINDLE DEVICES: ITS BETTER than those as you can have amazon ecosystem on this but not vice-versa. Kindle ecosystem is very limiting.8. PRETTY DECENT SPEAKERS for its size.9. Very well integrated with Google ecosystem.10. GOOGLE ECOSYSTEM IS MORE CONSUMER FRINEDLY IN GENERAL, they have more free, FEATURE RICH applications (almost double). They have recently offered many popular applications free or just for a quarter. I have bought one application @25 cents which otherwise comes for almost 14 dollars. Unlike Apple, Google is not making any money on the hardware as they want to earn on its usage. Remember Apple steals your hard earned money first on hardware then on 'limited' usage too.11. Make no mistake its BEST VALUE FOR THE MONEY: If Apple replaces its plastic back with Aluminum IT WILL BECOME AN APPLE DEVICE and they will charge gold for an aluminum. And mind you plastic here is better here for its does not feel slippery.12. FRONT CAMERA: NO COMPLAINT for what it is made for.It could be better in the following areas:1. Expandable SD (Workaround : by OTG cable in less than dollar and use it with nexus media importer for $2.49 [workks without rooting]) AND PRACTICALLY YOU CAN UNLIMITED STOARGE ON YOUR DISPOSABLE and you can swich/detach/exchange on your will.2. No Flash: This fault is not of Android/Google as Adobe itself is not supporting Flash anymore. (Workaround: Free Puffin web browser [works without rooting])3. No HDMI (Buy any micro USB to HDMI adaptor). I personally don't feel need for it though.4. No Cellular connectivity: Not a big deal as 8 out of 10 tablets sell just with wifi. And you are saving money on hardware and data plan. I tether with my unlocked nexus phone without paying a single penny.5. Speaker sound is little muffled on high volume (use any free EQ application).6. Back Camera: I don't care as I don't want to steer tablet to take photos I want to shoot photos.GOLDEN WORDS IN END: ITS BEST MONEY FOR THE VALUE AND GAME CHANGER DEVICE, GO FOR IT.TIP: BUY IT FROM STAPLES/OFFICE DEPOT/SEARS/WALMART. Seems they have much lesser complaints about quality. We three friends bought this and we are much more than satisfied. Its one of our best purchase so far.

tablet|The Nexus 7 is the best This is one of the most amazing tablets ever. I don't know if we should call it a tablet. It's that amazing. This is good for adults, teens, and kids love it too. It's only 7 inches so it's very portable. It is extremely light and has a very big screen. Setup is easy and if you sign up for Google Plus using the tablet you get $25.00 for the Play store. It has one ability that no other tablet does. You hold down the home key and slide up and you go straight to Google. Downloads are quick and easy though. One problem, it is very sensitive so treat it with care. I bought mine from a relative a little while ago and it looks and works like new. I love the fact that it has Jelly Bean software on it. Super fast connection and more games from the Play Store. I loved the way it looked. When I bought it, it wasn't too bad. Only $200.00 for it with no updates needed. I love it and so will you.

tablet|This is the first tablet I have had; I did have a Kindle Fire, but I don't really count that as a "tablet" unless it's rooted. I actually sold my 6 month old, rooted, Kindle Fire for $150 bucks and then just chipped in the difference to buy this.This tablet is perfect FOR ME and for what I need. iPads are great devices, I've used them in the store and some of my friends have them, but they aren't for me for many reasons. I have had iPhones and iPods and MacBook Pros, but I just prefer the Android OS. I'd still choose an Apple computer anyday over a PC, though.Again, this device is great for me. One of the biggest reasons I got it was because I recently started graduate school and I bought the e-textbooks this semester rather than hard copy. For some odd reason, the programme I needed to run my e-textbooks was not compatible with the Kindle Fire, so I constantly needed to be near Wi-Fi in order to read them. Now, I can download them directly to my device and have them handy whenever I want.If you're going to get this device I would suggest getting a keyboard to go along with it, the one I bought is a case and keyboard all in one.There are a few downsides, but nothing that would have caused me not to buy the Nexus 7. FIRST, it does not support Adobe Flash player unless you upload it yourself, but then again neither does the iPad. Even when you do upload the Adobe Flash player app yourself it doesn't work all that wonderfully anyway. SECOND, there is no SD expansion slot. I wish this feature was available, but it's not. That being said, if you aren't downloading or storing a lot of high quality videos or photos onto your device you should be okay. There are ways to hookup mini hard drives to the device, so don't worry too much about this. Each of my textbooks, the entire textbook, takes up 11MB at the most. THIRD, the screen is not made of Gorilla Glass 1 or 2 thus making a case a necessity!All in all this is a good device, you have to put things in perspective. This device cost about 1/2 the price of the lowest price iPad, so they're obviously not going to have the same features. If the Nexus 7 has what you need then get it, if not then go for another Android device or an iPad. The Nexus 7 is not for everyone.

tablet|Nexus 7 is a great tablet, especially for the price. Native Ice Cream Sandwich. Not sure why anyone would buy it here for $50 more rather than go directly through Google and get the same product for $250.

tablet|This tablet is a piece of junk. I got one for Christmas 2012 and it was defective out of the box. So I send it back to Amazon, and I could only get a store credit and not a full refund. So I say "ok", get the store credit and purchase another Nexus 7. Wouldn't you know, less than two weeks after I get the new unit, it craps out on me again. Now, it won't turn on at all. So, I have to send it back for another store credit. This product is junk, don't waste your money on it. Definitely don't get it from Amazon, the unit is sold by an Amazon dealer, so you can't get your money back if you need to return the unit.

tablet|I bought the Nexus 7 direct from Google when it went on sale in July of this year. It's an absolute great value at $199. The $249 asking price was viewed as suspect even back then because it's a $50 markup for 8GBs of flash storage. Just for the sake of comparison a 8GB SD card can costs as little as $5 and change. Even the more pricey cards I've seen weren't more than $14. But still, the N7 is a 7 inch quadcore Tegra3, 720p tablet that ships with Jellybean (Android 4.1) and gets first-in-line support direct from Google...for $199 - $249. It's a sexy proposition even with the newly announced iPad Mini. Summary...The positives -- Runs the latest stock Android with support direct from Google- Supports full customization and apps that Android allows with no UI skin and no excuses.- Incredible value for the price between $199 - $249- 720p HD screen- 7 inch form factor is very convenient- Runs smooth- Good battery life (over 9 hours)The negatives -- There's no microSD (mSD) card slot- $50 markup for 8GBs of flash storage- Build quality is suspect with many units. There's issues with the left side of the screen coming a bit loose from the housing.- There's no MHL support to go HDMI out from the N7 to a receiver or HDTV. (see Nexus Q for the reasons why)- Google is going to announce a 32GB Nexus 7 for $249 in a few days, effectively burning anyone that bought the $249 16GB N7 3 months ago.Final word - There is a lesson that many people must keep in mind when using Android. If you can help it all at, only buy non carrier branded Nexus devices. This is to guarantee that you get first in line support direct from Google for at least 18 months, it also guarantees that you will get a pure Android device without any UI skins, carrier bloatware (apps) or modifications included. The Nexus 7 is a great device that suffers from the lack of expandable storage and shipping with only 16GBs max (currently, this will change very soon). It also suffers from build issues resulting in some devices that creaks on the left side of the screen. Because of this, it's not a 5* device even for the phenomenal price. But it is hands down one of the best tablets you can buy at this form factor, not just the best Android tablet. Although the Nook Tablet is excellent and the Kindle HD Fire deserves a nod, the problem with these devices is that they run a skinned (read: not pure) version of Android. There are key features these devices will simply not have that the N7 does. Examples being, Google Play access, Google sync, Google apps, Google support. Support for these devices are suspect at best But the N7 can still support Barnes and Noble and Kindle features through their apps.Close to perfect but not quite. Still the N7 is the tablet to beat for the price.

tablet|I bought the Google Nexus 7 tablet and it arrived very quickly and as described. I tossed the packaging after two weeks. Two days later, a black line of dead pixels runs across the screen about two inches below the camera. It doesn't always react to my fingertips. Don't bother with facial recognition, a pimple threw it off.
---
tablet|If you let your battery completely die it will not recharge, it will not even turn on. There is a way to restart the normal charging process being promoted by Nexus, but at least in my case it failed and still wouldn't charge. This was a gift purchased for my parents for Christmas and I am glad I bought the extended warranty. This sounds like a major issue for Nexus 7's and I will send this in for repair every time it happens until they either fix this so it no longer happens or offer a full refund including the cost of the extended warranty. Knowing what I know now, I would purchase a Samsung Galaxy. The Galaxy was out of stock when I went to purchase it, so instead I settled for this, big mistake.
---
tablet|I spent good money on this product for my daughter for Christmas and she was very disappointed when taking it brand new out the box and it wouldn't charge or hold a charge. I'm sending it back and hope they refund my money so I can choose a different brand tablet.
---
tablet|I had this for a littlie while and enjoyed it, up until the very first time it fell. A very short fall of almost no distance at all, and had a couple chunks of screen break off, and what's left of the screen is completely unresponsive. Additionally, to get it fixed costs nearly the price of a completely new device. Checking online it seems other people have had the same issue and believe it's the result of possibly not being manufactured quite right.

tablet|GENERAL-The Nexus 7 earns an 8 out of 10. It has fantastic hardware and software, but the build quality is not quite up to par, and it is lacking some almost essential features. Here are the specs:Display Type LED-backlit IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen, 16M colorsSize 800 x 1280 pixels, 7.0 inches (~216 ppi pixel density)Multitouch YesProtection Corning GlassSOUND Alert types N/ALoudspeaker Yes3.5mm jack YesMEMORY Card slot NoInternal 16/32 GB storage, 1GB RAMDATA GPRS NoEDGE NoWLAN Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/nBluetooth YesNFC YesUSB Yes, microUSB v2.0CAMERA Primary 1.2 MPFeatures Video-callingVideo Yes, 720pSecondary NoOS Android OS, v4.1 (Jelly Bean), v4.2, upgradable to v4.2.1Chipset Nvidia Tegra 3CPU Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A9GPU ULP GeForceSensors Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compassMessaging Email, Push Email, IM, RSSBrowser HTMLRadio NoGPS YesJava NoColors BlackBUT WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN?The Nexus 7 is the first tablet made by Google. It has stock Jellybean, a plus for all users who hate bloatware. It packs a punch with the Quad-core Tegra 3. You can count on smooth multitasking and great graphics, especially for optimized games. Then there are some mediocre things about the Nexus 7, like the screen. It is fine and does its job, but doesn't make you excited about it.There is a lot of controversy about screenlift, on the outside of the glass. The edge of the glass seems to "Pop out" andit squeaks when you press on it. It can get annoying, but you can send it back to where you got it from.Where it does lack is some key features, a card slot and a back-facing camera. Google did want the costs to be low, so you will not have a microSD card slot. This means you are stuck with the space you get. This is not a dealbreaker, for you can use the cloud for movies, books, etc. The camera would be nice too have, there are times where I wish I had a back-facing camera on my Nexus 7. For me, these two are not dealbreakers. They would be nice to have, but all the other benefits outweigh the negatives.ONE SCENTENCE REVIEWIf you want a 7 inch tablet, get the Nexus 7 because of its super fast hardware and stock android, or the Kindle Fire HD and it's custom Amazon experience.

tablet|I've got this tablet as a gift. As people say, you don't check the gift horse's teeth. Well, I did anyway. Not surprisingly, found few rotten ones. Hence this review. Sorry if it comes out as a bit of unpolished - it's my first foray as these things go. Now to the subject itself, in a promised order.The good:I finally realized that 7" is a perfect size. Size matters here, just like in all kinds of aspects of life. I own older generation Kindle and iPhone, which I often used as reading devices. Now I find myself mostly going with Nexus when it comes to reading. The reasons are simple - I can't read Kindle in the dark, and iPhone is just too small to fit enough of the text, but it is perfectly usable even in dark confines of a closet (not that I often find myself there, but still...). Nexus combines the advantages of both in one package. The screen is bright and sharp. It's fast and responsive, as the touch screen devices go. Especially when compared to my (ancient) iPhone 3GS (yest, it is a low bar, but still). Aesthetically pleasing design helps. I am a stickler to the details, so it is important for me. Not quite an iPad level, but then you pay half the price, so it does give an iPad run for its money. Speaking of money - I didn't pay for it, but someone I care did, and I like the idea of enjoying something without feeling guilty for accepting an overly expensive gift and emptying someone's wallet in the process.The bad:Feels a bit too heavy, particularly after holding it for awhile in one hand. To preempt your counterarguments, let me be clear - I do work out regularly - so no, it's not my feeble arm to blame here. It is certainly heavier than my Kindle, so try it out before you get one. Alternatively, hit the gym now. Actually, exercise regularly even if you have the lightest of the devices - it's good for you. Sorry, got carried away. Let's refocus and continue. Software. I have a major beef with it. Yes, I like beef in general, but not this kind. Facebook did not work for a good part of the first month. Could be that it is FB to blame here, but, truthfully, I don't care who is the guilty party. What I care about is that it is a major app, and it MUST work on the device. Never before did I have issues of that kind in a device. I was annoyed. I tried to fix it, to no avail. It works now, I think after one of the updates, but the aftertaste of that experience still lingers in the dark corners of my mind. Overall experience with the software is similar - it kind of works, with small glitches here and there. I guess I have high expectations when comparing with my old iPhone iOS, but YES, I do like things working all the time and every time. I am not computer illiterate Luddite, but neither am I an IT specialist, so these kinds of issues bother me more than others. No one have to be a computer engineer to make things work.The ugly:It has a built-in front facing camera, but at this point it has only a cosmetic value. It just does not work. Period. I tried all I have in my arsenal (granted, it's pretty meager as those go). Nothing works. In some of the forums I saw that other people have similar issue with their Nexus, so it appears I am not alone with this particular grudge. It is still as dead as when I first unpacked it. Considering that I am a frequent Skype user, it is a very big deal for me. Hence two stars down.An update: After one of the latest automatic software upgrades (lost track of dessert course name changes by now - could be Jelly Bean, Jello Cake or Red Bean Bun,)my camera suddenly came to life. I am happy to report that now I can Skype! And, according to my parents half way across the globe, the quality of the video was comparable to that of my laptop camera. So I've decided to add a star to the rating to reflect that development. Sorry, can't give all five - I hold grudges for a long time, and this little gizmo gave me few reasons.

tablet|It was easy to set up. It's the only product that is pure android! Only product that has a true 100% Google Chrome Web browser that works just like the desktop web browser. The tablet is fast and has great resolution and graphics card for watching videos and this device is actually a pretty good gaming system with no lag and good controls with just touch screen only and great graphics. For just one sound speaker bar it has good sound quality. I did Google + Hangout with my Dad which he has a Nexus 7 and the video was pretty crisp with very little lag and good sound quality. All you Google apps work great with the tablet. This is the lowest priced tablet with a Quad Core Nvidia CPU! So the pure Android experience(no OEM manufacturer spin off on the Android OS) and a great CPU is what attracted me to buy the tablet. Also the system OS update to the current 4.x.x.x upgrade took only 15 minutes max where as upgrading my I Phone 4 to the latest IOS 6 took over 4 hours. Battery life is pretty good. Great selection of games and even good free games to download and play. Its light weight and thin which is a plus. I like it is user friendly to adjust settings to you liking. I like the desktop interface on this device and that you can put apps on your home screens or on the bottom bar and even have many app shortcuts in one box which expands when you click the box. Great product ASUS and Google.

tablet|first let me tell you google and nexus are not playing with this tablet, they did a really good job with this tablet.its really thin, the build quality is really goodi looked all over for this tablet and they were sold out, so i took my chances at a local gamestop and to my luck they had one left. i told the manager about the price drop on the 30th of october and she told me i would get the difference if i brought in the reciept.When you turn on the tablet it asks to connect to a wifi network, after you connect it to a network and do the usual android set-up. you will notice it isn't loaded with any bloatware apps, only google ones.the app trasistions are really fluent, no lagi even installed a ram hog downloader app and the tablet didnt slow down one bit,i was amazed at how well the quad core handles. the tegra 3 chips really helps to maintan a really long play time on a single charge. the screen is really crip, i am just blown by this tablet.if you are debating between this one and the galaxy tab 2 7.0. Get this tablet you will not regret it. best tablet so far

tablet|Ok, I for one never thought I would own a tablet. After buying my daughter a Kindle Fire(which is nice btw) and playing a little with hers I thought I would dabble in the tablet market. I am more techie than most and did not want something I cant fit in my back pocket, and also wanted something that would always have the latest android os/google offering. This tablet is just that. For one its extremely fast, after getting the jelly bean update 4.1.2 the lag has been removed. It screams and wants to do more! Google voice is somewhat like Apples Siri, obviously its not quite ready to beat siri but its getting there. The battery lasts from 6am until 11:30 when im going to bed. I actually use it most of the day and have become enthusiastic about reading books again. The Fire is perfect for kids, and non technical people and this could also but leaves room for us techie folks. I only expect this to get better as google sells more and more add-ons come on the market. The one big thing and I have seen this alot on online is the screen, DO NOT DROP ON A HARD FLOOR!! once the glass breaks its inoperable. and right now no replacement screens on the market! buy a cover/case and be careful. Hope this helps anyone decided between the two. And yes it fits in your back pocket of jeans. (if your a guy).

tablet|I own a Galaxy Nexus and an aging HP tm2t tablet PC, but I found that each touch device didn't really hit the sweet spot for reading articles with apps like Pocket. The GNex's screen is too small to read comfortably while the tablet PC is too bulky to use for reading on the couch. I wanted a device that I'd be able to use for one-handed reading without having to squint at the text, and the Nexus 7 has performed beautifully for that. Pocket is pretty much flawless on this thing and there are a variety of comic book reader apps you can install to read all of the sketchy .cbr files you have obtained through perfectly legal means.It's also an unexpectedly great gaming device. Aside from the classics like Angry Birds and Cut the Rope, I also have built up a library of Android games from past Humble Bundles. Games like World of Goo and Spirits are fantastic on this tablet. I don't do a lot of 3d gaming to flex the Tegra 3 GPU, mostly because I don't like the way such games control on a touchscreen, but I have played Horn, an Infinity Blade-type game which looks outstanding on this device. I think the 7-inch form factor is great for showing detail without weighing you down. Android also has a huge variety of emulator options and I am playing through Kirby and SMB3 on SNESoid, which is fantastic.My parents have iPads and I've played with them quite a bit but have always been bored with their restricted home screen and carefully walled-in app store. And as a heavy GMail, Google Maps and Google Calendar user, Android was just a better choice. Everything syncs effortlessly between my phone, my PC with Chrome and the tablet. The Play store is a pretty mature market at this point and many phone apps run well on a 7-inch screen, but some categories of tablet apps are still lacking. I have yet to find a perfect Twitter client, for example. That's a problem with the ecosystem rather than this specific device though.The hardware is pretty great. I'd take off a half star because after a couple months of use there seems to be some flex where the front glass meets the soft-touch backing. That worries me durability-wise. But overall it is supremely balanced and weighted for comfortable use around the house. There are some display bugs which may have been fixed with the most recent update, including subtle backlight flickering in some conditions and a washed-out display that occurs after exiting a video. Not sure if these are still issues.I bought the higher-capacity version because of the quantity of comics and games I have put on this thing. If those aren't concerns for you, you can easily get along with only 8 GB, especially if you stream songs from Google Music, which negates the annoying chore of USB sync, another reason I have never liked Apple devices.Overall, if you have been eyeing this device as an instinct buy because of its low price and high specs, it will live up to your expectations. Because it is inexpensive, I was able to justify a purchase of what would otherwise have been a silly extra device. Google and Asus strategically cut out less useful features like 3G, back-facing camera and vibration in order to have high-quality essentials such as processor, screen and build quality, which I think was a brilliant design decision.

tablet|When buying a tablet, you are buying the warranty/customer service/tablet as part of a whole package. For this reason, my review includes my warranty/customer service experience.This is a review for a 16 GB tablet ordered directly from Google. The first tablet was defective out of the box. Getting an RMA from Google took over a month. My e-mail requests were auto replied to, stating a service rep. would contact me in 2 days. Two weeks later I still had no RMA, replacement tablet, or reply contact from customer service. I called Google and after an hour of waiting on hold, I was told that it was taking time to replace bad tablet batches and I would receive a new working non-defective tablet in about a week.After two weeks I received a replacement tablet which was also defective. I had the exact same problems trying to get an RMA. Instead of exchanging it, I requested a refund. Google's policy says that refunds are given in about two weeks. It has been over a month and I still have no refund. While I understand that bad batches do happen, there is no excuse for poor customer service.The tablet itself looks nice and has a nice feel to it. It is just the right size for reading. The weight is great for reading in bed. I like the Android Jelly Bean experience on my cell phone, but was not able to experience the OS on the tablet due to the defects. Search for Nexus 7 16 GB problems and you can read similar experiences from other users.Amazingly, there have been few problems reported with the 8 GB version. I hope this helps you decide and as always, BUYER BEWARE.

tablet|I bought the Nexus 7 over the kindle fire...and am now definitely regretting it. I have had it in a leather case since I bought it and it has never been dropped-but after a month of having it the screen cracked....even though it has NEVER been dropped. After it cracked (and that corner stopped working) I looked up other reviews and saw that many people have had similar problems. I called google and they said that likely that will not be covered under the warrenty, but that i can send it in, however if i send it in and it's not working-I have to pay for a whole new one! So instead, I am left with a giant paper weight. I would not reccomend this product as there was no reason for the screen to have cracked already and google was not helpful in repairing it.

tablet|My wife has a Kindle Fire HD and loves it. I found it too heavy and bulky; I couldn't hold it in one hand, which killed it for me as an e-reader. I didn't like all the advertising ("customers who bought this also liked ...") and the "walled garden" Amazon-centric operating system. The Fire HD is basically an Amazon content player, which is something different than a multi-purpose tablet.I ended up getting a Nexus 7. I like it a LOT. It is thinner and lighter than a Fire HD, more akin to a Kindle Keyboard (same basic dimensions, couple of ounces heavier). It can easily be held in one hand as an e-reader. The screen resolution and quality appear to be the same as the Fire HD.Where the Nexus really shines is fivefold:- processor: It is way faster than the somewhat sluggish Fire HD and closer to the experience of using a snappy desktop computer (although not quite fully there)- Android 4, which is a much more advanced and up to date version of Android than the Android 2 software on the FireHD. It's smooth, fast, and easy to navigate and customize. Future updates/improvements to Android will be automatically installed on the Nexus, while Amazon's customized interface may or may not ever get an update as newer models appear. That is not a trivial difference.- For anyone already plugged into the Google ecosystem (gmail, Google Drive, cloud print, picassa, google docs, calendar, contacts, etc) the integration is phenomenal on the Nexus. Browser elements (bookmarks, tabs, etc) stay in sync across all devices. Photo albums and videos stored in Picassa and Google Drive show up in a tidy directory on the Nexus automatically. Your entire music library can be stored in Google Play for streaming and/or local playback on the Nexus and all your other devices. Google Cloud Print will print a document from the Nexus to your printer ... from anywhere on Earth. Paired with a $15 app to open and edit Microsoft Word/Excel/Powerpoint/PDF documents, the cloud print feature converts what would otherwise be an entertainment device into a fairly useful productivity/work enhancer. Basically, Google has been working on a lot of different stuff in the mobile space, and it all sort of comes together in the Nexus 7.- the app store (Google Play), which is not available to FireHD users, is fairly complete and has thousands of interesting, useful and cool apps. People whine and moan about how it's so inferior to the Apple store, but I've had lots of Apple products and the app stores seem roughly comparable. Yelp, Flixter, Netflix, Accuweather, Evernote, Dropbox, news readers, games, shopping apps - it's all there. It's not "curated" like the Apple store, so it has a bit more of a rustic, wild-west feel as small developers put up their stuff, some of which isn't ready for prime time. But people review the apps like mad, so there's tons of feedback and guidance from other users, which frankly is more useful than some middle manager deciding what can or can't go in the store. Some of the apps have thousands of user reviews. I've had no problem at all finding the good stuff and avoiding the junk. It's actually more comparable to the Amazon buying experience, where you look for products with a lot of good reviews and proceed accordingly.- The FREE google navigation software that comes loaded on the machine is the best sat nav software I've used, period. I use it, and it alone, for all of my sat nav needs now. I'm telling you, this app is a MUST HAVE.The Kindle for Android app works perfectly and is just as good as reading books on the Fire. Popular apps like Dropbox and Evernote work flawlessly in Android, just like they do on Apple (though in some cases with fewer features, as the developers are only now getting on board with the "Android is here to stay" concept).Google has packed the Nexus with cool Google apps like Google Earth, Maps, and so on, plus a lot of great integration and clever use of Google technologies. For instance, there's a voice-Google search. I hit the button and asked, "How late is the Dunkin Donuts in Herndon Virginia open?" and it brought up the store hours. I said "Map of London" and up it came, a big Google map filling the screen. Pretty cool. Numerous Android apps and widgets now use the voice-search feature. For instance, I bought Dictionary for a couple of bucks. Hit the mic button, speak the word I want, and up comes the spelling, full dictionary definition, and thesaurus entries. Another example: voice-based searching through Wikipedia - outstanding!!!! There's a browser called Dolphin (it's free) which enables voice-based web surfing and practically eliminates typing for basic web search/navigation/reading. Man, what a timesaver and convenience. Makes me wonder how I ever got by hunting-and-pecking on stupid tablet keyboards, when I can just turn the device on and say "Chinese restaurants in Bethesda" or "Battle of Britain" and get immediate results.Downsides:- Unfortunately the Nexus does not stream Amazon videos. That is a negative for Prime members. Hopefully that will change in the future.- There is a bit of app freezing on the Nexus and a tendency for it to get, for lack of a better word, "clogged". After you've been using it for a while (a few days) apps gets sluggish and you start noticing delays. Doing a full reboot (turning the device off, then turning it back on a few minutes later) gets things re-started and snappy again. I don't know whether this is Nexus-specific or a characteristic of tablets in general, with their limited RAM (1 gig on the Nexus) and consequent memory swap madness.- Coming over from an Apple platform, the apps obviously won't work in Android, so there's an investment to be made. A lot of good stuff is free, but some of the good apps and work-related apps do cost money. So there's some duplication involved. I probably spent $100 or so re-buying stuff I already had on my Apple devices.- there've been complaints about build quality, although I think that was in the earlier days. My unit is rock-solid and built like a tank - couldn't be happier.Frankly, it's one of the most fun and useful devices I've purchased. Big thumbs up for the Nexus 7. They've really packed a lot of value into this relatively low-priced gadget. The Sat Nav and voice search alone is worth the cost of admission, in my opinion, and that barely even scratches the surface. I have over a hundred apps on this thing.UPDATE # 1: Ifr you buy a Nexus and are into news reading, pick up an app called News USA. It's free. It provides complete versions of a hundred or so newspapers and magazines, like the New York Times, Washington Post, Atlantic Magazine, People, Sports Illustrated, Time, etc. I hate to be a contributor to the downfall of an industry, but we're going to be letting some of our newspaper and magazine subscriptions expire, because all the content is here for free and it's just as easy to read at the breakfast table on the Nexus as it is a newspaper. The money saved on one newspaper subscription alone (I won't name names) pays for the whole Nexus device.2-MONTH UPDATE, 12/30/12: After writing the above review, my wife actually traded in her Kindle Fire HD for a Nexus 7, and loves it. Also, more recently, we both traded in our iPhones for Galaxy III's, so that we could use the same platform (Android) for tablets and phones. We're now 100 % Android. I continue to really like the Nexus 7, and find myself using it (and the phone) for a vast plethora of tasks and surfing that used to occur on my laptop or desktop computer. I really like how the Nexus 7 fits into a coat pocket so I can read on the go. I'm reiterating my 5 star rating.

tablet|I wrote this review for the 32 GB version. Most of that applies to this one as well.Full Disclosure:-----------------Let me state upfront that in the last 3 years, my wife and I have purchased 4 iPhones, 4 iPads, 1 Mac Mini, 1 Apple TV and 2 Macbook Airs for ourselves and extended members of the family. I cannot review this product without comparing it to the iPad 2, which I've been using for the last year and a half.Motivation:------------We have an 18 month old son who needs to be entertained with videos and apps while he's being fed and we have an upcoming trip to India during which we'll need to keep him busy during the flight and transits. Here are our requirements -1) We needed a tablet that is more portable than the 16 GB iPad 2 that we currently have so that it's easy to stuff into my cargo pants or jacket and pull it out quickly when required.2) We needed more than the 16GB storage to store his favorite videos because we may have intermittent access to WiFi, at least 32 GB.3) When he's not using it, I would like a tablet that's easy to grip for long hours of reading.Choice:--------Based on these 3 requirements, I restricted my choice to the iPad Mini, Kindle Fire HD and Nexus 7 32GB.Here are the reasons I decided to go with the Nexus 7.The 32 GB iPad Mini was almost $195 ((429 - 249) * 1.0825) more than the other 2 when you include CA state taxes. It is at least half an inch wider than the Nexus 7 which makes it slightly harder to grip if you have small hands like me. The areas where it's better - slightly bigger screen, iOS app store, rear camera were not that important to me since we already have an iPad 2 and I don't take photos with tablets.I chose Nexus 7 over Kindle Fire because I use a lot of Google services and wanted a tablet with a more open ecosystem. I can read Kindle e-books and listen to music using the Amazon Cloud Player on the Nexus 7. We have a Netflix subscription so the loss of Amazon Instant Video was not that important.Review:---------Here are the things that I liked about the Nexus 7 -1) Jelly Bean (4.1) is really good. I had played with Android phones and tablets before and they used to lack the smoothness of iOS. I think it's pretty close now.2) The higher resolution HD screen is great for reading and watching videos.3) If you are heavily into the Google ecosystem, it's a breeze to set it up.4) Android in general is more customizable with widgets etc.5) I was able to download most of the iOS apps that I use frequently with some exceptions. More on that later.6) I liked the auto-update feature on Android. It's an option that you can tick while downloading an app. It automatically downloads updates to that app.7) I liked the notification system and realized why iOS decided to replicate it.8) I also liked the shortcut for looking at running apps and a simple flick deletes them.9) It is easier for my son to hold compared to the iPad 2. He also has a habit of pressing the home button and exiting the app on the iPad 2 and then complaining about it (he's only 18 months old) but fortunately he can't do that on the Nexus 7.Here are the things that I thought were missing -1) There are fewer tablet optimized apps on Android. The quality of apps on iOS for iPad is definitely better. Flipboard was good on Nexus 7 but Zite lacked the polish of the iPad app. NYTimes was good. The usual games like Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja and Cut the Rope were more unstable and crashed a few times. I installed Talkatone to make calls through Google Voice and it worked fine. The usual ones - Netflix, Skype, etc. worked fine. I noticed some lag while using Zinio to read the National Geographic.2) I'm still not used to the Chrome browser on a tablet. It seemed to me that accessing bookmarks on the iOS browser is easier. I found all my bookmarks already synced on my Chrome browser but accessing them requires multiple steps.3) It is slightly heavier than the iPad Mini but not by a lot. The iPad Mini is still ahead in terms of external design and looks but the cost mattered more to me this time. I may have paid $100 more for the iPad Mini because of the iOS app ecosystem advantage but $195 was a very high premium for an optional device.Conclusion:-------------The Nexus 7 is an excellent device irrespective of the price but the price makes it easier to appreciate it even more. If your requirements and expectations are similar to mine, I would strongly recommend it. I bought this product from Office Depot but I felt that the review might help others make a decision.

tablet|I was totally against tablets... then i started college. I needed a small note taker and this is the best investment i ever made. It works great with games. It can play ANY android game without lag including Dead Trigger. I ordered this tablet and never looked back. GET THIS TABLET.

tablet|The only reason I am not rating this a 5 is lack of an SD slotI purchased this for my husband who is obsessed with Angry Birds - to the point I have to wrestle my phone from him to make a call. (his employer does not provide employees with smart phones which is why he uses mine). I didn't want to get a POS on sale at the drug store for $99 - I figured he may actually want to do something else with it someday, so after much research - this was my choice.This is going to be a birthday present and I wanted to surprise him with something that he could open and immediately enjoy. I downloaded all the games he could possible want to play, sync'd all his music, appx 110 cd's (fyi - this does NOT support WMA - you will have to convert your music library if that is how you have it stored), I also downloaded ALL the photos from our computer (10 years marriage, 14 vacations + misc) and have used 14.7 gigs of the 16. There is no room left.Separate note - Adobe doesn't support Android 4.0 or later so if you are a fan of Fragger, you are out of luck. (there are work arounds, google it).For a light to medium user, someone who wants a decent first tablet or someone upgrading from an e-reader - I recommend.

tablet|I've had my 16gb Google Nexus 7 tablet for over a month now. I read reviews and info on tons of difdferent tablets and I'm not a apple person, I refuse to buy apple products and besides the ipads the nexus 7 had one of the highest ratings and after reading the tech specs I was convinced it was the tablet for me! I can't stand when people give this product a low rating because it has no slot for a micro sd card and/or no rear camera! Obviously if you read about this tablet you know that before purchasing so if that's a deal breaker for you, don't buy it! I wasn't concerned about having 16gb of storage, my smartphone has 16gb stroage and I have tons of musc, pics and apps and I still have almost 6gb free. I also have an excellent 8mp digital camera and an 8mp camera on my phone that work great! This tablet is very eay to use, as soon as I got it home fully charged it and powered it up it connected to our home wi-fi network right away. The tablet itself is very well made, great quality. The screen is amazing, the back of the tablet has great grip to it and man this thing is blazing fast. I've got a all in one desktop pc with an intel core i5 processor and 8gb memory and a sony vaio laptop with an intel core i3 processor and 4 gb memory. My tablet blows my laptop out of the water as far as speed and is just as fast, if not a little faster then my expensive desktop that costs over $1000. Also I've never had any performance problems with this tablet, like I do with both of my pc's. My laptop freezes up a lot and my desktop freezes up but not as much as my laptop. My tablet never freezes, the internet on it is great and also it downloads songs and apps so quickly! Ever since I've had my google nexus 7, I hardly ever use my computers! Also playing games on my tablet is awesome! As far as storage use, I've got music, apps, games and pictures on my tablet and I've still got about 12gb of free space! If you are concerned about storage but want a great tablet for a great price, download dropbox and you can get an account to store all your photos and media! The speakers on it are great, music sounds awesome! I recommend buying a screen protector so that you do not get fingerprints covering your screen! I love my google nexus 7 and I'm so glad I decided to purchase it! I honestly think it is the best tablet on the market for the money and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a 7" tablet, you CANNOT go wrong with the 16gb google nexus 7!!!!

tablet|Had the Nexus 7, 16 GB for less than a month. It has been in a Supcase cover since day 1. Opened the cover after 2 days of no use and the screen is frozen and cracks noted on the screen. Called Google Play and they stated they are getting calls about cracked and lifted screens. They were very helpful until they learned I did not buy it through them, then they referred me to Asus. Asus states they will be more than happy to fix the defective screen for $160 plus shipping. Apparently, according to Asus, I am the FIRST consumer to call them with a cracked defective screen that was not from a dropped tablet. Check the internet----there are tons of reports out there of screen issues with Nexus 7. Too bad, because the tablet operating system is awesome. I am not a kid, I am an older female and I treated this tablet very gently. I will not get it repaired because I did nothing to cause it to break therefore it is likely to break again. I am very disappointed.
---
tablet|Note - at $249 with shipping and taxes, the 16GB Nexus 7 actually costs roughly $282 from Google. This makes the marked-up prices on Amazon look a lot more innocent. I strongly recommend you get the 16GB version, because the 8GB version leaves you with just over 5GB of usable storage.I've used MANY other 7" tablets on the market. I've used tablets as cheap as Coby tablets Coby Kyros 7-Inch Android 4.0 4 GB 16:9 Capacitive Multi-Touchscreen Widescreen Internet Tablet with Built-In Camera, Black MID7042-4 and Idolian tablets Idolian TURBOTAB C8 (TM)- 7 inch, 1.5GHZ CPU, 5 Point Capacitive Touch Screen Tablet PC-Android 4.0, 512MB DDR3, 4GB with Google Market. I've used tablets from bigger names, including the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 Plus Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus 16GB (Dual Core, Universal Remote, WiFi) and the Acer Iconia A100 Acer Iconia TAB A100-07U08U 7-Inch Tablet (8GB). Of course I have also used the competing red-hot Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet.The Nexus 7 fits right in-between these budget tablets and high-end tablets in terms of price, but in terms of performance, it soars above all of them. As of August 2012, this is the best 7-inch tablet on the market of all of the ones I've used. It's way faster than any of the aforementioned tablets, it's more aesthetically pleasing, it has the best display of all of them, and it has by far the best internal specs. The first of its kind to be running Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean, an OS that prioritizes user input to yield smoother animations, transitions, scrolling, and an overall "buttery" interface, it also comes with a very capable quad-core processor. You can really feel that the tablet is just quicker than most Android tablets out there, even in doing something as simple as pinching to zoom. It's very hard to go back to one of the older tablets once you've experienced the buttery feeling of Jelly Bean on the Nexus 7. As a point of reference to iOS users out there like me, this is, in my opinion, the first 7-inch tablet to feel as responsive as an iPad, something few tablets rival when it comes to user interface performance. No more hitching and juddering when switching home screens or scrolling through apps, no more laggy zooming and scrolling.The device is very comfortable for me to hold in one hand, and I enjoy reading books on it more than I do on my iPad 3, even with its Retina display. The text is still incredibly crisp on the Nexus 7, even though it's not quite Retina quality, and the white color of the pages is very neutral and easy on the eyes. It doesn't skimp on the beautiful page-turning animations, either! The weight is identical to a paperback book of similar dimensions, and the back makes for a good grip. It also, unlike so many other tablets, shows no fingerprints on the back. The Gorilla glass on the front of the device has not scratched even remotely, even with keys and coins in my cargo pocket. The tablet feels rugged, yet not overly heavy.The one thing I miss from other tablets when using this one is the microSD expansion slots that so many Android tablets have. MicroSD was my preferred method of side-loading content and applications onto my devices because it saved me a USB port. However, this isn't a huge issue, as the Android file manager for Windows and Mac is actually very user-friendly and straight-forward to use. 16GB is enough for me (actual available storage is about 13.4 GB), as I use Google Play Music in the cloud for the vast majority of my listening, stream movies from my laptop using doubleTwist, and mostly read ebooks and surf the web. However, these are only my needs, and they worked out for me. If you are a media content packrat who needs to have all of their media on the go, this tablet is DEFINITELY not for you. If you can consolidate and bring only the stuff you know you need, this is perfect.Do note that this device has no rear-facing camera, and that the front-facing camera cannot take still shots.Google Now is fantastic. I hope this comes to more devices soon, because I would argue that it outdoes Siri in many, many ways.Battery life is a comfortable 8 hours doing a lot of different tasks with WiFi enabled and near-maximum brightness.My only complaint about the device is that when using headphones, a very, very faint buzzing can sometimes be heard when manipulating the screen. Turning off screen sounds in settings made it better, but sometimes it comes back.For the price, you can't go wrong with this tablet. This is, while affordable, in no means a budget tablet like the Coby Kyros or IdolPads. Those tablets have lower-quality displays, bulky designs, and often don't support many applications. Some of them have stretched, distorted pixels, and others aren't as responsive to touch. With the Nexus 7, you don't have to worry about any of that. The out-of-box experience is comparable to that of an Apple product, in which the darn thing "just works". Kudos, Google. You've made something, for the price, that makes Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Apple all watch their backs.

tablet|I have had the 16 GB version since release date and it is true what everyone says that this is the best tablet you can get for $200/$250 depending on the storage size. Good display of 1920 x 800, tegra 3, long battery life, front facing camera, corning glass, GPS, you even get a free $25 for use in google play. Now, everybody should know by now all these features as to how it trumps the kindle fire but I just wanted to point out the experiences that I did not like:1. my tablet had the "screen separation" issue that a lot of people experienced which means that the left side is creaking when pressed. Apparently, the screw inside was not tight. Google was quick though to ship a replacement while I hold on to my tablet until I actually receive the new one.2. I hate it that when a new Android version comes along that the app developers are slow to make it compatible. With Android 4.1, you will not be able to install HBO Go, TWC TV, Viber, not even Amazon shopping app. HBO took months before they released an app compatible with ICS, so do I have to wait months again before I can watch on jellybean??? I think this is where Apple really shines as compatability is rarely an issue, anyway. I would not have mind if they shipped this with ICS first with option to upgrade.3. I hope for more apps that fully utilize the Tegra 3 processor.4. SD card slot would have made it more perfect, but kindle does not have it as well.But for the price and the open Android experience, and the reliable Asus brand, you cannot go wrong with this one. Very fast, above average display, great battery.

tablet|I love android, I love the fact that I am able to customize my tablet, and do a whole lot of other cool features. The size was perfect for one hand. But too bad, my first N7, came with a dent on the side of the screen, which is hardly notice unless pinned to the light. Luckily I purchased from GameStop and was able to go in and exchange it for a second N7. It was great until last night, where I had left it to charge so I can bring it to school the next morning to work on a project to realize that it did not charge at all. So I came home and try to troubleshoot the problem but it looks like the port was defected and started to malfunction after seven days. So I went back to GameStop and got me a 3rd exchange, and when I got home I googled all the defects that is being encountered wit the N7 and found lots of problems, so I didn't want to take a gamble with the third one and exchanged it for my money back.It was too bad, I really had a great time with the tablet...well at least I'll be ready to buy one once all defects are taken care of.

tablet|The Nexus has great promise and will be a good machine when Google works out the kinks in a couple of months. The screen is beautiful when it works.The on screen keypad is easy to use for email, etc. The processor plows through multiple apps.But the units have a high failure rate. There are many reports of problems and I have experienced problems with Google's poor support and unit manufacturing problems. Consider my experience.I am on my THIRD UNIT and Google has not yet refunded the $250 dollars I had to give them to get the first unit replaced over a month ago. The touch screen on my first unit died and Google required a $250 deposit to get a replacement. They did not tell me was that it was policy to wait at least 15 business days after they got the first unit before they refunded the $250. Before I got the refund for the replacement it DIED completely. Even though they still have the $250 deposit for the first unit, Google will not send me a replacement unless I give them another $250. That that means that Google will have over $750 of my money before I got a single working unit.Google support staff can do nothing to help other than ask you to do a hard reboot by holding down the power, up volume and down volume buttons together for one minute.I tried to get a refund but Google will not give me one. They INSIST that I take a THIRD unit. With Google's manufacturing problems, what are the odds the third one will work?After I get a third one Google says it will give me refund as long as I ask within 15 days of getting it.Google's support staff and their managers are uncompromising.Google's support staff are obviously overwhelmed and Google is struggling to get people to make people keep these units.Remember, if you have ANY problems with your Nexus return it within 15 days. That's the only way you can get a refund. If you wait sixteen days, Google will only give you a replacement. No matter how screwed up it is.I thought only Microsoft's support was this bad.

tablet|This is the second unit I bought. The first one wouldn't turn on (or turn off some people may call it that way) at all. The Google logo wouldn't go away and I never ever saw a start screen on that unit! I'm an advanced technical user so followed all tips I found on Google for 4-5 hours I finally decided to call customer service. I decided to talk to google given its reputation, the rep was nice and told me the unit was missing Operating System, and to send it back to the shop!I was foolish enough to buy a second unit since my SO convinced me the first lemon was bad luck. 1.5 months later, after total of a couple of hours using it, it's dead - won't charge! I'm 100% it's not the charging cable since I tested the cable. It looks like I'll have to use the warranty. This is where the nighmare continued. First of all just to find a 1-800 number is a pain on the butt. Good luck go through the maze and MANY broken links on ASUS Web site! After I managed to find a phone number to call, the phone service is fairly restrictive, lots of fine prints about operating hours and the pre-requirement that customers must create a case prior calling them. In order to create a ticket, you must enter S/N, product type, Model. But there's no "tablet" category under "product type", and nothing else looks remotely close to what Nexus belongs. OK if I wait until weekdays during the day time I might get lucky and can talk to a live person. But, are you kidding me? It's misson impossible to live through the whole process!I don't like wasting time on Internet thus I feel strongly about writing this review to let others know what you may run into! What a piece of crap, and absolutely worst experience ever with a tablet! In my small family I owe iPad 1, iPad 2, one iPhone, 2 blackberries, never had anything like this before. I loved the idea of being able to use Android but this is not a quality product ready to go to the market.I wish there is a way to give it 0 star!

tablet|Up until this past week, I owned a Kindle Fire HD (which I got refunded because of a hardware hiccup). I bought a Nexus 7 instead and, while I liked my Fire, I prefer the Nexus 7 in ALMOST every way. Below are some comparisons I've made between the two devices. Which one you end up with largely depends on what you want the device for, but here are some considerations.Android versus Kind-of-Android: As my Fire review attests, I took to Amazon's heavily 'skinned' Android more than I thought I would. But with the Nexus 7, you get Android Ice Cream Sandwich in all of its fullness. The Kindle Fire is the easier to navigate device, as the homescreen is basically a carousel of recent items and a list of categories (apps, books, games, movies, web) that you can select. But the Nexus 7's Android is fully customizable with the traditional five home screens you can use to place apps, widgets, bookmarks, and the like. Full Android takes some learning (ICS is more intuitive than prior releases, though), but if you want customization, Nexus beats Fire. I should also mention the internet browsers. With the Kindles, you get Amazon Silk, a fairly slow browser (yes, it markets as fast, but it is slow by every measure) whose biggest selling point is text-rendering. With Nexus, the default browser is Chrome, but there are some other great tablet-optimized browswers like Puffin and Dolphin; while none of them have text-rendering like Silk, a few are flash-enabled, allow private browsing, and some other stuff that Silk does not allow.Reading, Listening, and Watching: I use my tablet largely as a media consumption device, and toward that end, Amazon is second to none. Those of us locked into Amazon's ecosystem of books, movies, and music will do well with the Fire and its integration into the Amazon universe. Buy a book or album, it shows up on your device (or your cloud). Have Prime? It is easy to stream Prime videos straight to your device. But here's the thing: you can do a lot of this (except for streaming video) on the Nexus, as Amazon's apps are freely available on the Play market. The two things you will (kind of) give up are the robustness of the kindle ebook reading experience (text-to-speech, for instance, is only available on kindle devices) and streaming Prime movies. Of course, I said &#34;kind-of&#34; give up because you CAN stream prime movies on the Nexus 7 via a few Flash enabled browsers that you can find by doing a web search. Oh, and as far as ereading apps, you are not locked into any one provider on the Nexus: Google Boooks, Nook, Sony Reader, Mantano Reader, Aldiko - it is all easily available on the Play market (where with the Fire, you have to go through a fairly tedious sideload process).Tablet Hardware: Okay, here, the Nexus 7 is the CLEAR winner. In honesty, the Fire and Fire HD just strike me as somewhat cheaply made (and the Fire is just bulky). The Nexus is not only an inexpensive tablet, but a really pretty and solid-feeling one as well. It is lighter than the Fire (by a lot) and HD (by a noticeable little). The screen is just better on the Nexus than the HD (even though the specs are roughly the same), and the Nexus is DEFINITELY faster than either the Fire or HD. The two areas where I think the Kindle does have the advantage hardware-wise are that the side bezels are thicker (more room for your thumb to grip the front of the device in portrait mode), and the speakers (Fire and HD have stereo speakers that are very good quality, while Nexus has one speaker that is light and tinny).What each has that the other doesn't: The Nexus is more of a serious tablet than the Fire. It has features like Google voice search (like Appple's Siri, but more polished), Google Now (sort of a personal planner), and GPS. None of these are available on the Kindle Fire.On the other hand, the Fire and HD are great media consumption devices: on the devices, you get text-to-speech for most kindle books, whyspersync (where you can buy the book and audio book combo and have the kindle sync them so that you can switch between the two), and streaming of Prime video (per above, a big awkward on the Nexus). While not particularly a feature of the Fire or HD, I should mention that Amazon has phenomenal customer service for these devices, while Nexus customer support is spotty.Really, it comes down to what you want. As you can see, both devices have features the other does not have, but for my money, I still prefer the Nexus on balance. It is a more solid tablet (remember, my Fire HD's hardware encountered problems, which isn't normal, but it isn't abnormal). And it is a tablet that, unlike the Fire and HD, do not seek to lock you into one content provider. If it is available on the Play market, I can get it. And the Nexus's Google Voice and Google Now features are surprisingly helpful.

tablet|I ordered my first nexus and it was great for a few weeks.. and then it wouldn't charge anymore. I returned it for another, and a few weeks later that one would turn on, and then turn off seconds later.. over and over. I eventually just gave up when troubleshooting didn't work. I bought a Samsung Galaxy and the Kindle Fire hd instead.

tablet|I'll try to cover the things that made an impact in my purchase and in my daily usage. A little background; I'm a advanced user, i own a Samsung Galaxy S3, Iphone 4, Windows PC, and a few other gadgets. I read a lot about the mobile industry, Android, Apple, Microsoft, etc. This is just to let you know guys, where i'm coming from. So here we go. -_-.Like a lot of you, i was undecided between the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and the Asus Google Nexus 7 (The Kindle Fire HD, wasn't in my options, it's because i live outside the US, so no amazon content for me. Also, i don't like the forked Amazon OS). The reason i choose this, was meanly for this aspects: Screen Resolution, Faster Processor and Graphics Card. One main disadvantage, as all of you may know by now, is the lack of SD-Card. But there are so many options, including attaching a flash drive using a OTG USB Cable. I know that it isn't the ideal solution, but if i found myself needing more space (and trust me, i will) it's nice to know i have options.OS:The first thing i did was root my device and put it a Custom ROM. Yes i know that one of the reason people buy Google "official" devices, it's to have the "pure android experience" as well regular and fast updates. But for me, i particularly don't like the direction Google it's taking with the OS on the nexus 7, it looks more like a BIG Phone, instead a Small Tablet. That's the reason i put a Custom ROM in it. I want to use my tablet as a tablet and my phone as a phone. I like to have the dual-pane, that categorizes the tablet market, so after a lot of youtube's videos, and homing around the XDA forums, i did just that.Design:It's light, beautiful packaged and nice rubber-ish texture on the back. It's portable, it can fit in a back pocket in your jeans, but if you are going to use it without a cover, i would recommend getting a screen protector at least. Even though, it has corning glass protection, it is best to prevent for any unwanted scratches.I use this also for work. it's a great companion to take notes, record meetings, and show presentations. Also, as a market researcher, in my company we use an android app to conduct our surveys.Miscs:For me, this is the best 7" tablet around. First, it's cheap. Secondly, top-of-the-line specs. Third, nice looking HD screen, watching movies or just surfing the web it's amazing. Also, playing games in this tablet it's great. I don't care if you are a hardcore gamer, or just some casual gamer that plays from time to time, it is awesome. There are so many reasons to buy this, for some the lack of a back camera may be a deal breaker, but for me, it wasn't. As i usually have my phone around, it doesn't affect me. Besides, you wouldn't look so sexy, holding your tablet in portrait mode to take a picture outside, while you are in the subway or in the street.Here are my two cents. i tried to make a compact and short review. There are so many things you can say about this device, for me it's the perfect size for all the things i just described above. If you are planning on getting one, go ahead, i'm pretty sure you won't regret it.I hope you like this review, i'll be coming with more updates to let you know other aspects of this tablet.Any comments or if you think i can help you with something, put it on the comments section, i'll reply as soon as possible.Update 11/05/2012:I just noticed the screen flickers a little bit when it's on a white page, most commonly on the browser (it's only noticeable if your brightness is set to low) and the WiFi it's getting data. I've search online and found out that is an issue with the WiFi position in the device. Nothing major though, as this only occurs if you have the brightness set to minimum and you are in a dark room. You just move the brightness to 30% - 40%, and it fix the issue.

tablet|I actually pre-ordered the Nexus 7 from the Google play store because I thought it was a great value. The tablet's OS is great, but the build quality is horrific because I received 3 straight defective ones DIRECTLY from Google. I went through the RMA process twice with their support team. The tablet's screen was raised on the left hand side causing the glass not to be entirely flush with the tablet's bezel. On top of receiving three defective tablet's from Google, it took their customer service department 35 days to give me a refund talk about ridiculous. The amount they with held from me was $285 which I could have put towards another tablet of my choosing, if they would given my refund in a timely manner. I know people hate big box stores like Best Buy or Office Depot but at least there you won't have to wait 35 days for a return.

tablet|Review of Nexus 7 16 GB bought in late August 2012.The good:1. Great screen size, big enough to see but easy to carry.2. Light and thin. Easy to hold. (Easier to hold with Supcase leather case.)3. Very good, intuitive user interface.4. Bright display colors and easy to read text. Works well with Kindle application.The bad:1. No rear facing camera. This makes it difficult or impossible to use some android applications, such as UPC code scanners.2. Extremely fragile screen. Nexus 7 does not use Gorilla glass, just "fortified glass" glued on top of the display screen. After having my Nexus for only 2-1/2 days, I placed my Nexus 7 in the front left pocket of my cargo shorts and sat down and the screen shattered, as if it was made of microscope slide cover glass. There were no other objects in my pocket, and my shorts were loose fitting so the Nexus was not in any kind of bind. The cover glass runs right to the edge of the Nexus 7, and the frame is really flimsy. There is no way an uncased Nexus 7 could survive any kind of drop. (In contrast my 9 year old son has dropped my Droid X, which does have Gorilla glass, numerous times with no damage, and I carry my Droid X in the same front pants pocket daily.)Even though the screen was clearly defective, Asus's warranty (Asus makes the Nexus 7) does not cover screen breakage for any reason. Their warranty service is also somewhat difficult to work with, and the cost to replace my screen and ship my Nexus back to me was $164, plus the $15 it cost me to ship it to Asus.About three weeks later I received my repaired Nexus 7. After fully charging the battery, I tried to turn my Nexus on. I had a very difficult time getting it to boot to the home screen. It took about seven times turning the unit off and back on before I could get the touch screen to register any input. For the next two days the touch screen had dead spots and only worked sporadically. Since then it seems to be working normally.I purchased a Supcase leather case for my Nexus, and I highly recommend this product. It fits the Nexus 7 very snuggly, and it looks like it would protect the unit against most bumps and drops. When you close the front cover of the case it puts the Nexus into sleep mode. The cover is held closed with magnets sewn into the leather. Now I feel a lot more comfortable carrying my Nexus around, since the Nexus housing is somewhat slippery and I was constantly worried about bumping or dropping my Nexus and breaking the cover glass again.Summary: The Nexus 7 is a great size, lightweight, and a lot of fun to use; but I only give it 3 stars because of its very fragile cover glass. (See update below.)Update 11/2/12: My Nexus operating system is performing better than ever after two software updates. I am not reading a lot of other reviews of the Nexus where the cover glass was as fragile as mine, so perhaps I got a bad unit, but I am still disappointed that Asus service did not warranty my defect. My wife also has a Nexus, and we have had no issues with her unit. I am now pleased enough with our Nexus 7 tablets that I am revising my rating upwards to four stars.

tablet|I've been sporting an iPad 1 for the last few years, it finally was deemed no longer supported by apple and rather then forking out another $500-$750 for a new one I opted to go the route of the Nexus 7. The reason? I switched from an iphone to android a while back and rather then buying apps in 2 locations figured it would make more sense to stick with one eco-system, even if apple is trying to kill it off.The tablet arrived after shipping quickly. Was delivered by UPS and left at my front door, something Apple would never allow which was great because I had to work that day and didn't have to take the day off to be home to sign for it. When I got home I opened it up, unboxed it and fired it up. The Nexus 7 had 50% battery charge out of the box and when I signed into it I received the $25 play store credit, it synced up my email and everything else and I was good to go.Initial impressions. This thing is the perfect size. I was a bit worried a 7" tablet would be too small but it turns out it feels great to hold in one hand, it's not heavy and the round corners make it feel lighter. The build quality of my Nexus 7 doesn't have the issues others report. I used it for several hours after getting it and the screen never stopped working once.I fired up the copy of transformers that came with the tablet and it started playing, the sound was loud and unexpected. I half thought it would be muffled and too quiet but that was not the case. One question I had was could I get movies from the play store and save them locally for offline watching, the answer is yes! Just hit the little pin button that pops up and it downloads the movie.The tablet overall is great, I won't review google now and everything else as far too many others have. Just search for those reviews. What I will say is everything is working perfectly. I haven't had any issues and this tablet is working great. I love it fits into my back pocket of my jeans, even my Dockers dress pants, sure it sticks up a bit but that's not a problem for me. It's portable and I like that.I would recommend getting one of these if you have a first gen ipad as it blows it out of the water. I can't comment on the 2nd or 3rd gen ipads but frankly it is a matter of preference. For me I like android and I like this tablet so it's a home run for me.

tablet|After reading extensive reviews of both the iPad, Samsung Galaxy 2, and the Nexus, I figured I would go with the N7. 4 days after buying it, I can't seem to put it down! I love everything about it, from the vast amount of free (as well as paid) applications available in the Play Store, to the rich, crisp responsive screen.The main reason why I chose the N7 to begin with was the Tegra Quad-Core processor-one of, if not THE best processor in tablets under $500-600 today. Plus flash capability, as well as the latest version of Android OS, 4.1 Jelly Bean. Everything loads super fast, apps download instantly with wifi, and games play flawlessly.One of the major selling points of the Galaxy 2 is the SD memory card slot. Although that is nice, the N7 can support an OTG cable that plugs directly into it, added with a $3 app in the store and you know can plug in a flash drive, or even a 500gb external hard drive if you desire.Even the minute details, such as a face-detection password for unlocking the device, voice-command serching, Netflix capability, Play Books as well as countless other features add to the overall satisfaction of my purchase. It does everything an Ipad does (except cost THREE TIMES as much), AND more. I've seen countless apps that cost anywhere from $1-$7 for FREE on my tablet as opposed to the app store on my iPhone. As well as the ability to use the Firefox Beta web browser to run flash-oriented websites and videos. On top of the ability to have unlimited external memory makes me wonder why people are even looking anywhere else for a tablet. If you are looking for a 7" tablet and need guidance, take one of these home and you will NOT be disappointed, guaranteed.

tablet|I bought the Nexus 7 16gb after weeks of research. After a week and a half of using it, I'm extremely happy with my purchase. Here's why:-This baby syncs beautifully with everything-Google. I've been using the Google Calendar app+widget so much. This alone increased my productivity tenfold.-Apps, apps, apps! The Play store has some of the coolest apps. Few of the apps I've been using are 'Tasks' which syncs well with Google Tasks, 'Splashtop' for remote desktop (super cool and useful), GrooVe IP Lite for free phonecalls over WiFi if you have a Google Voice number, 'Evernote' for quick note taking, and 'FPse' for solid Playstation 1 gaming (60fps in FF9 baby!).-Free $25 in Play Store. I recommend using it on Apps to make the most of your money. I have over 10 solid apps I use daily, and still have over $15 left in Play Store credit.-Super smooth and responsive. I bought the first Droid 2 years back. I was hesitant buying another Android product since I had soo many problems with that Droid. Force closes, laggyness, unstable, etc. But Android has VASTLY improved w/ Jellybean. It's safe to say the Nexus 7 is now as smooth and responsive as any Apple product.-Killer screen and hardware specs.With that said, the Nexus 7 does lack some features which may be found on other tablets:-MicroSD slot/more internal storage. I didn't realize how fast 16gb would fill up. I've only had the Nexus 7 for a week and a half, and only have 5gb left from downloading apps and a few games (no movies/videos yet). They could have at least made a 32gb+ version!-Full USB OTG/MHL Support. Sorry, there is no way to connect the Nexus 7 to your HDTV. And you cannot connect external USB drive through USB OTG w/out rooting it first.Sure, it's missing a back camera and has a 1.5MP front facing camera in the year 2012, and even though these are cons, I bought the Nexus 7 knowing that so it didn't influence my grading. Given the price tag of $250 for the 16gb ($265 w/ accidental protection plan - score!), and weighing up the pros and cons, I would have say this is one of the best purchases I've made this year. I highly recommend it for students and the mainstream audience (aka non-super high techie people).

tablet|The Nexus 7 is my introduction to tablets and to Android. While there appear to have been quality control problems with early production, this is not unusual (10% of iPads fail in the first 12 months of ownership), and I am sure that ASUS will work out the kinks in their manufacturing process.The integration of Android 4.1 with core Google services, such as Gmail, Calendar, Google Drive, Books, Music and Picasa make a Nexus a great choice for someone already in the Google ecosystem (just as an iPad is a good fit for someone already enmeshed in Apple's ecosystem). Frankly, whether a store has 700,000 apps or 600,000 doesn't really matter as long as the apps you need are there, and so far, I have found everything I need -- and far more, most for free.There have been several pleasant surprises: a great deal of Google content syncs automatically, and is available offline, the predictive soft keyboard works far better than I expected, and the app versions of many things, such as Google books and music are much better than their browser counterparts.The screen is vibrant, clear and sharp -- for color accuracy, I compared the Nexus with a Macbook Air,using a standard color bar reference image. Battery life is very good, especially in" airplane mode" which automatically disables Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Automatic Bluetooth syncing with external speakers is especially noteworthy.The 7" form factor is both pocketable and convenient to hold for reading books, and the dimpled soft-touch back is very pleasant to the hand.I am still not 100% sold on the tablet concept, but if you find an iPad too big and expensive, the Nexus is best in class at this time. In 6 months, when Amazon, Apple, and B&N have released new tablets, who knows?PS: Entire review while using a Nexus 7.

tablet|I've tried and reviewed several android tablets over the years on Amazon. Most of the tablets I have had a chance to use actually were adequate for the money, especially if you were looking primarily for a "toy" or something to play an occasional game of angry birds, check email, or do some casual web browsing.The Nexus 7 however is in a different league. It is perfectly capable of being a primary means of doing most day to day activities on the web, social media, email and entertainment. The quad core 1 ghz processor is lightening fast and multi-tasks smoothly. Graphics are very clean and smooth. Battery life is very good, especially if you keep wifi and location services turned off when not needed.I use it often as an E-reader when I want to read in lighting that isn't enough for my Sony reader. Most low end tablets that I have tried in the past were not sharp enough to use in this manner for any length of time without eye fatigue from the low res background and text, but I can read comfortably for hours on the nexus.I have used it on Netflix and downloaded movies with no problems at all. One of the more demanding apps I have run on it is an RC helicopter simulator, and it ran just as smoothly as it does on my PC. I'm not a big gamer, so I have not tried it on any heavy duty games, but I feel confident it would perform well.There are a few things to be aware of with this tablet though.The unit has no external storage directly...in other words no SD or Micro SD slot. That being the case for the extra $50 I would go with the 16GB unit and not the 8 unless you do not care to store much on your tablet. The 8 GB unit will only give you around 6GB of free storage. There is now a program available for about $3.00 however that will allow you to use a usb stick as external storage and to play back media without having to put it on the tablet. The program, called Nexus Media Importer does not require you to root your tablet. You also have to have a cable for this but these are available for $1 - $5 on Amazon.com. Be careful here though as many of the cheapie ones ship from overseas, and quality could be questionable as well. I would spend the extra four bucks and get a domestically shipped one from a known manufacturer. It is a micro-usb to female usb adapter.One other minor annoyance is that for some reason, ASUS / Google chose to lock certain functions of the tablet in Portrait mode. This also is easily fixed with an external program available for a very reasonable cost called "Rotate". Once run and configured the tablet will automatically switch from portrait to landscape mode when you turn it over. I think this program is also around two or three dollars on google play. Keep in mind that currently you get a $25 credit for downloads with the purchase of the tablet, so you have no out of pocket expense for the software.Apparently there were some quality control issues on the early runs of the tablet. Several problems were possible. There was a problem with the screen not being mounted properly and appearing to be too high on one side or the other. There was also a problem with the screen losing touch sensitivity on one side after extended or demanding use like a game that used the quad core processor heavily.There was also an issue with the screws inside the tablet not being tightened properly causing a creak or other noise when the tablet was handled. There is a fix for this on the internet but you need to be aware that it could void your warranty if you accidentally leave any signs that the tablet has been opened. Search Youtube for detailed videos on how to do this procedure. There also have been reported issues with the built in microphone and / or speakers not functioning properly.I personally had to return the first 16 GB that I purchased to Walmart for a refund as it was the last one they had at the time I bought it. It had the screen sensitivity problem mentioned above. I then went to the local Office Depot, which had several 8 and 16 GB models in stock. I explained the potential problems to the sales person and asked if I could try the unit before I purchased it to avoid a potential return, and she agreed. The first one she brought out was an 8 GB, Serial number beginning with C60...the video display on it was totally defective...it appeared very washed out. She then brought me another one, a 16GB model, serial number beginning with C70, (the same serial series btw, as the one I had already returned to Walmart).This one appeared to work perfectly with no physical defects showing. Once I got it home and had used it a couple of days I noticed a little noise when I put pressure on certain areas so I removed the back and tightened all the screws around the edge of the frame slightly. Again, do this at your own risk, and be sure not to over-tighten them...just snug them up...these are tiny screws and can probably be stripped very easily. There are several detailed videos on exactly how to remove the back cover available on Youtube...by all means watch one before attempting it yourself.I believe that the manufacturer has been made aware of these problems and probably taken steps to correct them in more recently manufactured units. If I had the option I would avoid C60 serial number units unless you are absolutely certain you can return the unit if it proves to be defective. I would advise buying one locally if at all possible in preference to ordering it as it will probably be much easier to get it replaced if necessary.Overall, once I found a good one and downloaded the software mentioned above, I am absolutely thrilled with the tablet. I think it was worth the effort I put into it.

tablet|Had problems with 3 new Nexus 7 16GB tablets. The first one I purchased from Google.... it had 4 bright spots (like small flash lights on the left side of the screen)....and when the text to voice feature was activated it took over the unit and it stopped responding. (it is probably still talking in the box) It took Google 4 weeks to send the RA.... Unit #2 purchased from Office Depot (great group of people) it had trouble with the touch screen.... had to push hard for any response... Unit #3... worked real good for about 4 hours and it went dark.... would not restart or respond to the charger... so I figured they are having QA problems... I gave up and placed an order for the Kindle Fire HD 32GB.... expect to get in at the end of Oct...The Nexus 7 is a slick unit, when working. Unit #3 was fast, took voice commands with clear response... good touch screen and display... to bad it stopped working.... hope I have better luck with the Kindle HD....If you decide to buy the Nexus 7 make sure the seller has a good return policy... and if you keep it be sure to get and extended warranty....Hope this helps you...

tablet|I have bought one. The specs are excellent especially the processor.But the screen of mine is just cracked. Many are also complaining that the screen is easily cracked. check it here [...] .The ASUS seems not supporting this problem. ASUS will charge you more than 100 bucks for replacing new one.So next time, although I love Google's product, I won't buy theirs again. Never.

tablet|Finally this product is mature enough that it is a suitable replacement for my iPad. The reality is that as my phone gets smarter my phone got smarter, I needed less and less of what the iPad offered. Currently I use the phone for music, messaging, a few word games. Oh yes, and phone calls. The iPad seemed like overkill for an RSS and e-reader.Prior to receiving the Nexus 7, I had tried the Samsung Galaxy, the Kindle Fire ( first generation ), and found them lacking for one reason or another. I think I am an experienced user of such devices, but have little need for rooting, jailbreaking, or that sort of thing. My difficulties with the aforementioned devices have a lot to do with user interface inconsistencies across applications and input action in their stock presentation. Overly bending a device to my will just isn't appealing to me.So I did up picking up an N7 when it was discounted over the holidays. The device is very light, the size very appealing. It feels like a large paperback. The build seems to be generally good, and with a slim case, it really is a pleasure to wield. Even when I had the iPad, I was primarily using Google to store mail, contacts, and using Google Drive for my documents. With the Nexus, these things are easily equivalent and didn't require much shifting of my habits or workflow.The Google Play store has improved quite a bit. It is still difficult to assess the quality of some of the programs, but in general I haven't had too much trouble. I am pleased that the Android equivalents of some of my favorite iPad programs are available, with the absence of a Goodreader type organizer (any recommendations?).I don't play many games on the tablets, so this wasn't an issue. Temple Run 2 is available now on Android, and that is good enough. The media programs have improved as well. Jump VNC, Citrix, and the Synology apps run in a very similar way to the iOS counterparts, and just as well. gReader functions a lot like Feedler on iOS, and now with Carbon for back up, and Nexus Media Importer to allow external drive use, I'm pretty pleased. The ebook programs work just fine.I was pleased enough that I ended up selling the iPad. It was simply more than I needed at three times the price of the Nexus 7.The device is not perfect, and here are a few caveats: the screen, in my opinion is overly bright. This results in a really lousy battery life. I could go for the better part of a week on the iPad, but may get a day or two on the N7. Additionally, the screen is so bright that I ended up downloading a screen dimming program (Screen Filter). And here's one of the other odd things about the N7: when the screen is set to the lowest level it tends to flicker, which is really annoying. This is a well-known device issue if you happen to do a search and can be bad enough that some people needed a replacement. It strikes me as silly that this screen can't be successfully dimmed to a low enough point without adding a second program to dim even further without causing screen flicker.Another contributor to diminished battery life are the programs that seem to endlessly, seemingly out of nowhere, access their mothership. This could be prevented by turning off the wireless, or installing a management program like Juice Defender I guess. I believe that for the most part iOS manages the activity and termination of programs, and shuts down access better than Android seems to, at least out of the box.But on the whole, the device is a pleasure to use for reading, surfing, and if you don't mind the 7 inch screen, or are as myopic as I am, watching movies on your NAS, VUDU, Netflix, or Hulu (the Time Warner app is pretty good too).

tablet|I did a lot of homework before I bought a tablet and am sooooooo happy I got the Nexus.I have seen/ used/ borrowed a number of others, including IPads, the Samsung, etc, but for the price, apps, interface, screen appearance and the ease of use, the Nexus is a great bang for the buck.My only complaint after a month's use was that they do not have an automatic screen-rotation to shift from vertical to horizontal. (Easy fix-- a 99-cent app installs that.) But it should be built in.I also had to look to find ways to get my Outlook files transferred to Android but did find several solutions. I now have my calendar, tasks, contacts, all loaded in too.So far I have done everything I wanted to-- watched HBO Go TV shows, listened to podcasts, borrowed digital library books, played games, checked scores, etcetcetc. Tons of apps and the Android system is very user-friendly.For $199 or less this tablet delivers.

tablet|There are probably thousands of detailed reviews of this table so I'm not going to even attempt to go there. I waited to buy a tablet because I didn't see a great need for one and wasn't prepared to spend a lot of money on one just for the sake of it. I had seen the Kindle fire and was not very impressed with its processing speed and reviews of other non-apple tablets also seemed lacking. When Google and Asus launched this, at $249 for the 16gb version (plus a bonus $25 to the Google play store) I thought 'wow that's a very compelling price point.' I ultimately bought this for two reasons: (primary) to use while traveling (airport, plane, hotel, etc), and (secondary) I don't have a personal laptop at home and wanted to be able to browse the internet and write emails on something larger than my phone. Overall I'm very satisfied with Nexus 7 and will leave just a few remarks:--The Nexus 7 is very speedy and stable. Web browsing is very fast, HD video plays without any hiccups, and I haven't seen any slowdowns in performance during my limited time spent with games.--I like the form factor a lot. Being able to hold it in one hand with no fatigue is nice, and my case has a little elastic band on the back that allows me to slip one hand through it to make it easier to hold one-handed. When in its case its very similar in size to my Kindle Touch (also in its travel case), so the two fit easily in my bag when traveling.--The screen is not as nice as the new iPads but it's perfectly fine. HD video looks good and text renders pretty crisply on web pages / emails. Those are the two primary uses for me so I don't have a need for a super high def image quality.--Having the Google name on it means you get Android updates sooner than other brands which is definitely a perk.--Charging takes a while but the battery life is quite good (haven't done any testing myself) so this hasn't been an issue for me--WiFi speeds are fast provided you are on a good connection; this is important when you want to download a rental movie and don't have a lot of timeBottom line: If you are interested in a tablet, are not addicted to Apple, and don't want to spend a lot, this could very well be the tablet for you.

tablet|Let me start by saying that I own both an Asus Google Nexus 7 (16GB Wi-Fi) and an Apple iPad (3rd Gen 16GB Wi-Fi) tablet. I've also owned an Android, Droid phone and an iPhone 4s so I'm a purchaser of apps from both the Google Play Store as well as the Apple iTunes Store.I am very happy with my Apple iPad and its amazing Retina display but there are times that I do not want to carry a heaver 10inch tablet around and so I waited for the arrival of Apple's iPad Mini. At $329.00 it was more than I wanted to spend on their base model.That is when I took a serious look at the Nexus 7. The price was a great value at $199.00. I'm told that Google is selling these at little to no profit hoping to make the cost up through the sale of apps. If you are familiar with any Android operating system, using the Nexus 7 will feel intuitive and familiar.While not as polished as Apple products, it's very well-made and very comfortable to hold because it is lite and has a rubber back built in. (Some early models had screen issues due to a glue defect but that seems to have been fixed)Due to its fast processors when surfing the web, pages load quickly and the screen, while not as sharp as Apples Retina display, is still wonderful and text and video look terrific on the 7 inch screen. Games run and look great as well.The only drawback that any non-Apple product has is that the available apps in the Google Play Store are nowhere near the breadth and depth found in the iTunes Store. Plus there are currently very few fully optimized apps for the Nexus 7 to take full advantage of its great screen. That being said, the apps that I frequently use are available for the Nexus 7 so that has not been an issue for me.I've started to use my Nexus 7 more than my iPad because of its portability and I would highly recommend this tablet due to its excellent price, quality and usability.

tablet|This is an iPad to Nexus comparison review since I own the 3rd Generation iPad 3.This is my first android device, and I'm happy I waited to jump on the bandwagon until now. The nexus 7 has become my favorite tablet in the week I've had it, and I see no way back to my larger and heavier iPad 3. I struggled for a while IF I should buy another tablet at all since I already owned an iPad, but I wanted a smaller and lighter frame for reading in NYC subways and buses during my daily commute, and truthfully I was afraid of being robbed out of $700. In the past year, NYC has become the world capital of stolen apple products as iPads are eye magnets everywhere you go, and I don't want to be part of that number.So the decision was between a nexus 7 and a mini iPad, but at the end of the day I decided to try something new and the nexus was considerably - $ 130 - cheaper.First Impression: The Nexus 7 is responsive and fast; multitasking is completely different from iOS and works very well. But the android interface looks much more complex than the straightforward look of the iPad line. Took me a whole day of swiping and configuring to get used to it. But the complexity doesn't make it less appealing. It's in fact much more powerful than I ever thought a mobile operating system could be. I was able to download a large 150mb music album from my storagelocker using Chrome into a download FOLDER NATIVELY. Never having to download a separate app, then add that album into my music collection in the music FOLDER, while listening to music on a Bose bluetooth speaker. On iOS you have to download specific apps to be able to download anything since Safari doesn't handle downloads, and you can't add music to the iPod app without first synching with iTunes, unless you're purchasing from iTunes on the device itself.At the end of the first day, I decided to listen to music on the nexus, and that's when the world came crashing down. The Nexus 7 sounds worse than the first iPhone that came out in 2007, and that iPhone sounded like a drowning man. I could not and STILL CANNOT believe a product this good SOUNDS THIS BAD. If sound quality is something you do not notice, if you walk around wearing those white apple earphones, then disregard this. But if SOUND matters to you, and you will be listening from the NEXUS 7 primarily, with a good pair of 100+ earphones, then this is not the device for you. Music played through earphones sounds muffled, lifeless and FLAT. There is barely any dynamic range in the reproduction, the lows and highs are simply flattened out. And to top it off, the volume doesn't go too high. This is not an issue with my tablet, but an issue with all NEXUS 7 tablets, and it's widely known online. If you're buying a nexus to be your primary source of music, you're in for a headache. It's not good. It's actually dreadful. My 2-year old iPhone 4 has much better sound quality than the Nexus 7. As a matter of fact, my 4 year old Creative and Cowon mp3 players have much better sound quality than the NEXUS 7. I'm eventually planning to buy an amp to see if it will make a difference, but I doubt it.Other CONS:NO SD-card for expansionNo true GPS. You need a data connection to start a route, after that the device will guide you without a data connection, but to begin any traveling, you need WIFI.No backside cameraSome video websites that worked with the iPad don't work with the Nexus 7My PROS:- It's the lightest and most portable tablet I have ever used. It's also the CHEAPEST. And it's a high quality product at that. I can read all my books and PDFs in a light package without worrying about breaking the bank or being robbed.- It's a FAST, responsive operating system, and so far with much more options and features than apple's iOS. I find it hard to use the iPad or my iPhone without feeling restrained. Google NOW is quite simply PHENOMENAL, and the voice command integration with the tablet is also way better than Siri on my iPad. Walking through NYC with google-now giving you tips and directions on what to do and where to go is an experience every visitor to the city should have.- Simple features like sliding your finger from the right corner gives you control over every feature on the tablet - from wifi to bluetooth - fast and easily accessible. No need to jump multiple screens to reach settings. And it fits in my back pocket.- WIFI is WAY BETTER than my iPhone, iPad and actually my macbook. I no longer get those annoying a "connection timeout occurred" messages. The nexus will connect anywhere.Conclusion: I almost returned it due to its bad sound quality. But since I always listen to music via my iPhone or another device, sound quality would not be the deciding factor. Using it daily for a week won me over. It's easily the best purchase I made all year. And if google keeps updating these, the low price is a guarantee that I'll be updating with them.

tablet|Okay just received my new Nexus 10 from Google. It came down to this one or the Kindle Fire HD. For now my early impressions are these:The Good:1. screen quality is as good as the specs say it should be. It is almost mesmerizing to watch a news article, magazine, or any content including my Amazon books. I have an older Kindle and wow this is very interesting. Putting the Amazon books on using the Kindle app was quite easy and simple.2. Speed is stunning.3. Ease of operation is excellent although I have to express amazement that a $500 tablet would come essentially without instructions other than a little diagram of the hardware and telling where the on/off button, volume, HDMI output, etc are located. It is quite intuitive but a few more pages of instructions would have been fine with me.4. Connection to my home wi-fi has been flawless and using the Dish Remote Access app to watch things off my Hopper DVR or live has been impressive.5. As soon as I entered my Google information every app that is applicable to the tablet loaded itself so that part was very easy. Some apps however did not transfer because they are not compatible with the tablet as they are also on my Droid 2 Android smartphone.6. Build quality and feel are excellent. It is a little jewel really. I bought the 32GB and figure I paid something like $25 an ounce so I was expecting it to be good and it is.7. It came with Ice Age preinstalled either for you to stream live or download. I downloaded it and the picture quality is just fascinating. I have watched that movie many times with my Grandkids and I found myself almost unable to put the silly thing down.8. Sound quality excellent both with speakers or headphones.9. Okay how is this for cool. You download a Google Music Manager on your desktop and you then can send your iTunes to the cloud and back to the Nexus 10 in about as easy as I have ever imagined transferring music. Google says you can store 20,000 of your own songs on their cloud. That was impressive. Free is always the right price. To reward Google guess I will have to purchase a movie to download onto the Nexus 10.The Bad:1. Biggest complaint so far is that you can not watch Dish Online because of the lack of a flash player. Hopefully Dish will release an app to handle that.2. Second biggest complaint is much like the first. I am an Amazon Prime member and figured I would be able to watch the instant streaming videos you get with Prime. Nope. Once again you need a flash player. Called Amazon on this in amazement and they explained that while there is an app for IPad customers there is no app for Android customers. Even more amazing to me I was told that I can't buy a movie from Amazon for this tablet. So they are forcing me to go to the Google Play Store to buy a movie? Somebody should really wake up Jeff Bezos and let him digest this. Was the Amazon employee I spoke with correct? Amazon has been my primary source for books, DVD's, and content. Amazon is willing to concede that business to Google? Interesting. Hopefully somebody smarter than me will get a handle on this and soon. My plan is to put several movies on this tablet for those times I am sitting on an airplane and need some entertainment other than reading. I suspect I will not be the only Android tablet owner who will feel frustrated by this.3. The only feature on the Nexus 10 so far that I disabled was the auto brightness feature. It seemed to be changing the screen brightness much to often to me. Putting it in manual brightness was easy and solved that problem quickly.In fairness I have owned this Nexus 10 32GB Tablet less than 24 hours and these are simply my initial observations. Many features like the camera that I have not even explored yet. I will update this when I have more time with the Nexus 10. Also when the Kindle Fire 8.9" HD is available I think I will order one for a gift for my married daughter. For what they would use it for that might be the better tablet for them.UPDATE*****Nov. 20, 2012HBO GO just released the latest app and it is for Jellybean 4.2 and 10" tablets in HD!!! All I can say is WOW! This Nexus 10 display takes full advantage of that app. Can't believe they updated the app that quickly following the release of the Nexus 10.Additionally having had more time now to use this tablet both my wife and I are very impressed. This is a keeper. The Android environment will only get better with more and more apps.UPDATE*****Nov. 26, 2012. Found using a software program called WinX DVD Ripper that I could put any regular DVD on the Nexus 10. Would work for many tablets and it is quite easy. They had it for free for a while. Takes about 30 minutes to convert to MPEG4 and then only two minutes to put on tablet. The movie remains on your desktop in the MPEG4 format so you can watch and delete off your tablet and then always put it back on. Did a comparison between a full HD movie that I bought from Google and the quality of the DVD's I was loading. Yes there is a difference but frankly it is very, very, minor. Tried a few Ultra Violet movies also. Those are fine but apparently when they download to a tablet they download in SD. The only way I have found to have an actual HD movie on the tablet is to buy it from Google. Basically putting my entire collection of regular DVD's on my desktop using WinX DVD Ripper. Very easy to use. Continue to find the Nexus 10 an amazing tablet. The only major flaw involves getting the responsible parties to release some software that would allow the Nexus to view, for example, Amazon's Prime Instant Video's. We are Dish Net subscribers and have a Hopper with Sling Adapter. That works very well with the Nexus 10 and we can watch anything live or on our DVR with the Nexus 10 so kudos to Dish.

tablet|To give you a little background, I was a die hard Apple fan rocking out my Macbook, iPod, and 3GS. With rumors of an iPad mini coming out, I could hardly wait to get my hands on a real 7-inch tablet, but with all the praise of the Nexus 7 and Jelly bean, I was swayed (with the help of iCloud frustrations) to come over to the dark side of Android.The Good:The Nexus 7 is a slim and good looking tablet. After being on iOS for the last 3 years, I have to admit that Android Jelly Bean is years beyond iOS. Going back to my iPhone feels like going back to Mac OS 9. Seriously, the customization of Jelly Bean is amazing. Within 10 minutes I had a custom keyboard that I liked, a new launcher (kinda like a homescreen), widgets, and flash player installed.The device is fast with little to no lag, Google Now, the voice assistant, is useful, and the fact that is device has a real GPS chip in it makes it worth the price.The Bad:I agonized for days whether I should get this or wait for the iPad mini. Promises of an increase in the Android app ecosystem finally got me. The truth is that the Android app ecosystem is good but is no where near as good as theiOS ecosystem. In general, I found apps that exist on both Android and iOS tend to look and function better on the iOS side. This is not always the case, and it is true that Android apps have the ability to do and change more of the UI. Even though, for the average user (those who are not going to be compiling C++ on the go) iOS apps have more to offer.lNo SD Card Slot! Good thing for Google Drive.The Ugly:Some apps are not compatible with Jelly Bean. This is especially true of the two big office apps: Quick Office Pro and Office Suit Pro 6. Now while you may be complaining that I should stick strictly to the device, what else is a tablet good for if not for creating documents, editing excel, and making power point slides? I got my tablet to replace my dying computer. Here is the worse part, Quick Office is owned by Google. You'd think that the people who made the OS and the hardware would garentee or at least fix their app to work on their newest device.Final:After dealing with Android it is hard to go back to iOS. I hope my purchase and app purchase will help bring more developers to this great platform on a great tablet.

tablet|The nexus 7 is a great little tablet. I got to use one for about 2 weeks. But why is this price so high for the 16GB model? On Google Play the 16GB model is only $199 while the 32GB model is $249. Google should offer their product for the same price on Amazon. Until the price on Amazon and Google Play are in parity, people should only buy from Google Play.

tablet|_______________________________________________NOV 29 UPDATE:Google just announced upgraded Nexus 7 tablets to be available on Nov 13. You will be able to get a 32GB Nexus 7 for the price of the current 16GB model.NOTE:My initial review was a Nexus 7 vs. the first generation Kindle Fire and the Nexus was a clear winner. I have now updated my review for the Fire HD. It's a close call but the Nexus' 4-core CPU and its pure Android, more open makeup make it my preferred 7-incher. However, the rest of my family prefers the Fire HD because it's such a great dedicated (Amazon) media consumption pad._______________________________________________We've been using a Kindle Fire since September 2011 (pre-ordered) and I am happy we ordered ours. Soon after purchase it was adopted by our daughter. She is using it to draw and paint, she watches Netflix for Kids on it, she learned how to search Youtube for arts and crafts 'how to' videos and she plays (mostly free) games from Amazon's Appstore. The Fire wasn't a full-feature tablet when it launched but we overlooked its hardware shortcomings, its off-mainstream Android and its locking us out Google's much larger app store because the price was right and because the 7" screen size made it lighter and more portable than the 'full size' 10.1" alternatives. We are still happy with our Fire but we are happier with Nexus 7, our second 7" tablet.Because Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle are both Android tablets very similar in screen size that sell for the same price, I am going to compare the two while I write about my experience with Nexus 7. Whenever appropriate, I will note the differences between Nexus and the Fire when such differences exist. If a feature is present on both tablets I will simply note its existence. I will prefix specific features with an equal sign if both tablets support it equally, a plus sign if the Nexus implementation is superior or Fire lacks it and a minus sign when a feature is better implemented by Fire or is a Fire exclusive.HARDWARE (Nexus 7 but it's a close call)The Nexus comes pretty close to what we normally call the latest and greatest (written in July 2012).+ GPS (Fire lacks it)+ Quad-core CPU vs. Fire's dual-core- 16/32GB models for Kindle vs. 16/32GB for Nexus- Dual-antenna for Wi-Fi on Kindle vs. one antenna on Nexus= Accelerometer= Backlit screen at 1280x800 are identical in specs and looks= Front-facing camera on both= Gyroscope= Micro USB port= Microphone on bothNeither the Fire or the Nexus come with memory expansion ports or a rear-facing camera. The Micro USB interface will allow you to attach flash drives and even powered USB HDDs but the fact remains that if you buy an Nexus 7 or a Kindle Fire HD you are stuck with built in amount of internal storage. At the same time, I will testify that I haven't used 8GB yet on my much older 16GB XOOM. A rear-facing camera would have been a plus.CONNECTIVITY (Nexus 7)The better connected a tablet is, the more useful it becomes. Both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD lack 3G/4G capabilities (Amazon will have a very expensive 4G model later this year), relying mostly on Wi-Fi to stay in touch with the world but there are some differences between the two worth noting.= WiFi 802.11 b/g/n= Amazon's Appstore= Bluetooth+ Near Field Communication (Fire lacks it) It allows two devices that support it to exchange information by touching each other. Not widely used at this time.+ Google Play (Fire restricts access to Amazon's Appstore only)I listed the app stores under connectivity mostly because Amazon made it impossible (unless you hack your Fire) to shop from anywhere other than Amazon's own store and I believe you are confined to Amazon's cloud services. There are no such restrictions on the Nexus. You can use Amazon's cloud, Google's or anyone else's if you so desire.SOFTWARE (Nexus 7)+ Android. Nexus 7 comes with Android 4.1 pre-installed, the latest version at the time I write this. It is very likely that it will be upgradeable to future versions. At the same time, it is not likely that the Fire's custom Android 3.x will ever be upgraded. It's possible but not likely.+ Chrome. It happens to be my favorite browser. Amazon does not allow Chrome on its Fire. Fire's own browser is not too bad but I personally prefer Chrome.= Flash. Nexus 7 or Android 4.1 rather does not support Flash which is too bad but it's because Adobe decided not to support it on Android 4.1. Kindle Fire HD does not appear to support Flash either.BUILD (a tie)I like both tablets look and feel. Both the Nexus 7 and the Fire HD are strikingly beautiful tablets. One little issue for the Fire is its too well hidden power and volume controls but it's something that's likely to be annoying for the first few days only, until reaching for them becomes second nature.PRICE (Fire HD but it's a close call)The Fire HD appears is the less expensive one on the 16GB configuration but the difference is not as big as it may seem. Keep in mind that the Fire comes without a charger so you will have to buy one separately and you will have to pay Amazon some more if you don't want to see ads on it.MY CONCLUSIONSI've been using a Nexus 7 for over a month at the time I'm writing this. I've also been using a Kindle Fire HD for about a week now. I am fully aware that when it comes to 'tablets' the technology changes fast and I have little doubt that it will be surpassed by many newer models but, at the time I'm writing this, I have a personal preference for the Nexus 7 even though I enjoy using the Fire HD and they are nearly on par when it comes to 'media consumption' activities with the Fire HD clearly in the lead when the content's is Amazon.Neither the Nexus or the Fire are perfect. Both tablets, for example, lack memory expansion capabilities and a back camera. However, the Nexus, while selling for the about the same price, beats the Fire in every single category but it's a close call. If you are an Amazon person (like I am) the Nexus gives you the best of both worlds. You can still get your Amazon Appstore and the Kindle reader app but nothing restricts you from using someone else's store. The Fire HD erased the Nexus advantage on Bluetooth, camera and microphone. Amazon's new tables now match the Nexus 7 for many features and they even beat the Nexus on some (Wi-Fi, internal storage). In my case, I will continue to use the Nexus 7 but the rest of the family prefers the Kindle Fire HD.>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;___________________________________________NOTE ON STORAGE (memory)We are doing just fine with our 8GB Kindle Fire and our Nexus 7 is a 8GB model. I went for the 8GB model for 2 reasons: my year-plus experience with a 8GB Kindle Fire and a 16GB XOOM and, I must admit, a 16GB model wasn't available at the store when I bought my Nexus.I agree that 16GB is always better than 8GB and a tablet with a SD card slot is better than one without. Objectively, 8GB may be okay for most of us but not all of us. Our 8GB Fire is less than half-full today and I never needed an SD card for our 16GB XOOM because, after more than a year, I have 4.8GB worth of Apps, 1GB worth of pictures and videos (all pics and videos I took with the XOOM) and 0.2GB worth of Audio.Had I decided to download my music library and the family photo albums on a tablet, 16GB might have been barely adequate and I would have used the SD memory expansion but I never felt that need. With videos coming from Youtube or movie streaming services and most of my music streaming from Pandora or cloud storage or our dedicated Media Server, 8GB appear to be okay (barely) and 16GB are quite plenty. Of course this may not be the case 2 years from now.I would buy the 16GB model if I was planning on storing lots of content other than apps on my tablet or simply wanted 'peace of mind' as in not worry about managing my tablet's storage. If not planning to keep lots of photos or videos or music on the Nexus then the 8GB may be just fine.

tablet|Words fail me on how much I love this tablet. I will say I'm slightly Google-biased, as I've owned Android phones before they were cool (and since), I use all their services (including Google+. Yes, there are people on there), and Google sent me a FREE Chromebook to beta-test it a year or two ago. So, yeah, I'm a little biased... =)BUT, I've waited to buy a tablet. There's 2 iPads (both 3rd gen) in our house, and I do like them, they're worth the $500. However, it's not fun to just play with it. You need apps. Then, apps aren't really fun unless you get the paid version. Then, a $500 tablet becomes $50 dollars more, just to get some basic apps and games! Plus, it's cumbersome and weighty, so if you're playing a game, you'll be sitting it in your lap within 5 minutes.The Nexus 7 has NONE of those problems.1. It's $250. (Yes, I paid $275 for the one here, but I'm a Prime member and I have a store card here, so it made sense to buy from Amazon). It is NOT worth that price. It's worth $400 easy, in quality, look, feel, and performance.2. The wallpapers, widgets, etc. alone can entertain you when you first get it! I customize my screens and change them every week to keep me from getting bored of it, so I gladly welcome how amazing it looks! Jelly Bean is silky smooth and the UI just makes sense, especially compared to Gingerbread, which my phone is stuck with... =(3. Apps. There is enough on the device to get you started (including a copy of Transformers 3. Not that I'd pay for that *particular* title...), and the Play Store has so many naturally free apps that can do almost ANYTHING! Yes, if you get free apps, there will be some with ads, like with iOS devices, but at least you have a choice with almost every app, the prices for paid apps seem MUCH more reasonable, and Google gives you $25 credit just for buying a Nexus 7! $25!4. Size. This was the make-or-break for me. I'm an avid reader. On the iPad, I fell in deep, deep love with iBooks. It was the PERFECTION of e-reader apps. Still is, in my opinion. I can get all my college books online in PDF, and I also have ePubs that I read, mark, highlight in. Owning an Android phone, I've shopped the apps, but nothing came close to the reading experience of iBooks on the iPad's nice 10" screen, the 5+ highlighting colors, and the shelves to keep my books organized.That being said, I had reservations in buying this, as I doubted it could compete.Even w/o a good reader app, it won. A 7" screen for a guy like me, who's NEVER at home, was a much better match than I imagined! It LITERALLY fits in a jacket pocket. Now pants, it'll depend on what kind, but the thought is that I can, will, and have taken this with me everywhere! It fits in my glove compartment, messenger bag, suit coat, jacket, you name it. With that alone, it beat the huge iPad, because now I was reading everywhere, instead of just at home. To make things better, I found an e-reader that's a very close 2nd to iBooks, Mantano reader (GET IT NOW!!), so I don't miss the iPad at all!Cons: Hmm. Well, ummmm.... there's, no.... I got nothing. =)Actually, I have a couple.1. No HDMI port. That is a bummer, especially since Google is pushing their movie and TV selections so much, you'd think they'd give you a way to watch it on more than a 7" screen...2. No 3G model... yet. ;D3. Google Now needs some more work and features if it's going to compete w/ Siri. Not that it's bad, just limited...4. Not many accessories, but how many do you need for a tablet? Phones, sure. But who would honestly dock their cutting-board-sized tablet? More case choices would be nice, though...Basically, I've waited years to buy a tablet, waiting for a decent, GOOD Android tablet. Here it is, finally. It's waay cheaper than iPad, but not in quality AT ALL. It's running pure Android OS, unlike the Kindle Fires. Combining a quad-core processor with Jelly Bean means it's a MUCH better experience than any other Android tablet (I'm looking at you, Xoom), even rivaling/beating(?) an iOS experience!Buy a Nexus 7 if you want a 7", $400 tablet for only $200 from Google.Buy an iPad if you want a 10", $500 tablet from Apple.Other than that, there is no difference or advantage.Rate this if this review helped you in the slightest! (or even if you read it all... =D)

tablet|Updated News as of April 3rd:Google is set to release the 2nd edition of the Nexus 7 in July 2013. Resolution is expected to be bumped up to 1920 x 1080, new Qualcomm Snapdragon processor for increased speed, 2 gigs of RAM, a back camera, and for the cellular plan, LTE. Pricing rumors haven't been released. So, if you can wait a few months, it's probably best to see what Google has in store for the Nexus 7 Second Edition before buying the currently offered Nexus 7.End of Update.Full Disclosure:I own an iPad 3 and an iTouch and a four, going on five year old Motorola dumb phone.I'm not going deep into hardware specs, you can read other reviews for that.[EDIT FOR NEWEST GOOGLE PRESS RELEASE]On October 29th, Google released the updated Nexus 7. The ONLY things that changed was that the 8gb version was discontinued, the 16gb version dropped to $199 and the 32gb version was released for $249 (both available for purchase NOW). The 3G cellular version is on sale starting November 13, 2012. Do not buy the existing Nexus 7 versions at current prices posted on Amazon! You're paying way too much.[/END EDIT]Let's address some of the perceived flaws and some of the real flaws of the Nexus 7.1) Storage. 8gb and 16gb (the two flavors the Nexus 7 comes in) can go real fast real quick in today's age of HD movies. I took my 16gb iPad on a trip and I maxed out with movies incredibly fast, even after I shrunk them down to least tolerable quality. The Nexus 7 does deserve some criticism for no Micro-SD slot and I was not going to buy it for that sole reason. However, like all good Android Tablets, there's a solution.[SUPER BIG EDIT FOR HIGHLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION]:It's called USB On The Go. Essentially you take a USB OTG cable (like $1 on Ebay), plug it into your Nexus 7, download the Nexus Media Importer app (Currently $3 on Google Play) and then connect whatever side hard drive or flash drive you want. The largest size external media I could connect to (and have access too) is a 3TB Western Digital. So much for 8/16 gig limits! The only problem I encountered with large drives is that the Media Importer app (which streams media as well as allowing one way coping to the Nexus 7) is that it crashes when you try to stream media out of folders that contain huge amounts of files, like 3,000 mp3s. If you're cheap, you can do much of the same via Stickmount and a file manager (Stickmount requires rooting). But the Nexus Media Importer just makes it ridiculously easy. Best $3 in credit I spent.With OTG and flash drives you don't need the cloud. Ever. Seriously, whoever decided to not put in the MicroSD to force cloud should be fired at Google.Oh yeah. And this requires absolutely ZERO rooting. Take your Nexus out of the box. Download the Nexus Media Importer App. Buy the cable. Plug in your thumb drive. You're good to go.As of today (10/5/12), I was able to connect a canon point and shoot, iPad 3, iTouch, 4 small flash drives (less than 2 GB), a 1 TB and 3 TB external hard drives (Western Digital), a SD card reader (with regular and microSD via adapter) and was able to pull/stream files off all of them (FAT and NFTS formatting, no EXFAT at the moment sorry!). For some reason my old Motorola ZN5 (ancient eh?) no longer registers anymore, but as long as you plug in relatively new devices you'll be okay. An exception is I plugged in my 9 year old iRiver player and it streamed music perfectly.Don't forget that OTG also lets you plug in and use keyboards (wired and wireless via dongle) and mice without rooting. Mice generate a cursor when plugged in. Also be aware that OTG may charge devices from your Nexus 7. For you true gamers, PS/3 controllers work as well. Not on all games, but games like Dead Trigger they'll work just like they do on a PS/3. Like to see that on a Kindle Fire or an iPad!2) Display. Yes, it's not an iPad. It's also less than half the price of the new iPad. Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done. Not iPad well done, but save yourself $300 well done. It's fairly responsive, not iPad response, but better than many other tablets out there. I have no complaints about it. As for the screen separation, that seems to be more of an issue with the 16gb version than the 8gb. I haven't had any ghosting issues either.3) Camera is pretty terrible. The front facing 1.2 megapixel is nothing to get excited about. And there is no back camera. I honestly don't get why that's just a big deal. You look like a tool using the back camera. Anyone does. Even Olivia Wilde (13 on a total possible score of 10 house fans!) would look like a douche using a tablet's back camera to take video/pictures. Odds are you have your smartphone with a decent camera. Use that. There oddly though, is no app for the camera that ships with the Nexus 7. But there is a free Nexus 7 camera launcher app.4) Apps. True, the Apple ecosystems has far more apps designed for tablets than Android does. But most of your apps, like skype, facebook, office utilities are all there. Furthermore, rather than being stuck on iTunes you can install Amazon's app store in addition to the preloaded Google Play store.5) No cellular connection. Fair enough, but it does have the capacity to get on to a hotspot. Meaning, just tether your smart phone. Granted, that costs money, but the fact that something like 80% of all tablets sold, Android and Apple are wifi only suggests that cellular connections on tablets is highly overrated. If you're one of those 8 out of 10 people who don't care about cell connections on your tablet, this shouldn't obviously matter.[EDIT]: The 3G cellular model available now on Google Play sells for $300. Also, does not support CDMA networks so no Verizon or Sprint. Ships with an AT&T sim card.[/Edit]6) No Flash - This is technically half wrong. While Jelly Bean does not support Flash off the bat, there are FREE fixes to get flash on to your Nexus.Google "Install Flash On Nexus 7"The downside is you need a browser that is flash coded which includes Firefox Beta (free on Google play). It's a bit convoluted but follow the instructions and you'll have your flash games. I've posted pictures on the Nexus 7 8GB image gallery of both flash games AND streaming flash video off my Nexus 7.If an iPad user like me can figure this out, you can too!Now on to other things:Little black rectangle is lightning fast. The five core processor (yes, there are five I'll get to that later) loads things speedy without crashes and without bugs. My iPad crashes apps pretty regularly. Only once has my settings crashed but that was largely due to me screwing up my setup of my Wi-Fi extender. I can't fault the Nexus 7 for that. Speaking of which, the Nexus was super useful walking all over my house and yard to diagnosis network deadzones and other problems. 3/4 of a pound and strong Wi-Fi pick up made that job real easy, especially with free Wi-Fi apps. I could have done that with my iPad, but that would have been far less fun. Also, the Nexus 7 picks up Wi-Fi networks my iPad doesn't.Jelly Bean isn't as smooth as iOS 5/6 but it is better than every other Android device that my friends and family have used (and I played around with).Oh yes, five cores. The process actually has a fifth core that keeps basic services running when the device is in sleep mode. That saves massive amounts of energy. The battery life on the Nexus is better than my iPad without comparison even when doing the same things. The fifth core doesn't operate during normal operations. Battery life on this device is phenomenal.EDIT: On light usage, I am able to get ~195 hours before hitting 5% battery. On medium, movie watching no heavy gaming, I can regularly do ~110 hours before hitting 5%. GPS however, will eat power like nobody's business.What I like about the Nexus 7 is that I can largely customize anything I want. The Nexus ships with a format that is more phone than tablet, but with a Root and a few apps, I was able to switch it to the Tablet UI that you see in 10" Android tablets. I personally prefer that format but it makes icons smaller to fit it all in. Not the best for older people. But that's the great thing about Android in general. Whatever you want to change, you probably can. And the Nexus 7 is no different.Google Voice Search is pretty awesome. It's not as good as Siri in actually reading back answers to you, most of my searches lead to a web search with links. Weather does get repeated in a Siri like female voice. Speak slowly and clearly. Or you'll get weird results. Also, phrase questions more as searches than something you'd ask a real human. Google Voice does not do well with questions like "do I need an umbrella today?" Ask "Weather forecast (your location)."Now, in my opinion, one of the coolest things about the Nexus 7 is in the built in GPS coupled with the free cached maps. Say you're going to visit your friend who's getting married in small town in Iowa. You can either buy a GPS or bring your Nexus 7 with the map of the small town saved to memory. Turn on the GPS and it will track where you on in the town on the map real time no wifi/cell connection required. I downloaded a map of my town and tracked myself going to work. Planning your route out can easily turn the Nexus 7 into a GPS system without any additional costs.EDIT: Note, this doesn't give you turn by turn directions by itself. To get turn by turn directions you need the "NAvFree USA" (there is a Navfree for other countries) app off the Google Play store. It's free. Download your state and set your destination. It gives out voice commands on when to turn similar to a dedicated GPS device. It doesn't name street names which is expected considering it's free, but it is largely accurate saying "in 100 meters, turn right." My recent test of the app did ask me to drive over a divided highway though. As long as you pay attention though, this app coupled with the Nexus 7 will function as decent GPS offline, no wifi, no cell connection. And it even recalculates the route if you miss a turn.Speaker is pretty terrible compared to iPad. But the audio on headphones is on par. I don't expect anyone to really use the speaker so I'm not counting that as a real disadvantage.One thing: if you are a student planning on using this for notes, don't. The screen is way too small to actually take notes well and you need a blue tooth keyboard as well. Virtual on screen keyboard already eats up too much space. However, there is a speech to text and it might work well recording what your professor says. That said, you're better off with either the iPad or the Asus Transformer w/ keyboard. Or a real laptop.All in all I do like the tablet and often I'll reach for it over the iPad. Except when it comes to shopping online and browsing (and Facebook). The 7" is simply too small to offer real competition to a 9~10" screen. The use of keyboard via OTG alleviates this a bit but the screen is still really small.If you're looking to jump into Android, this is the tablet to do so. Plus if you buy now you get $25 in Google Play credit and a transformers movie copy. Not the biggest of Michael Bay but $25 brings the actual cost quite down.Word of caution: the 16 GB versions seem to be affected by a poor manufacturing/QC issues. The 8 GB versions seem to have far fewer problems. If you're okay with OTG external storage, go with the 8 GB version as you're likely to have far less chance of getting a defective unit.One more annoying fact: If you root your device and get a custom recovery, you can't install over the air updates. Found this out the hard way. You have to manually install Android updates.

tablet|Where do I begin? I pre-ordered the 16 GB version directly from Google Play. Since it arrived, I have barely put it down. Setup was easy and it synced flawlessly with my Gmail account, automatically downloading apps I had purchased for my android phone. The touchscreen is very responsive and the system is extremely fast. "Buttery" is a great way to describe it. No lag whatsoever. It is light, but also feels durable. So far, the descriptions of the battery life seem accurate - about 10 hours of web surfing. I had heard about the improved voice searches, but I had no idea they would be this good. It has answered every question I have tried, even with my southern accent. Previous attempts on my android phone were not nearly as successful. This is an excellent product.

tablet|I'm a grandma who loves gadgets (have to keep up with the grandkids:) and when I read all the info on this new Google Nexus 7 tablet, I decided I would like to try one. I have a desktop, 2 laptops, a netbook, a Kindle Touch, and a smart phone so why I needed this tablet, I just don't know. But being the gadget person that I am, I wanted it. Have only had it for a few days (got it for my 70th birthday) but so far it is great. Fast, clear, easy to use and learn and I love the 7 inch screen. It is big enough to see and read clearly yet small enough to stick in my purse. My gd has the Fire which I like but this Nexus 7 is lighter and easier to handle. It will do everything that I need; cruise the net, read books, watch movies, access my 2 email accounts, has lots of storage (16GB) for my grandkids pics and music. My son who is an engineer and is quite computer knowledgeable, says it's Jelly Bean OS is great and he is waiting to get it on his droid smartphone. This tablet provides me with all the tools I need to lay in bed at night and entertain myself without disturbing my husband. All-in-all this is an excellent buy at $249.

tablet|I purchsed one of these through Google Play directly. Was going to get one for my wife, decided to check my favorite store Amazon only to find that they are increadably overpriced here. I hope that changes soon.This media tablet is the perfect $200 tablet. I titled this review that way because most of the negative reviews I read here are due to some of the short comings of this tablet. People really expect WAY to much these days. Why complain about something a cheaper tablet doesn't have when you know good and well that it won't have those features?!?! If this tablet ain't for you, don't buy it and don't bother griping about it either. That doesn't do anyone any good. Plus this is technically a "media tablet", not a full tablet. And you'd really need to wait for Windows 8 release to get a REAL full blown, no holds bared tablet anyway.What amazes me about this tablet is...1. Speed. It's fast, dang fast for an Android based low price tablet. I've used faster tablets, but those cost well over $500.2. Resolution. The screen is fantastic! Bright, clean, great viewing angles, and perfect resolution (16x10 NOT 16x9! That's perfect! 16x9 stinks on computing devices!)3. Power. Great battery life. No, amazing! I've been able to get a full day of heavy use out of this tablet easily.4. Android 4.1. Android is finally getting good. Not perfect, not quite iOS or Windows 8 IMHO but much better than in the past. Perfect for this tablet/task.5. Lightweight. This much power and battery with such a light weight device is amazing.6. Google. Face it, without the full power of Google behind this little guy it wouldn't be 1/2 (or less) of the tablet it is.What doesn't amaze me...1. Fumble! Yep, I tend to fumble this little guy a lot. The touch screen is very reactive, which is a good thing. But I end up accidentally hitting it and changing things a lot when I don't mean to. Plus the soft touch home button to me should be a double press once the button has faded, to keep you from hitting when you don't want to. The backing is very nice and soft, but I still find it slippery. I'm getting a cover for it soon, so hopefully that will help. P.S. I have carpal tunnel issues which makes this worse. YMMV.2. Blinding! Reflective screen glass. Come on Asus! NOBODY likes reflective screens, and it is possible to make them anti-reflective without the "sparkles" Apple fixed it on the iPhone 3GS, (then failed on the 4...) so why do companies still do this stupid thing? It's annoying as all get out!3. Plug it! Minor, but I don't like the micro USB plug. Too fragile. I'd rather see a mini USB plug. Not that much bigger, but much more robust and stronger, and more available.What doesn't bother me in the least...1. Can you hear me now? No cellular. So what. I'd use my cell phone's hot spot ability if I needed internet on the go with this guy. Cheaper that way anyway.2. Flashy? Nope, no Adobe Flash support. Good. R.I.P. Flash!3. Expand! Can't do. No external memory support. You can rig it with connectors and rooting. But Google provides on-line storage, enough to make this problem not a problem.Overall, you really can't get a better media tablet considering the price. Sure you can get something with more features, and pay a lot more. Plus, few will need those features.

tablet|This is my 1st tablet, I uses it mostly for surfing with Chrome browser, Video watching with YouTube and Netflix, Video calling with Skype, playing game, and reading eBooks. This tablet so far, satisfied my needs. I like this tablet over iPad, Kindle Fire, Samsung tab 2 because of- Portability, 7-inch size has less weight and rests comfortably in my hand. I have a lot of cargo shorts and pants and it fits in those pockets.- Zippy quad-core processor and DDR3 memory give me smooth and responsive interactions- The front camera video quality (720) isn't bad with Skype- It has a GPS for the Google maps- High resolution 7-inch screen (the other 7-inch tablet with the same screen resolution that I know of is the tmobile SpringBoard tablet but its price is much higher (wireless carrier rip-off))- Lastly, the rubbery back of the tablet gives me pretty good gripThere is 1 thing that I wished for but this tablet (and Samsung tab 7, Kindle Fire) does not have is the storage expansion. It doesn't have micro-SD card slot and it can't do USB-OTG (hooking up a USB thumb drive to its USB port). However, it connects well to my Windows 7 laptop for file transferring. Google, Amazon, Samsung, Apple want users to use their "Clouds" for streaming files and contents so they discourage the usage of the storage expansion slot. What if I'm on airplane flying for 6 hours and there is no wi-fi connecting to the cloud and the 16GB internal storage is not enough for my movies??I'm planning to buy couple more 7-inch tablets for my wife and my sons and I will wait for the Kindle Fire 2, Samsung tab 3, Barn&Noble Nook 2 to see for any new features that will leap frog the nexus 7

tablet|The Nexus 7 is a truly great tablet.If you want a full open Android tablet or to be able to use GPS Maps you can use anywhere, the Nexus 7 is for you.If you have Amazon Prime, love the Amazon offerings and don't mind a less open experience get a Fire HD, its a great tablet, just walled in to Amazon.In any case DO NOT buy a 16gb or 8gb Nexus 7 until after Nov 1.The 32gb Nexus 7 is slated to replace the 16gb one at the same price as the 16gb one.The 16gb Nexus 7 will probably drop to $200.00 and the 8gb one will fade into history.Hope this helps.

tablet|I was waiting, for Tegra 3 devices, to mature a few mallore months on, when I saw the Nexus 7 was on sale. I quickly put in my order from Google Play online, for my 16B device. I received ita few days later. I powered it on, and was soon at the setup screen. After adding my google 411I was taken to the Google Play store. Within seconds all the apps I have installed on my Skyrocket, were downloading, and installing on my Nexus 7.The games were full of eye candy (Glow Ball, Shine Runner, & Shadowgun THD, to name a few) in the Google Play Store search for Tegra 3 from games and you'll find several, now. Ther will be 25+ titles by years end.(I can't wait)Admittedly, I was shocked to learn Flash Player was not supported on Jelly Bean (according to both Adobe, and the black box on Google Play stating my device wasn't supported). I did some research, and discovered, some ICS device owners were having some issues with Flash, but undaunted, I went looking for the Flash 11.1.5.apk to see if it could work. Since I use Dolphin Browser, when I dwant to use Flash, I downloaded, installed, and opened it from within. I was able to watch an Amazon Prime show, which requires Flash, so I knew it worked. Obviously, Opera, Firefox, and Marathon browsers among others also run with Flash. Thanks to a Developer, you can quickly download, and install Flash. Just look for [Flash Player 11 Downloader] you'll see

tablet|EDIT: please see my post/response comment below regarding customer service and refund issues...... I ordered mine directly from Google Play a couple of weeks ago. Received it within a few days, and it was defective out of the box - dead pixels. Google was great about getting a replacement out immediately, but in the week of use while waiting for the next one, I also had the glass/screen lifting from the tablet on the left that sooooo many people are having (moves when touched and makes creaking sounds - especially not good for gamers). Received the replacement, which is also defective - gray spots in the display screen (almost like the back-lighting isn't working in those areas or is blocked by some debris, or the pixels are just stuck in that color) and major lifting of the glass/screen on the left side before any use. I hate to give it up, because there are a lot of great things about it that I really like, but I'm going to return this one as well and wait to see if they resolve in future build productions. I would not recommend Nexus 7 until they correct these issues, unless you're okay with accepting them. I do realize the price is much lower than other tablets, but there will be other options coming out in the same price range, so hopefully this will help encourage Google/Asus to improve the quality control on the Nexus 7, if they aren't already interested in doing so. You might want to do a web search on defect issues before purchasing, just so you are aware. These two issues I've had seem to be quite prevalent. Both I received were from the July production run, so they haven't addressed them as of yet.EDIT regarding customer service: Google Play customer service is horrible. There are several nice reps, but almost none of them actually follow through to resolve an issue with a return for refund (even from the "managers" that told me they would contact me with a follow up email and didn't, on more than one occasion). It took OVER A MONTH to receive my refund from Google after receiving two defective units and returning both, and that was after MANY phone calls and emails to them before I could get one person who finally truly took responsibility and followed through. If you order this directly from Google and have any issues, you may wait a very long time to get a refund, so you might want to go to a retail outlet to purchase instead, where you can actually get an immediate refund if needed. Google's customer service is nothing in comparison with Amazon's wonderful customer service, and that's a fact.

tablet|It's a great device, the size is very convinient for transportation without limiting the amount of stuff one can do with it and the price is quite perfect.
---
tablet|this is a very well known and consolidated product on the market. I bought it for my nieces as a present and they have been using it everyday for the latest 5 months. Best gift ever I will say.
---
tablet|As with some other reviews I've read, mine would not boot-up or turn on. I only had a blank, dark or flickering screen after attempting to power on. Disappointing, because I was primed to try and take the first step in transitioning out of Apple's seemingly monopolistic ecosystem.

tablet|Wife pick out the wrong item. Great product though. It was brand new in the box and it did everything it was suppose to do.

tablet|100 % recommended, amazing product, deliered in time and nothing more to say, just excellent.I like it so much

tablet|I really love this tablet. If you're looking for something just as good or arguably better than the iPad mini in some ways for a cheaper price. This is definitely the device you need to buy!
---
tablet|It is very easy to use. Also it has the perfect size at least in my opinion, very fast, nice.
---
tablet|And my girlfriend wouldn't put it down sooo I got her one a week later! Both ordered by separate vendors and arrived unharmed and ready to play over our Wi-Fi :)
---
tablet|I recommend this tablet for everyone. It's a great tablet, but sometimes (really few ones) the screen paused, but then 2 seconds later continuous normally.
---
tablet|Definitivamente uno de los mejores productos tecnologicos que he adquirido. Excelente funcionamiento, aplicaciones, buen precio. Bien en todo especto la mejor tablet sin duda alguna.

tablet|Thought I was upgrading from my old Kindle Fire, I was wrong. Returning it because its not an all around better device. Some features are nice like Android 4.2, however I cant deal with the following three issues,1. Scrolling is very slow. A hard swipe will scroll about half the distance a hard swipe on the Kindle Fire. In general I would not say the Nexus 7 is faster than a Kindle Fire, and I still experience some lag especially viewing websites. Try www.harley-davidson.com.2. Google voice does not work well. Try to say "trebuchet settings". I just think the microphone quality is poor. My phone works much better.3. Screen display is not sharp to me. Even though the Kindle Fire has a lower resolution it seems sharper and more vibrant to me. Out of all the tablets I have used I think the Microsoft Surface has the best display quality, Nexus 7 is at the bottom of quality.

tablet|Awesome and with some youtube videos on Apps and what they do this thing is almost taking over my PC, especally w/the Google Drive. I can transfer Doc's to the drive and that will come in handy since I will be using this Tablet for weddings and Preaching sermons.Great buy.
---
tablet|First tablet I've ever owned. It was a choice between this and the iPad Mini. I of course chose the Nexus 7. No problems, no regrets. Looking forward to the next Nexus 7 tablet to be released.
---
tablet|It does everything I need in a tablet. Great! It has pretty much replaced my PC for everyday usage. I highly recommend it.
---
tablet|Fast, light, and completely customizable. I find that nearly every app I have on iOS is also here in the android marketplace.
---
tablet|Just as expected. Good build quality. Fast. Responsive. Excellent screen. Good as a reader and media device. Bravo Google!...and ASUS;)

tablet|I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7" for $180. I was not pleased with the screen res, the build, the Android version, proprietary apps, . I have a smartphone with an HD display (Razr HD)and it looks great. After using the Galaxy for a few I noticed how badly the pixels stood out everywhere. I could not get past the non HD display, it's ugly. After one day of use it also seemed to run a bit slow and had a few other minor quirks. I knew I would not be happy with it for the long termAfter some additional research I switched to the Nexus 7 and I am very pleased to have done so. The display is beautiful. It runs better with the better processor and Android 4.2.2. All Google all the way is perfect for me.If you buy a Nexus over a Galaxy you will be giving up the camera and SD expansion slot.I am able to live with this since I have way too many cameras already. I also do not store a lot on my devices so 16G will be adequate. There are also ways to stream music and video from a flash drive using app Nexus Media Importer and a USB OTG cable.[...]So, the Nexus is much a nicer tablet for only $20 more. If you are debating between the two, now you know where I stand.

tablet|I got my Google Nexus 7 tablet through Groupon a while back, and love it. The operating software is great and all of the apps work just fine. I don't like the way Google Chrome looks when searching the internet, but it works perfectly fine. Battery life is really good too.The casing and backing are great. Easy to hold onto and it won't slip out of your hands.The only issues I have with the tablet are minor, but they are still there. Some apps (The Washington Post app for example) are not compatible with my tablet. Also, The Hockey News app constantly crashes. While the first one is due to the tablet and it's software, the other is likely the app itself.I would have liked a spot to input an micro SD card. The more expensive models have that. I'm not sure how difficult that would have been to put on there, but it would have been nice. Especially since there is only 16 GB's of memory.I don't like that there is no camera on the back. While I would mostly use my cell phone or digital camera for taking pictures, it would have been nice to have one. Especially with apps like Skype or for taking photos around the house.The last issue I have is creating a wallpaper. Some pictures I use come up looking stretched out. Perhaps this is user error, but if not that could be a little better. Still a very minor issue.Overall, I think this is a great 7 inch tablet. I got the Skytex Alpha 2 a year or so before and it is no where near as good as the Nexus 7. With the Alpha 2, apps wouldn't work, and after a while the tablet would no longer download apps. I have had no software issues with the Nexus 7, or minor convenience ones. I would highly recommend getting one.

tablet|He found what he need out from a tablet , and i found a very reasonable price. So, both persons happy.
---
tablet|I bought this tablet for my daughter for Christmas. She is a college student who is always on the go. This tablet works perfectly for her. Some of her friends who have iPads really like her tablet a little better. It's sleek, easy to navigate and just an overall solid piece of technology.
---
tablet|Good device, disappointed with the cheap hardware.Basically, as shown in the pictures in the link below the screen broke, but I'm still not sure how it happened. The device was in my jacket pocket. It must have bumped into something in my commute to work (subway, elevator, etc), but I swear, nothing of that sorts of force or impact otherwise I'd have felt it. Also, check the outer frame and notice there is no scratch or dent or any sign of damage. I guess you get what you pay for. My iPhone is still good after dropping it several times on concrete floors.[...]FYI: I've contacted both Google and Asus, but no luck on getting it fixed or replaced under warranty.

tablet|What a joy! Fast and easy to use. Android adds an appealing proposition to this most sought unit. More of this stuff!
---
tablet|It's amazing I love it!Step almost two hours every day playing! the actualize the latest android system and going great, very fast and elegant.Blindly recommend it!
---
tablet|Best tablet I have seen thus far. I would love it if it came with the Microsoft office pack version 2010 or newer.
---
tablet|Got this last December and am very impressed. If you already have an android phone like me, it will automatically sync everything from your google account. It doesn't have a cellular connection, but I don't miss this at all as I just tether it to my phone when I am out. It has replaced both my laptop and my kindle, and after selling both those devices I actually made money on this purchase. Pair it with a case with a stand and a bluetooth keyboard and it will do anything a laptop will do. Don't know why the price is 249 on here when you can get it from google play for 199 though.
---
tablet|My son gave the Google Nexus to me for my birthday. I have had it about six months now and I LOVE it. It is fantastic so portable easy to use integrated all of my stuff from laptop and my android phone. So it all synchronized and when I want to do something quick I use my tablet instead of my phone or laptop. I no longer play Angry Birds on my phone only on my tablet. It was difficult at first to acclimate because the motions are a bit different due to size difference and smaller hands but once I discovered how to achieve the same results as I had on my phone it was spectacular. I would highly recommend this device to anyone.
---
tablet|I have used many 7 inch tablets but this one is by far the best one, its has everything you'd expect in a tablet. Its size is great, I can take it anywhere easily and its very user friendly
---
tablet|I got this Nexus 7 after having multiple Android smartphones over the past 4 years. Wow, it is like a whole different world being able to see things on a huge high-res screen, although I find the auto-brightness setting to err on being too dim. The physical unit is great and well-made - the soft-touch back is especially expensive feeling. This tablet is quite easy to use with one hand. Performance is very good, but there have been a few hiccupps (i.e. stutters, freezes) beginning after installing only one app. Battery life is excellent; I can make it through two days of light/moderate use (I primarily use my laptop and desktop for heavy computing). While it is nice to get updates directly from Google right when they are released, I have a couple issues with ICS & Jelly Bean, namely affecting power users. It's very confusing for a new owner to get into the developer mode. And, effective with ICS there's no task manager, something developers and tinkerers like. However, those are items a normal user could probably care less about. Overall, this is a great value and perfect for 95% of users out there.
---
tablet|Having used the 10&#34; tablets and several iPads, nothing beats the Nexus 7 tablet! Android Jelly Bean makes what is already a great piece, even that much better. The display and the ease of use definitely beats anything else I've experienced in the under-$500 class.Should Google decide to produce this tablet in 32 gb or 64 gb, it would definitely be my single media device.
---
tablet|Better than any other tablet its size. Good price, a shame it doesnt have the Expanded Memory feature (SD card slot). Otherwise excellent.
---
tablet|i personally already had a nexus tablet and was buying it for someone else. i returned it but i totally give it 5 stars. mine is wonderful and i take it everywhere
---
tablet|So great! But I really wish it had an SD slot! Besides for that it's great!!! Very clear screen. Got it for my wife and she just loves it! Can't say enough good about it!!
---
tablet|all around a terrific tablet for all of my general needs.the size, speed, capabilities and ease of use all make this device worthwhile.
---
tablet|Loved it very handy tool. Great companion for travel. Not as restrictive as the Ipad. Great battery life and lightweight.
---
tablet|I love my tablet! Google did a fantastic job. Previously, I used my iPhone to do all my tablet-related stuff (web surfing, reading, playing games). No more eye strain or pecking the screen (hello, swyping)! Playing Super Nintendo games are awesome (can't do on iPhone). No lag in the system, even with multiple heavy apps up. Quick to respond. GREAT product at a steal! HIGHLY recommend!
---
tablet|great device. Has some issues.the speaker is horrible.even with a downloaded booster app you can barely hear it. really bad sound.The camera is a joke. There is no back camera. How do you line up a picture?but overall we enjoy the device. And for the price it's not bad.
---
tablet|Yes, I recommended this tablet. It is very handled, because is thing and small! The relation price versus feature is incredible!!
---
tablet|I was told about this tablet from a co-worker and she love it. I like the idea that you can talk to put into the tablet.
---
tablet|Great Tablet. However Jelly Bean no longer supports Flash. Also there is no away facing camera. Overall a great value if those are not a problem for you.
---
tablet|I am very pleased with the Google Nexus 7. Fast, powerful and sleek. I have not come close to unlocking all the features yet. No issues with screen or failures as reported by other users. I don't use a case or screen protector either.
---
tablet|I've been using this table for 4 months without issues so far, it is faster and always responses quickly even playing games, doing web surfing or watching hd videos, so far I haven't noticed any problem with it as I said before. if you want to play games and navigate on internet this tables is for you, otherwise look around for other models since this one cannot use SD cards, it means that 16GB is not enough these days. you'll probably need more memory soon which is frustrating using the OTG cable.Pros:FasterNice resolution.tons of apps.Cons:Poor facetime camera.no SD slot.
---
tablet|I love the Nexus 7. The embedded Tegra 4 chip is absoultely perfect for gaming. The display is beautiful, not to mention I think it's the perfect size for portability, reading, and viewing just about any media. Asus has managed to package a beautiful display and powerful processor into an affordable package that I couldn't have loved more. It did, however, crash, a couple of weeks after I received it. Dealing with Asus was relatively easy, but the product did break nonetheless, so I can't give it a full five stars unfortunately.
---
tablet|My wife couldn't live without it! She only has ONE complaint... no rear facing camera. Other than that, this is in her hands every moment of every day. Great buy!
---
tablet|Part of what I love of nexus 7 is the price I paid. I traded in my original Kindle fire at Gamestop and got $100 trade in on a brand new 32gb nexus 7. Then we discovered box seal was broken so was given an extra 20% off! So I paid about $100 for a state of the art android tablet. Trading in? Go to gamestop's website.I won't make comparisons to ipad because I don't have one and because that's not the target of this device. Completely open android environment is amazing after being locked into the heavily curated amazon world. I can do everything on n7 that I could with kindle fire. Amazon prime video? Yup. Kindle books? Yup. Go to YouTube and do some research and within 15 minutes you will have a nexus 7 that can stream flash video, play amazon videos, etc. I use this for everything now. Be sure to buy SwiftKey keyboard app and the right cover. I bought a bluetooth keyboard but SwiftKey is so good and Google voice to text is so accurate i don't use it much. anyway, the n7 exceeds my expectations in every way.
---
tablet|Have two of these units and no problems from either one. Easy to use and I love the fact that it sync with Andriod phone seemlessly. I wish it was more compatible with the NFL mobile...Great buy!
---
tablet|Google Nexus 7 is a great product for the price, but with one major flaw which needs to be corrected.The input microphone is not adjustable which makes it next to useless as a recording device.And there is no way to use an external mike (audio,usb or bluetooth).A super app exists - Audio Evolution - for doing multitrack recording. But it is next to useless due to this limitation imposed by google. When will it be fixed?
---
tablet|I really like my new tablet. It is really easy to use. I have one thought though. It states there is a front view camera but I still have not found out how it works. Is there an app to download first.
---
tablet|Why be limited by a nook or a kindle fire or the walled garden of Apple and ios when you can have the newest version of android and do most everything the others can do but a lot more ...no issues with the hardware... I think they have gotten them sorted out...
---
tablet|Great tablet and great price. Graphics are clear and bright. Works great for apps, internet...just about everything! Highly recommend to all users!
---
tablet|i bought this for my wife as a gift. she fell in love with it right away. it has everything you need right at your fingertips. she has a phone that is an android, so this was very easy for her to understand.tablet is fast and easy to use.
---
tablet|Although the memory is only internal, this is a pretty decent tablet. It does what I need it to do and that's all that matters.

tablet|Simply love it. Not much more to say- it was a toss up between this and the ipad mini, and I made the right choice for me. It's exactly what I needed.
---
tablet|i bought this because itnis cheaper than an ipad and does more than it besides having a back facing camera i love this! it is small and comfortable to hold. the back is very nice and is rubbery and doesnt slip if i put it on glossy materiaks. the screen is not too stury as in yhe sense i wouldnt drop it because this isnt apple. i love this device and wouldnt change too much about it to be the perfect tablet. what i can say is all i wouls do is make the hardware a bit more sturdy and add a camera. buyt this tablet will not be getting returned its probably better than any kind of kindle and 16 gb is fine because i barely even use 8 gb of it
---
tablet|Love this tablet, it's super fast online and really easy to set up and use. It was a great price and shipped quickly. I would use the store again.

tablet|First I am going to get right to the bad since this will be short. Some of you have already read that this device has no external memory slot, no HDMI port and no cellular connection. So if your intent is a device so you can constantly surf the web than this is not the device for you. By design you can tell that Google wants you tie the user to their services as you won't be able to read memory from external devices. That is until you install Nexus Media Importer app. Still my only complaint is that whoever decided to not put in a HDMI port or a Micro SD slot should be fired. What I really can't understand is why Google opt for no HDMI port? Since you are almost tied to the movies on the Google play site. An HDMI port would increase their online movie sales from anyone who travels a lot and doesn't want to pack a laptop or large tablet like the ASUS Transformer Prime TF201-B1-CG 10.1-Inch 32GB Tablet (Champagne) That I also own. I personally don't intend to buy many movies since they would be UN-viewable without a WiFi connection. So for traveling purposes I will keep downloading my movies on the ASUS Prime. Still I did purchase 2 movies just to test the quality of the screen and my WIFI streaming. I watch Green Hornet and Transformers 3 and the screen resolution looks great and battery life is on this device is great but another downgrade as it does drain a little faster when playing games. As a photographer I bought the Nexus 7 because of it's size. The device works great with the Nikon wireless mobile adapter utility app and allows me a much larger screen for viewing raw shots after shooting when I am near a WiFi source keeping my photos off the web. The photos I do upload on Google's Picasa website or photobucket allows me a cloud type site to show potential clients my work on a screen much larger than my smart phone. I pre-ordered the 16 GB version directly from Google Play and I love using it around the house or at the studio. I have also downloaded several apps to use when I am away from the house that do not require WiFi. The touchscreen is very responsive, the system is extremely fast and I've only experience lag time once while playing the Need For Speed app.
---
tablet|I looked at many of the tablets on the market and decided on this one mostly based on it's use of the android market (google play). I absolutely love it. Though I did not get a manual with it, the time it took for me to figure it out was minimal. It works and functions almost exactly like my smartphone, just a bigger screen.
---
tablet|Wish It had a SD slot. Have not had any problems with it. Perfect size to carry everywhere with no hassle.
---
tablet|This will be my 2nd Nexus 7 purchase of this year :)This is a great tablet for almost all activities - reading, playing games, emails, movies, you name it !
---
tablet|I am the recent owner of an Apple Ipod touch 4th gen. I really enjoyed my experience with the Ipod but it was lacking in many areas so I went looking for another product. I saw the Google Nexus 7 and, after several weeks of indecision, I made the buy. Wow! I love everything about it! I payed the low low price of $199 and it was well worth it! I love the GPS capabilities as well as the Google Maps! I can just save the maps for where I am going and works like a charm! The screen is huge and the access to several browsers makes surfing the web a snap! I would encourage everyone who is turned off by the steep prices of Apple to get this tablet! It is a STEAL!!!
---
tablet|Has a long life time on battery, perfect screen and quite good performance! Android is still having several annoying things - but with every release it becomes better and better.
---
tablet|great toy. my son is getting a case with keyboard and i think it will make a great combo and make this quite the practical item to carry around. a guy finds himself having to connect every time he turns around these days. with the wifi's around there is not much trouble in getting the job done. this does not have 3g but i do not want nor would like to be paying the price for 3 or 4g.
---
tablet|This is a very good tablet, the quality is really great for a price of $200. HD screen, quad core processor, 1GB of RAM, the list goes on. This tablet should be priced at $299, but google is pretty cool. With android 4.2 on the tablet you have the freedom to do a lot of things and everything is very accessible, the procossor is standard at 1.3GHz but it still seems blazing fast, you can root it and overclock the processor to 1.8GHz if you wanted to. Anyway, it is great for social media apps, skypeing/video chatting, watching youtube videos, it is the ultimate entertainment tablet. The only problem that i have with it is that there was no light included to indicate when the tablet was done charging. Other then that i couldn't be happier, it doesn't get too toasty, the battery life is long, very slim and portable, and overall a great tablet. The only other thing i can say is if you plan on buying it online buy the tablet from google play, its $225 out the door with shipping.
---
tablet|I spent hours reviewing different tablets to get as a gift for my sister. This one got the better reviews based on product quality, screen resolution, processing speed, and price. My sister loves it! She's not very tech-savvy but she easily got the hang of it with a few coaching tips and youtube tutorials. I definitely recommend this tablet!
---
tablet|Purchased for my 12 year old niece. She really loves it. I am used to an iPad so it seemed a little small at first but I love the greater flexibility/control over the OS that Apple refuses to allow. Perfect example is the ability to not only see what is draining your batter but also being able to close applications.
---
tablet|Awesome product. I love the size its not too big or bulky but not so small that it feels like holding a phone. couldnt be happier with it.
---
tablet|Works great and as advertised. Bought as a gift and it was well received. No problems getting it to work right out of the box.
---
tablet|I an older and technology is so not my thing. I love this little device. There is a learning curve but not hard. I am having a ball-good reviews and low price sold me and I would recommend it highly.:-) :-) :-)
---
tablet|A must have product from google..nexus 7 is too good...i bought this tablet a few months ago...its awesome...Amazon on the other hand did a great job in getting this product to me on time...i am very much impressed from Amazon and their delivery timeliness..overall i am satisfied with this tablet...Google and Amazon.com rocks!Cheers!Sharan
---
tablet|got this unit while vacationing with my Brother. It turned out to be one of the featured products of the trip. It's Android OS is quite adequate for all situations and ease of use is much desired.I would definitely buy another.
---
tablet|its amazing, i use the powerful GPS in my engineering work, and i find it helpful to my work especially google earth and the off line google earththanks
---
tablet|Really enjoyed it initially and I just keep finding uses for it. Great fit for my hand size and even fits in my back jeans pocket.
---
tablet|Best 7 inch tablet on the market. Period.ASUS makes their products represent the gold standard. This is a huge leap forward.The best specs I appreciate on this tablet: Tegra 3 processor, Android 4.1 jelly bean, and screen quality. I don't use the tablet all the time, but I still like using it for gaming.
---
tablet|Pretty good but some annoying weaknesses:* no dual band Wi-Fi (i.e. no Wi-Fi N 5GHz)* no slot for additional memory (SD card)* no connection port for external display (e.g. projector)
---
tablet|The Google Nexus 7 is an amazing tablet to buy. As a resident in the Middle East, i find it quick and easy to use.
---
tablet|for me is one of the best products launched, fast, very very fast, good resolution the best relation cost x benefit...
---
tablet|Fast with great screen resolution. Love the size, you can hold it with one hand easely, ideal for read news magazzines etc.games runs smooth, and you can attach all kinds of USB controllers, drives, cameras- sony nex 5, you ll need a otg USB cable forma that
---
tablet|Arrived quickly and was fine upon arrival! PAcking was in tact. Nexus was fully operational upon receipt and started up quickly
---
tablet|It comes with two sheets (if I remember correctly) and save you some money for replacing it for new one once the first sheet gets some scratches or if you get a new tablet. I've been using it for a month or so and I dont see any scratches so far. Easy to use. I recommend this product!
---
tablet|I love the Nexus 7. It's my first tablet, and I currently have a Galaxy Nexus, and a Google TV, (plus a Chromebook). I am able to sync my bookmarks, search history, across all of these devices. Plus, the Nexus 7 is the best size for a tablet at 7". Anything that needs a larger screen, I'll use my Chromebook. Plus, the Google Play store has everything I need, from apps, to movies/tv and music, and now books and magazines!
---
tablet|My daughter LOVES this. She is pretty much the techy of the family and says this is the best android tablet out there. Yes I would recommend purchasing this.
---
tablet|Pros: light weight, screen resolution, security, battery life, on board GPS antenna to use with any offline Navigation, Google Play store rocks.Cons: No flash player, it still does not support Tom Tom Navigation app, speakers are not loud enough, I have heard and also noticed that after some use screen starts squeaking from the edge. So far no major issues.
---
tablet|I got the nexus beacause it was cheap, but then I grew to find out that it was amazing. It has great battery life and great resolution. It has a great touchscreen but the charger cable is really short
---
tablet|I can't say more than that. Absolutely amazing! Fast, intuitive, slick latest android. And I agree with a lot of reviewers - this is the best 7inch tablet on the market.
---

---
tablet|Its the best android 7&#34; tablet for the 2012, i found it for 185$, like new no issues no scratches. Only the screen issue to adjust the screen because comes little loose. I found a tutorial online how to repairing it using a pair of glue drops, and fine function perfect. Recommend seller says product like new and was not disappointed me.
---
tablet|Pros:- Bright screen, very comfortable to work in day light and with electircal light.- very fast - performance is great;- touch - is very sensitive.- easy to configure and lot's of applications.- charges very fast;- size is a pluss especially for woman, easy to handle and you can put it almost into any purse; on the other hand the size of screen is enough to read from it, or to type an email. For month that i'm using it i've never though &#34; if it has bigger screen&#34;.I like it very much.Cons:- hard power button.It has no small camera, but i didn't use it at all, so don't think this is a minus.
---
tablet|Everything was perfect - timely delivery, works fine. I wish it has backside camera too. Additionally I bought B Male to A Female adapter, which is on the picture, but doesn't included.
---
tablet|it is a grate device grate graphics but this one was a bit to lacking in space for me . but as soon as i bought this one they came out with the 32gb version . well my lost . i sold it, so now i am waiting for one that has data and micro sd
---
tablet|The google nexus is the coolest machine on the market. It rocks it arrived on time, and it meets my needs totally.
---
tablet|My Google nexus has served me well since December. The battery life is decent if you don't leave it actively connected to wifi and constantly getting notifications (this has been the only downfall I've ran into, but is more user error than the products fault). Beautiful clear screen and great responsiveness.
---
tablet|Excellent, it,s really convenient.:-)Google play really allows you to access so many free apps it,s amazing.I.m glad I purchased this product.Nu
---
tablet|This tablet well surpassed all expectations! If you're contemplating which type of tablet to go with, this one will not disappoint. It's large enough for full functionality yet small enough to easily take around with you.
---
tablet|My first wish for my Google Nexus is that it had a camera on both sides like my IPOD. The seconds is that I could save internet pages to a place where I can return to them without using more internet to retireve. Like a save file. If you can do that on the Nexus, I haven't figured out how to do it yet, only bookmark the pages to access later while using up more internet (as you have probably figured out, I do not have unlimited internet...)I have had the Nexus for 8 months and love it tremendously. And although the guy at Staples where I bought it said it has Gorilla glass, in fact it does not, it has Corning break resistant glass, which I think is pretty much a similar thing, however it is not actually Gorilla glass per sae.
---
tablet|I did not buy my device from Amazon but from Staples and here it is 6 weeks later and I had to send it back because when I went to turn it on one day, there was no screen! I actually loved the device but when you pay $200 for something you expect it to work for awhile and not have to return it only after using if for a short time! I had read where other people had a similar problem so I am not sure if the problem I had was with a certain batch of the product but I am really disappointed that at this time I am without it! It has been 1 1/2 weeks since I sent it back and I have not heard anything from ASUS regarding it!Terry G
---
tablet|I picked this one up off the Google Play Store, and figured this was the best place to get a review out about it.For a device that's supposed to be "pure Android" I thought there was a lot to be improved upon. Within days of it's initial release there was already root methods out as well as ROM's and Kernels for it. But, being that this is a Nexus device, I've kept mine completely stock.After I got it started it prompted me for all the software updates, and was quickly up to 4.2. While it's still "JellyBean" it has a different feel to it, but not enough for a "5.0" upgrade.I noticed it was buggy and laggy and did a bit of reading, turns out that Google Currents is the culprit, so if you have issues I recommend disabling it and see if it improves.Battery life has been ok, I spend my time messing around on games, some streaming (Hulu/Netflix), some writing with a Bluetooth keyboard, and general web surfing. You'll notice the battery take a hit if you're doing more of the streaming or graphics intensive games, but in general I've seen 5-6 hours of general use out of a charge. I recommend a quick-toggle widget to turn on and off some of the power hungry settings (bluetooth, wifi if not used, screen brightness, etc), and that'll help out a bit.I've seen a lot of comments about only having 16gb of storage, and I'll say that I think a lot of tablets are going to go this way. I think they'll start cutting down on the memory and start having their own "cloud" storage. For this I have movies, documents, and a few other files stored on my Google Drive and/or Dropbox. The problem here comes when I'm not connected to Wifi, but I've been tethering to my GS3 and have had decent results. So, for now the 16gb storage isn't a dealbreaker for me and for most users I don't think it will be. If you're more of a power-user or have lots of movies/games you want immediate access to I'd recommend the larger model.Graphics: Well I don't think you can beat it. Colors are sharp, very crisp on the display.Size: Very light and easily portable. Threw a case on it and have no issue throwing it in my backpack on my way to work. I found myself using this a lot more than my original iPad, and when I went to use the iPad I was surprised at how large the screen seemed. For a portable device I think the 7" screen is the "sweet-spot."Only because of the laggy buggyness of it am I giving it 4 stars. As far as the headline of "Not quite there yet..." I'd say that for a first gen tab from Google/Asus it's not bad, but if you want a tablet with zero issues I'd say wait for their next generation of tablet. Some of the early orders had screen-lift problems, some graphics problems, battery problems, and a few others. Looks like everything is sorted out now, but that's almost to be expected from a first gen item.As far as recommending this to anyone, I'd say if you're more "techy" and know about rooting, kernels, flashing ROM's, then this is an awesome tablet for you. If you're more of a regular user I'd say go for another Android Tablet/iPad Mini.

tablet|First off, I would like to say that I have used the Ipad 2, Ipad mini, and Samsung Galaxy.This is better than all of them. It is small enough to be convenient and lightweight.It is big enough to give you a great HD display.I have not experienced any lag at all on my Nexus 7. The processor and ram in it are top notch.It comes preloaded with tons of useful apps, and downloading more is a breeze.The speakers are high quality, and sound great.My only complaints:The lack of rear camera (only 1 front camera for video calls)There is no expansion slot for tan SD card. You can easily get around this though.Go buy this tablet right now.

tablet|For the price, I can't complain about this device. It has met my expectation and while I might want to see more in the way of applications for the device, I think it is a good purchase.
---
tablet|I love my Google Nexus 7. It's an amazing tablet I can't seem to put it down. I wanted a tablet but I didn't want to spend $400+ on an iPad, and I already have an android phone so i went with this one. Wouldn't recommend another tablet. Hands down my favorite.
---
tablet|I use this table everyday for everything from listening to music,reading, playing games, going on the internet (FB, email, shopping, etc.) and watching tv by streaming it through my home cable (via Time Warner Cable app!) Its fantastic! I have not had any issues with it thus far. Prior to this I had a Coby and wow what a difference! This is also very fast! Just purchased a second one for my daughter for Christmas. I know she's going to love it as much as I do! Great buy!!!
---
tablet|Have good quality and is very fast. The principal reason that I bought this product was for reading pdf's files and that device can do that easily.
---
tablet|I bought mine slightly used but the tablet works great. I am very happy for my purchase. It runs fast, battery lasts quite a while. Only downside is hulu does not play on it :(
---
tablet|Just got mine about a week ago and really like it. The size is perfect for work and the screen quality is great. Biggest issue I've seen is not as much available in terms of apps and books as Apple. Otherwise, I really like it.
---
tablet|The Google Nexus 7 tablet is an excellent device. It performs the functions of an e-reader very well. Also it allows me to check email easily, and has access to the Google Play Store which has a large selection of apps, music, books, magazines and movies. It does not have mobile web access, however. A WiFi hotspot is needed to get to the web. So far, this is only a slight inconvenience and the only downside to the device I have encountered.
---
tablet|What a great product! The only regret I have is not buying the 32Gb version. Was released the day I bought it. The OS is smooth, better than the Samsung's customized I have on my Galaxy SII. Absolutely recommend it.
---
tablet|I can not really describe how excellent this tablet is! My family actually fights over it.It is very fast, stylish, and the form factor is spot on. My mother uses it as a media player during the mornings, my brother uses it for gamming and my sister uses it for chatting, now if they would let me use it, it would have been perfect.
---
tablet|The packaging is in great condition and all items are there. I am very happy with it but may need to root it if I want special features. :)
---
tablet|OK, I've had my Nexus 7 for six months and it's time for a review. I was looking for a pad of this size to come out ever since the IPad took the world by storm. I liked the idea of the IPad but it was too big and pricey for what I wanted to do, so when this and the Kindle HD came out, I was loaded for bear and began shopping. After comparing it to the Kindle HD, I decided on the Nexus 7. First strengths and weaknesses.Strengths:Amazing battery lifeCase can be carefully opened if/when the battery starts to degrade so battery can be replacedGreat priceVery good WiFi rangeSuperb graphicsSleek lookingNearly zero lag when browsing the net (of course this is dependant on a good WiFi)Google Chrome is great if you are used to using Internet ExplorerWeaknesses:Quite possibly the poorest user's manual ever seen. They seem to assume that all customers are smartphone users and will be able to "hit the ground running" without guidance. If you are tech savvy or already own a smartphone, this won't be a problem. Otherwise a Kindle HD maybe a better choice.Will not (unless you use a difficult wworkaround) run adobe flash. Flash is supposedly being replaced by HTML4, but nobody bothered to tell anyone but YouTube so it's a major pain to access a video and then be unable to view it.The basic model is totally WiFi dependant. If you work in a WiFi environment and/or have one set up at home, you're in great shape. Otherwise, it will be frustrating. But this is a major reason why the price is so good so know what you'll need before you buy.In short, I'd buy mine again and to me there is no bigger praise for an item.

tablet|The middle of the touch screen didn't work well. The tablet would go to the home screen right in the middle of doing something. I sent it back.
---
tablet|This 32GB Google tablet is amazing. I take it everywhere. Its fast, easy to use, and you can't beat Google's price for the quality.
---
tablet|Love it!!!!!Best tablet I have ever owned!The graphics are good. you will need to download camera app to the camera to work but u will love it
---
tablet|This is one of the best tablets that I have ever used. Fast, nice size screen and very easy to use.
---
tablet|This tablet is just what is needed when you go on a trip or are outside you home. Comes with the latest software and battery holds charge for a long time.
---
tablet|I do like my new tablet, however I bought it on the assumption that I would be able to download games from my facebook. Some the game are not available for International which was a bummer. The popular bejewled game is not even available for this android, which was the main reason I bought it, nor can you take proper pictures with it. You can take pictures of yourself but not of anything else. Hopefully there will be some upgrades to this, if not I will have to buy something else that can accomodate what I would like to have.

tablet|I bought 2 Nexus 7 16GB units just before Thanksgiving, one as a gift and one for myself. They are fantastic! Build quality is good, battery life is better than many reviews say. I paid $199 each, so I got 2 for the price of 1 iPad Mini. There are forums online and videos on YouTube that explain how to customize you Nexus and you don't have to be an IT person to do it.WiFi only, but still very useful. One neat feature is the Google Maps, which can be made available offline easily and then even without connectivity you can use it to navigate. I bout a Seagate GoFlex Sattelite to use with them on vacation, so the relatively small internal memory isn't a huge problem. I love this!
---
tablet|I would rate it four stars if not for the severe misrepresentation of its wifi capabilities. I got it, the tech specs said it could do wifi-N ... but it can't, not at 5GHz. I consider it a severe misrepresentation because the whole point of the N specification was to have that 5GHz band that doesn't interfere with bluetooth. They should not advertise wifi-N capabilities without 5GHz, period.Another serious issue is that the display doesn't hold a candle to an ipad or ipad-mini. It's only 'ok'. Partly because the display pixels themselves are quite soft, but also because most of the video apps (netflix, youtube) appear to to be upscaling lower-rez video streams instead of providing the correctly-sized stream. A good chunk of this problem is likely related to the lack of consistency with android tablets in general (something you just don't have with Apple devices), but I also think the display technology leaves something to be desired in this device.For a quad-cpu device it's not as snappy as the ipad mini. Most of the time those extra cpus just don't have anything to do, and most apps are going to be single-threaded anyway so it's a bit of a waste. Still plenty fast enough for all use cases though.The lack of secondary storage is well known so not really a detriment for review purposes. I still find myself wanting it, though. I am loath to ask Dogcatcher to cycle a hundred megabytes of storage each day from auto downloads onto internal non-replaceable storage.Other than that it works as advertised.-Matt

tablet|THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT AND I GIVE IT TO MY SON. HE IS VERY PLEASE WITH IT. FILL ALL THE EXPECTATIONS. I SHARE IT WITH OTHERS.
---
tablet|I truly do. I use this thing daily everywhere I go. It has a great screen resolution and many features. I never thought I would depend on a mobile device but I have been lately. Definitely worth it.
---
tablet|First of all, I am a huge Apple fan however wanted/needed a device for multiple users, which led me to the nexus 7. I havent used an android device since my first Droid X and am impressed with how it has come. The tablet has a great feel to it, sturdy, sharp screen, and is pretty quick. I honestly like this device far better than my Kindle Fire 8.9&#34; HD. I reccommend this tablet to anyone looking for a 7&#34; tablet.
---
tablet|I love how fast it got shipped, the best bang for my buck and since its made by Google I get updates asap! You can never go wrong with a nexus 7 :).BTW I highly recommend this guy! Great seller 100% trustworthy!!

tablet|The following is a reflection of how I use my Nexus 7. I'm not a gamer, so I don't have too much of a problem with games coming to Android second. I don't need all of the latest apps, and I have a set of specific things that I generally do, all of which I have apps for, so I haven't really felt the impact of the Android tablet app disparity. I understand that these things matter to lots of folks, so take what I say with a grain of salt and try to determine if I seem like the sort of user that you are.HAVING FUN:Like most folks, the bulk of my tablet usage is for leisure purposes--browsing the web, connecting to Facebook and Twitter, playing simple games, reading. The Nexus 7 does a great job at all of these things. The screen is beautiful, and it makes all of these tasks a pleasure.Tech journalists will pick on the Facebook app's "blown-up phone" experience, since there are no features taking advantage of the tablet's size, but in practical use, this doesn't really cause any problems. Could it be better and slicker by targeting larger screens? Sure. But it's something I would like if it was there, but never miss when it's not.There are a few really good Twitter (and App.net, if you go that way) apps. My two favorites are Carbon and Falcon Pro. Be warned, however, that Falcon is already having problems with Twitter's user token limit (totally on Twitter's side, but still), and once Carbon adds some more features and corrects some bugs, it will likely reach its limit quickly, as well. The advantage that iOS has here is that it had a number of quality Twitter apps prior to the Twitter usage changes, which ultimately gave those apps a much higher user limit than a client just starting out. The two Android apps I've mentioned really do represent the best Twitter user experience on Android, and they are both young, which means their potential for a larger userbase is not there.There are a lot of great games on Android. Popular titles like Jetpack Joyride, Cut the Rope (and Pudding Monsters!!), Angry Birds--all here. I also play adventure and puzzle games, like Machinarium (sweet, sweet game) or Tiny Bang Story. Waking Mars, Swords and Sworcery--all here.Chrome is a great browser on any platform, and it really doesn't disappoint on the Nexus 7. Not a whole lot of new stuff to be said here.Reading with the Kindle app is fantastic. Reading with the Google Play Books app is less fantastic, but honestly, unless you're a die-hard googler, what are the chances that you've purchased a bunch of books from the Play Store?I also do a good bit of Bible reading on my device, and my top app for that is The Bible App from YouVersion. I have some qualms, and would much prefer if the ESV Bible App would be optimized for a tablet (and honestly, improved for Android overall).GETTING THINGS DONE:Here's where I was very unexpectedly surprised by the Nexus 7. I got it, like most people, expecting to use it for fun, and maybe some app development experiments. What I have found, on multiple occasions, is how useful this thing is as an assistant for getting things done.On the first day, we had a Bible study at our house. In preparation for that, I decided to try using the Nexus. I have the Bible app, after all, as well as Evernote and Google Docs.This past week, I was getting quotes for and scheduling a home inspection. I called with my phone, and took notes with the Nexus.In both of these instances, I was amazed at how easy the Nexus made it. There are two chief factors, as I see it, that make it so:1. Android multitasking. In Android, you always have a dedicated button onscreen (or on device) for multitasking. You tap it once, and you see a list of app thumbnails. Seeing those app thumbnails (instead of just icons) is a great brain-aid. Instead of having to recognize an app by its icon, you get to see what you were doing before you left the app. Also, only needing to tap once makes it a cinch to very quickly get to the list, and, in the case of the Nexus 7, since the multitasking button is software, onscreen, it can't wear out like a hardware button. So if you wore out the home button on your i-device (which I did on two iPhones), this might actually be a huge factor for you.2. Android 4.2+. Android 4.2 introduced swipe-typing to the built-in keyboard. This is a massive help. While calling home inspectors, I had my phone in my left hand, my tablet on my lap, and my right hand pointer finger typing up a storm using the swipe typing. If you aren't familiar with the concept, you put your finger down and move it to the letters of your desired word, only lifting when you want to end a word. It is ridiculously useful, and very forgiving. I don't have to aim for amazing precision, because it does a fantastic job of interpreting what you're trying to do. I also used the swiping to take notes in church this past Sunday, and I was able to jot stuff down quickly and get back to listening.SUMMARY:The wisdom of the tech journalists seems to be that smaller tablets are meant to be great consumption devices, whereas larger tablets and "real computers" are better for getting stuff done. The Nexus 7 is great for consumption, but it's most pleasant surprise is how great it is for accomplishing real things. It's definitely worth a look. You might just end up loving it like I do.

tablet|Very nice and reliable equipment it's covered so far all the expectations I had with it ! I personally recommend it
---
tablet|But it would have been much better if the product shipped with instructions and/or a user manual! On the other hand, it is far cheaper than overrated Ipad
---
tablet|I choose this over the Fire HD, because it's a Nexus! Google updates and Google support. Plus it has a Quad Core Processor! The USB OTG support is also huge plus.It's Super Genuine,It's Super Fast,It's Super Affordable,
---
tablet|This is the perfect 7-inch tablet. The OS is so smooth, the screen is amazingly sharp, and the processor is lightning fast. Having dealt with iPad minis also, this tablet beats it in just about every category.Another thing I love about this tablet is the battery life. I can use it for two days without charging it if I manage it good. And this thing goes with me everywhere because it is the perfect size. It easily fonts into my back pocket.I would reccomend this to just about everyone! You should defenitely give this little guy a try!
---
tablet|I just grabbed one of these as my first tablet and I've got to say how impressed I am. Never did I think I would be completely able to put aside my laptop and do all the computing things I do on this device. The screen size is perfect, and its bright and crisp. The speed at which it functions is super fast. The battery lasts a very long time even with extensive use (3d games are a different story). The apps are all very functional, granted it does take a little digging and research to find all the good ones. Overall, very, very impressed and definitely happy to have made this purchase. As a medical student I am doing all my studying on it now and this fits in my white coat perfectly to use as a reference while on the floor.
---
tablet|Awesome Tablet for the price.- Fast and responsive screen- Android Market- Customization screen- Fast WiFi- Decent CameraQuality is pretty good for the price and the feeling on the back is just awesome.Recommend to get a case because this is pretty fragile if you accidentally dropped it on hard surface.
---
tablet|I have owned many android tablets as well as the ipad3. This is the best user experience I have had on a tablet. Perfect size and form factor! Storage space is not an issue as I have rooted my tablet and use the Stickmount app with a $4 otg cable to connect micro sd cards and usb flash drives. The tablet reads and plays all files from the sd cards and flash drives without any glitches. I have hooked up many 32GB flash drives and micro sd cards and all work seamlessly! No need to store media directly on the tablet! For my pics I use picasa with the Pic Folio app. The battery life is superb! Klipsch s4 for android headphones work extremely well with the unit. Flash content not a problem with Firefox browser but Chrome gives a much overall better experience even though it does not support flash. The display is awesome even in outdoor lighting (unlike the samsung tab!). Other reviewers claiming screen issues...all I can say is you must have received a bad unit! I would highly recommend this tablet!!
---
tablet|The Google Nexus 7 is compatible with all the Google apps I love as well as many other apps I love. I have been very happy with battery life, as well. The screen is nice and bright and works great to adjust for reading things as well. I am very pleased with my purchase!
---
tablet|I bought this tablet from google play and NOT from amazon (I sort of understand them not wanting to have direct competitors products of course) and am very satisfied I purchased this over the kindle fire. The only issue I've had is with the google wallet app and occasionally youtube, but not enough to warrant a lower star rating because of it. Asus and Google have really outdone themselves. Screen looks great, no hang ups running almost any apps, and google play store has vastly improved as far as the quality of the apps go. Very intuitive and user friendly as far as Jelly Bean operating system goes. Battery life is pretty much as advertised, which is amazing for a electronic device of the past three years. I recommend this tablet or the samsung galaxy to anyone looking to get into an android tablet!

tablet|I am very happy with my Google Nexus 7 tablet, is better than expected, Google has accustomed us to good products.
---
tablet|I absolutely love my Nexus 7... I hate the fact that I have to keep in it in a loose-fitting sleeve and sift through a slew of potentially crappy third-party cases in order to protect my N7.How can Google and Asus release a product and offer only ONE SINGLE ACCESSORY?!Judging by professional reviews, the official Asus case leaves alot to be desired with it's weak, floppy front flap. With all of the time spent on developing this product, one would think that they would have had the time to make and release decent accessories along with it.We all know that there will be a dock and a premium cover coming out (details on them were leaked at the end of July) but with how many other products do you have to wait AT LEAST 3 months to have official accessories for??I'd give this awesome and affordable tablet itself 5 stars but this issue of accessories does affect the ownership experience of the product and it is something that needs to be noted by potential buyers and Google/Asus.On a sidenote, I think it is hilarious that Amazon jacks up the price of the Nexus 7 on their site when you can clearly get it for $25 less ANYWHERE ELSE. I hope this strategy doesn't actually influence people to buy a Kindle over a Nexus 7.
---
tablet|This is by far one of the best products you can buy for a bargain price.I have held out for a 7 inch tablet because I didn't think it made sense to carry around anything that can't be put in my pocket and still only be a consumption device.The Nexus 7 is a perfect fit.Does not get four Stars due to the lack of outward facing camera and no way to expand memory. But if you're not an avid gamer or deem it necessary to store all your movies on you small device, that doesn't really matter.The Nexus 7 has replaced my laptop except for a few tasks.
---
tablet|Since I have picked up mine (about 5 days ago now) I have had nothing but the smoothest user experience with the Nexus 7. Project Butter has worked wonders for Android 4.1! Getting from Page to Page of apps is such a smooth process now! Installing widgets has never been easier! The battery life is amazing as well. I played Majesty for about 4 hours the other night and my battery wasn't even down to fifty percent. The portability of a 7-inch tablet is amazing as well. It fits in my coat pocket easily enough. And the power of the CPU/GPU is great. Tegra 3 has my vote. As an e-reader it works great with the Marvel and DC comics apps.

tablet|I'm Google centric. My domain is at Google via Google domain apps. E-mail, calendar, tasks, documents, and web site are Google.Amazon is my vendor of choice for shopping via Amazon Prime, movies through Amazon Prime, Kindle books and audio books through Audible.com (an Amazon-owned company).If you want a tablet to read books, watch movies, listen to books and shop at Amazon, Kindle Fire is the tablet. Yes, you can web browse and do a host of other things, but the focus of the tablet is Amazon. 5 stars.If you are Google centric, Nexus 7 is the way to go.Brief comments on the Nexus 7:1. Fast.2. Android based. If you have an Android phone, there is no significant learning curve.3. Works with Google Domain apps - enter your e-mail address and password and you're up and your contacts, calendar, bookmarks,etc are sync'd.Annoyances1. The 3.5mm plug (speaker plug) needs a wasp-shaped or narrow body for the stinger. Your headphones and computer speakers will work, but your stereo cable may need to be changed out.2. Home page is always in portrait mode. When you start using the Nexus 7, every screen is portrait. All you have to do is pull down the "window shade" and touch the icon next to the time and date, and the orientation unlocks from portrait only to orientation except for the home screen. If you want the home screen to rotate, you can get an app.Never mentionedThe speakers are somewhat better than the Kindle.In summary, if you are an Amazon person, go Kindle Fire. If you are a Google person and are willing to forgo movies, Nexus 7 will be your choice.

tablet|I really love this tablet. Its responsive and quick, the UI is far superior to tablets of old. Google Play (Android Market) has also come a very long way. Its fun to go into the Apps section to browse the apps. The screen resolution is excellent and I watch movies on it all the time. I didnt have time to watch True Blood on TV so I loaded it onto my tablet and watched it while I was out running errands and appointments. Google Play offers tons of movies and Netflix works great!! My Android phone provides me with a FREE WiFI Hotspot so Im online when I need to be. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!

tablet|What is there to say?Zippycomfortable to holdgreat screenI think people are too busy nitpicking on things just to complain, I get it, that is what the net does, it allows people to complain behind a computer screen. But i really enjoy this tablet for what it does..I surf the net and the Tegra 3 does it efficiently, I read my books and the screen is lit perfectly, I wanted something comfortable to hold and it does that pretty good too.Buy with confidence.
---
tablet|I have used many tablets, the Nexus is the best of them all. Easy to use, great resolution, and many apps to choose from.
---
tablet|This is my first tablet, and just love it to bits! I guess everybody else had shared my sentiments already but all I can say is this device is most reliable and caters to my needs well. I now use this device more than my iPhone 4 and has never failed me. Clearly my best electronic purchase to date!
---
tablet|Was a big ASUS fan, motherboards, laptops, video cards so was really looking forward to this tablet. Worked very well for 30 days, then the touch screen started to become unresponsive. Found that if I turned it off and back on it would work again for a while. Now it does it constantly making the tablet unusable. Looked online and discovered this is a common problem with no fix other than RMA. Contacted ASUS directly for an RMA, been over a week with no response. I expected much more from ASUS, I will no longer be using ASUS products.

tablet|I've owned or worked with 4 different 7" Android OS tablets. When choosing a tablet it's all about what you will use it for. I like the Acer Iconia A110 the most because it has the most "utility". It's sort of the jack of all trades of these devices. It may not do anything the best but it can do the most. I hope that makes sense. I hope my review will help you choose your tablet. Here's the comparisonsAcer Iconia A110 - $199Pros - GPS, HDMI Out, Micro SD card slot, Google PlayCons - Screen Resolution 1024 x 600, Speed is just a tad bit slower than the others,the device is physically thicker and more bulky than the others.Notes: This would be a 5 star product if it had a better screen. Only 8GB internal storage without adding a micro SD card. I am able to stream amazon flash based videos by downloading a different browser than the stock chrome. This device runs Android OS 4.1 (Jelly Bean)Kindle Fire HD - $199Pros - Performance Speed, HDMI Out, Amazon Instant Video, Screen Resolution 1280 x 800Cons - No GPS, No Micro SD Card Slot, No Android Market/Google Play (Amazon Market only by default), Have to purchase wall charger separately, Layout isn't the standard Android OS GUI. Amazon has created their own UI.Notes: Excellent product but the lack of GPS and micro sd card slot is disappointing. The amazon based apps (kindle books & video etc..) have a wonderful UI in comparison to the other 3 devices. 16GB internal storage for the same price as the others is better value. This device is very "sleek" This device runs Android OS 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) under the Amazon Kindle GUI.Google Nexus 7 - $199Pros - Performance Speed, GPS, Screen Resolution 1280 x 800, Google PlayCons - No Micro SD card Slot No HDMI OutNotes: Great product would easily be the best unit if they added HDMI out and a micro sd card slot. This device has 16GBs of storage like the Kindle Fire HD. This devices runs Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) by default.Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 - $199Pros - Performance Speed, GPS, Micro SD Card Slot, Google PlayCons - Screen Resolution 1024 x 600, No HDMI Out (they make a hdmi out adapter for the other galaxy tab/note models but not for the 7").Notes: Only 8GBs of internal storage like the Acer Iconia A110. This device runs Android OS 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) by default.

tablet|we were very excited to get this product. Worked great, user friendly. The screen broke (easily). Google will not handle any claims for this product. Asus doesn't cover screen repair under warranty. The charge to get it repaired is $205. After researching the problem I came across many emails complaining about the screen breaking without even dropping the tablet. I would avoid buying this product.

tablet|Infuriating defect in the jack for headphones and earbuds. I tried two different ear buds with skinny plugs, plus my favorite AudioTechnica headphones. None of these plugs would insert far enough; I only got one channel of sound instead of two.Warning for Linux PC users: The Android USB software interface makes it difficult to copy audio files from a Linux PC via USB cable. Android conceals, from view by my Ubuntu PC, the "Music" folder where audio files are supposed to go. I had to copy audio files into the "DCIM" folder, and then, on the tablet with a Terminal app, I used a Bash shell command (mv *ogg ../Music) to move my .ogg music files from /DCIM into /Music. This problem does not exist when connecting by USB to Windows 7. From Windows a user can see the /Music folder and copy audio files into it.-----------------I notice replies, here and elsewhere, saying the audio starts working if you push extremely hard on the plug until you hear a snap. I tried this, many times, with no luck. I heard a snap but still just one channel of sound. I am returning the device and will report back on whether audio works on the replacement unit.-----------------Received a replacement unit, late November 2012. On this new one, the audio plug works fine, for earbuds as well as the high-end headphones. So the issue was a defective plug. Unfortunately, there are so many online comments about the plug/1-channel-audio problem that many customers evidently received units with this defect. Buyer beware, check the audio plug to be sure you hear both channels, as soon as you get the tablet so you can return it for a replacement. Upgrading to 3 stars. The unit's display is good, its virtual keyboard works well, and the apps run quickly.Important note for Amazon fans who would like to watch Amazon's Flash videos: The latest Android version of Google Chrome cannot run Flash. But this is solvable. Following instructions in online forums, I installed Flash, then installed both Opera and Firefox Beta. Firefox Beta worked better than Opera. So far Flash is working in Firefox Beta.

tablet|The Google Nexus 7 is a great tablet. The size and the feel in your hands are great. I really like the material they use on the back of the tablet. The interface is nice, graphic is crisp, easy to use, fast, and it seems to be flawless for the price of $246 + tax from Sam's Club. However, I am planning to return it due to few things that is not going to work for me.For some odd reason, the Nexus 7 does not have a native camera app (at least I was unable to find one). Since I can download a free app from google play, that's no problem.It only has a front face camera which I realized that would not work for me because I do not use the tablet to take my own photo or talk on Skype type of apps.The main reason I plan to return this tablet is because I use my iPhone & iPad2 a lot to stream videos from a certain website using the browser and I was planning to use the Nexus 7 for the same reason. I am not sure why but the Nexus 7 kept saying I need a plugin to watch it. I knew the Nexus 7 does not support flash and neither does my iPad2/iPhone. But I can watch it from my iDevices. I googled how to get flash on the Nexus 7 and after installing it, I was able to stream the video from the firefox browser. BUT, it will freeze and would not let me watch the video. Maybe I am doing something wrong.. I don't know.Oh, another problem with this tablet is the new android jellybean OS. I guess at this point it is too new that there are a lot of apps I want that are not compatible with the Nexus 7. Software should eventually catch up to the new OS, I would think.I played with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 at Costco (it's on sale for $219). This one has both cameras and a memory card expansion slot which looked good to me. Did not have internet connection to check on the video streaming I had problem with the Nexus7, but I prefer the interface and the feel of the actual tablet on the Nexus7 than the Galaxy Tab.Since price is not the main concern for me, I might wait for the rumored iPad Mini or the Kindle Fire 2 and check them out. The Nexus7 is such an great tablet... just not for me.

tablet|I won't bother to deny that I did not buy my Nexus 7 from Amazon. Why? The cheapest offer was some $52 above what Google was asking. So sorry Amazon, though I remain a loyal customer this was one case were you couldn't offer me substantial savings.I really like the nexus. Its construction is solid and feels so in your hands. But don't make the mistake of thinking this is a tank like one customer assumed buy carrying it around in his front pocket which given is size seemed strange to me and stressful on the unit.It's made for gaming due to the 4 quad processors and believe me this thing rocks on games. The screen resolution is superb as well. A superior book reader with the ability to grab books and book apps from across the net so you are not limited to one vendor. This is great news where as you can save $10 on books in many instances. This is what I expect in a reader. Competitive marketing. Thought the best ebook offerings are shared by only a few companies so far...it's an ever expanding market place.I'm not tech savvy when it comes to mobile devices. I don't care to be overly informed about it either. I have certain minimal expectations when it comes to a tablet or smart phone and the Nexus 7 far exceeds my minimal expectations and more than meets my needs.The added bonus of buying directly from Google for $199 plus shipping ($13 for 2 day delivery) is this..... they give you $25 credit at the app store where you will find every app you will need plus hundreds more. If a friend of yours has a cool app on his android device chances are you can also find it at googles app store no problem.So lets do the math real quick $199+$13= $212 now compare that to whats being asked for it on amazon. Now lets do some more math$212-$25 (credit)=$187 ! Wow........reality check anyone? :-)And for those who think that it doesn't support flash player well you can think again.Read item #23 [...] Also if you must have a home screen that rotates ( nexus 7 does not do this out of the box) there is a super app that will set that up for you easy and making a cup of water [...]I hopes this influences your decision to buy the Google Nexus 7 or worse yet not to buy it. Either way for the end cost of $187 from Google or if you can actually afford a few extra dollars to buy from amazon I feel that either price tag makes this unit an extremely good buy.Good Bye :-)

tablet|I wont bore you with the details just the baseline:1. apps are good from the free selection as I wont pay for an app as I am cheap2. I tried app for watching amazon prime on it...isn't compatible.3. FLash is no longer supported for Jellybean 4.14. If you have a google phone it will ninja synchronize all you contacts info and must be deactivated and was annoying.5. It comes Default portrait mode but you can get free apps to get it do go sideways blablaba6.It is FAST... I had a playbook and it responds / plays almost 2-3 x faster and you notice a difference with the quad core processor7. Waiting for Otterbox to make case...bought one from amazon for like 11-12$ and its not bad. Screen protector is optional too8. for the money its a good buy and as I am cheap I wont buy an apple.9. be warned with google and the privacy- go through all the settings to turn features on and off10. the Firefox beta browser is good as I dont trust chrome and privacy issues with itcheers!

tablet|This tablet was amazing when I first got it. Very fast! First, let me say that I am generally a huge Google fan. I use a Nexus 4 as my cell phone. The Nexus 7 is by far the biggest let down from Google ever. At first it would slow down to a crawl if filled up to less than 3GB of free space. I had to wait for the keyboard to catch up to me and it took up to 30 seconds for the browser to open. This was a common problem and was reported on many online forums. Deleting data and apps to free up more space did not fix the issue once it started. Only a factory reset returned the tablet to its former self. Google admitted to the issue in the forums and eventually released an update to fix it. Now the tablet runs pretty slow all the time, although not so slow that the keyboard can't keep up, but much slower than it used to go. Factory resets no longer speed it back up. I sent my original tablet back to Google and they sent me a new one with the exact same problem. They have not acknowledged the lack of speed again and sales are driven by reviews from when the device was first released and was actually fast. The tablet is usable, but my phone is so much faster and more portable that it makes my Nexus 7 almost useless. If you do buy one, do not upgrade past the original jelly bean.

tablet|The Google Nexus 7 has to be one of the best tablets out there. It is quick, it is responsive and not clunky at all. I had a chance to try reading from some other tablets, while trying to get to sleep. The others were so heavy, my arm nearly fell off. With Google Nexus, its lightweight allows me to read with minimum discomfort. The display too is brilliant. And, that is very important to me. Some might criticize it for lacking an extra camera. I have not even once used the one that it currently has. Tablets and cameras do not make sense in my view, as they all tend to be poor quality anyway. If I want to take a photo, I use a real camera, aim it properly and compose my shots.I will absolutely recommend this tablet to anyone seeking to make a purchase.

tablet|First I had an iPod Touch, then I got the iPad the first week they came out, sold both and got another iPod touch, sold that and got an iPad 2. Sold that and got the Nexus 7 and finally I have what I want. I walked away from 200 bucks worth of apps from Apple to switch to Android and I feel like I made the right move. So many more personalization choices. Finally freedom from iTunes! I can work with my desktop or my laptop to add and remove files. The back is textured so I can actually hold the thing. And finally, I have been a google user since the search engine was in early beta, and I have always felt good about the company, always felt like they were trying to empower me without impoverishing me...and this has that same feel. It's not as smooth and slick as an iPad, but it feels like technology I want to have around and can trust.
---
tablet|As expected from Google/ASUS, but they skimped on two essential hardware features that, to me, prevented this tablet from being perfect: a 5+ MP rear camera and a miniSD slot. All in all, it's awesome and a great purchase!

tablet|I purchased my 16GB fom Staples on December 21, 2012. Had I known about the product defect (which doesn't seem to occur with the 32GB) I wouldn't have purchased the 16GB. I was talked into it by the Staples "tech guy" who made it sound like I was getting a steal by getting the VERY LAST 16GB Nexus 7 instead of the 32GB. He also lied about the return policy and the warranty. But I digress. Within 9 days of use, the tablet took longer and longer periods of time to turn on. I began having to charge it more frequently because the battery stopped holding a decent charge. On January 15, it completely stopped turning on at all. Staples refused to take it back, citing a 12 day return policy (the tech guy told me it was 30 days due to Christmas) and the fact it was out of the box, AND because I did not purchase the $50 warranty, which apparently extends the exchange/return policy from 12 days to 365 days, they refused to exchange the defective product for something different, even if it would have cost me additional money.Now I am dealing with ASUS directly and I have not heard when I will get my "refurbished" Nexus 7 back and I still have to purchase something in it's place because I use it for my business. ASUS needs to RECALL this product to force the likes of Staples, Best Buy, and Office Depot to accept exchanges.

tablet|The Google Nexus 7 is an okay device when you consider the price. For a 199$ tablet, it definitely steps up, however, to compete with other Tegra 3 devices. My initial impressions upon getting it were positive, however the display could be brighter and I would have liked to see a higher pixel density for crisper text...but for 200 dollars it's great. I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this device because I read a lot of negative reviews about the build quality being bad and issues with the screen lifting from the bezel. I put the negative reviews aside and purchased it. The reviewers were definitely right when they said the screen lifts from the bezel, but the issue it not severe...at least not yet. Other than that the tablet it great, when it decides to turn on...I happened to see reviews AFTER I bought the tablet saying that they were having issues with the battery and getting the device to turn on and stay on. Well, I am definitely a victim to this issue because at this moment that I am writing this review my tablet wont turn on, the screen just flickers a very dark blue color. I have disconnected the battery cable and reconnected it and it did nothing. I have also tried holding the power and volume buttons for about 30 seconds to try to perform a reset and that didn't work either. At this moment I am thinking I will have to send it back and get a new one.You get what you pay for on this device. Really the only plus side to this tablet is that it is a nexus device so it will always have the latest version of Android running on it. Other than that I really can't recommend getting this tablet because of the issues I have been having with it. If you are in the market specifically for a smaller 7-8 inch tablet and don't care what OS is on it, I would recommend the iPad mini, kindle fire HD, Toshiba excite, or even a little bit larger sony xperia tablet s.So overall the specs are good but it is not reliable at all.

tablet|I got two Nexus 7 tablets - one from Google play store and one from a Brick and Mortar retailer. Not sure why Amazon doesn't carry it. The ones sold by third party merchants on Amazon are expensive.Coming to the tablet, the display is gorgeous, it feels very good on the hand and the UI and processor speeds are very snappy. The latest JellyBean Android OS takes the OS experience much further than iOS or previous Android UI. I love all the top Google apps - Google Now, Chrome browser, Youtube, Google Maps and Google voice. JellyBean OS and Google apps are two reasons I didnt even consider Fire tablets.Google play store is very good. It has tons of books - probably the largest collection of free books thanks to Google's digitization project of world's libraries. I use Youtube and Netflix app for most of my video needs and havent used Play store for video yet though I see a large number of good movies / tv shows available for rent or purchase.Google's cloud integration was incredible. I signed into my tablet and found that all my music from my smartphone available on Tablet automatically thanks to Google Music's cloud sync. When I pay them for the first time, it gets downloaded to the device. There is even an option to say which ones we want to store locally and which in cloud - great for managing space if you have large music collection.Overall most satisfied with the tablet. Best 200 dollars I spent on a gadget. I wish I bought the one with 3G connection and 32GB disk space.

tablet|Purchased for my grand daughter who is a sponge for learning and entertainment . So far , good product with ease of use

tablet|Purchased for my 11 year old for Christmas. He uses it mostly for reading, watching movies and googling things. He also loves the pocket edition of minecraft! After looking at what he really needed a tablet for, we decided on the Nexus instead of the iPad. He really likes the size and we loved the price. Some people have written about issues with landscape mode but we have not had any problems at all. The applications appropriately re-orientate themselves. Very happy with this purchase!

tablet|JUNK! Broke after 2 months have to return it now and try to get my money back......grrrrrrrrrr...so mad right now!!!Junk!!!!!
---
tablet|I RECEIVED IT LIKE 2 DAYS EARLIER THAN I WAS EXPECTED TO RECEIVE, VERY FAST DELIVERY, I'M VERY PLEASED AND HAPPY, THIS IS WHAT I EXPECTED TO HAVE, EVEN THOUGH THAT THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THAT I ORDER ONE, BECAUSE THE FIRST TIME, THEY LOST IT AT THE POST OFFICE, SO IT WAS NEVER DELIVERED TO MY HOUSE. AM NOT GOING TO LIE, BUT I WAS AFRAID TO ORDER IT AGAIN, BUT I'M GLAD I DID, THIS WAS MY BIRTHDAY GIFT. OVERALL, NICE RESOLUTION, EASY ACCESS TO THE WEB, FAST, THE PRICE WAS GREAT COMPARING TO OTHERS, SO I GUESS THAT'S IT. THANK YOU AGAIN!GREETINGS FROM A VERY HAPPY COSTUMER!

tablet|After a few months of satisfactory but uninspiring performance (poor touch sensitivity), the screen broke when in my pocket but under no pressure and not jostled. Google says talk to Asus. Asus says too bad, so sad, we don't warrant the poor screen. You can send it in and maybe get it back repaired for more than the unit costs. Defective design - not sufficiently robust for normal, modestly active use outside. Poor customer support. Zero is too high a rating.
---
tablet|i love this thing but make sure your really gonna use it because i love this tablet but realized i only use it for games when i wait at the doctors office or go on a road trip when i'm bored...hardly ever any other reason to use it since i prefer to use a desktop but it's great with alot of free games and things but there are some taht will charge you and nice screen size and great quality viewing for movies...they give you one for free to use which i belief is one of the iceage movies. requires a google account and coems with cahrger cord but i recommend getting a case to avoid dropping it or slipping as it is fairly large and a nice investment
---
tablet|I actually returned the tablet since I decided to buy the 10 inch tablet. Great service though! Thanks for fast shipment.
---
tablet|Purchased this tablet after reading several good reviewsHowever it has some major problems. It worked the firsttime I used it and has not worked since. It will not stayon and screen is frozenNow I have read this problem seems to be common
---
tablet|Performs as advertised. Very quick, very solid connections to internet. The functions are quite goodGood size. I did find learning how to use this product rather challengong. The only manual is online and rather tedious to use
---
tablet|The Nexus 7 is a fantastic portable tablet with a good looking display and pure Android experience. Asus has done a fantastic job with the build quality, you can throw this tablet around and not worry about it being scratched. It feels wonderful holding it, the weight distribution is spot on. The front facing camera isn't that great, but that's a very small complaint. I highly recommend this tablet for someone who is looking to not spend a lot of money yet have a powerful tablet.
---
tablet|When I am watching TV, I pull this out and play games, read email or listen to music. I love the google apps like google music. When I signed up for google wallet, Google gave me $25 to use in the play store, which I used to purchase touchdown for exchange so I can view corporate email any where. The only negative with my unit is that if your shut it down or it runs out of battery power, it takes a lot to get it back on - a lot of patience and a lucky touch. For that reason, I try to never let it be off.
---
tablet|The tablet came in perfect condition..and I was very satisfied with it..Great Tablet..I've tried friends tablets, and they weren't half as nice as this one.
---
tablet|Forget anything else out there, this is the only tablet anyone should ever consider. The 7 inch screen means it is extremely portable while still being full screened and sharp. The processor and graphics card plays games at console quality and supports everything from keyboards, mice, PS3 controllers and even more to control them with. Dedicated developers that have already made the tablet 100x better than it is initially along with many tweaks based on what the person wants from their Nexus 7. This is the ultimate tablet that just keeps on giving with the most updated patches for Android and a constantly expanding and improving app store that has everything one could never need.iPad 3? /laugh
---
tablet|I liked mine until it stopped turning on and off after two weeks of light use. Now it's just an expensive paperweight.
---
tablet|This tablet exceeded my expectations in terms of use and the endless possibilities. I only had 1 problem with the tablet I drop the tablet twice And uppn dropping it the second time the screen shattered and now is not usable, it could be a rare fluke incident because I thought it had gorilla glass but who knows I do intend to try and fix the tablet my self since besides the cracked screen it was a great experience.

tablet|Update: 11/16/2012My Nexus 7 device was repaired at a cost of $105 (after some talks with Asus).They replaced the broken screen and shipped it back free of charge. It took a while to get it back, but the repair was done well and device and screen are in new condition.I have been working with the device again during the past few days and there are no other issues. They did re-install the OS which I knew they probably would.I am upping my review to 4 starts, it is really 3.5 starts though because the device should be designed to withstand light drops.----I purchased this device 3 months ago from Google's site shortly after it launched.Overall this is a good product and fun to use. Jelly Bean has come a long way with responsiveness and user experience.However, there are several significant issues with the device:Issue #1: The glass is thin and it breaks with even the lightest of bumps. The device slid from my lap when sitting on a sofa down to the carpeted floor. You couldn't have guessed it - yes, the screen was cracked when I picked it up. To think how many times I have dropped iphones, ipads etc over the years, if they all cracked that easily then I would either have to spend thousands of dollars on replacements, or more likely stop using mobile devices altogether. I called Google Nexus support and described what happened in detail. Support rep was nice but said "it is an out of warranty issue". Sent me to Asus customer support. The service rep over there not nearly as nice but I explained what happened and that it should be taken care of under warranty because a mobile device should be designed to absorb light falls and bumps. I will update on this as I am sending the device to them for examination.Issue #2: Wifi wake up. I expected wifi to come on the moment I wake up the device. This is the case with all the mobile devices I have used in recent years. The Nexus 7 takes a good 5 - 10 second to start the Wifi when I wake it up. It's been an issue from day 1 and this happens every time I wake it up, so need to watch the wifi icon and wait a bit...Issue #3: Get's sluggish fairly quickly. We all remember the experience when using computes running Windows right? We restart the computer on average once a day and everything seems to be running pretty quick for a while, until the next restart is due. This device / os has the same issue. It trained me to restart it once a day at least to get good performance. This may get better with OS patches or upgrades.There are many other minor issues with this device / os but which device doesn't have them? I think the ones listed above really hurt the device so I wanted to point those out. Overall I would still buy the device considering it's low price to value ratio but would have liked to know the issues and especially the issue with its super fragile glass.
---
tablet|This tablet has exceeded my expectations ten fold. I wanted an ipad and got this because of the price,but I'm very happy I went this route. I wanted the ipad initially because I have a mac book, Iphone and several apple products but I got a good deal on the nexus. It is fast and customizable it also works well with my Mac for transfers. I'm delighted with the purchase. My brother was going to buy a Kindle fire and I had to tell him to rethink that decision.

tablet|The latest in the world of Tablet computers is the Google Nexus 7. With Apple iPad, Amazon Kindle Fire and many more already in the arena, Nexus is one more in the already crowded market. The 7 inch tablet has come up to positive reviews apart from a few concerns that need to be addressed. Critics have placed Nexus 7 between Apple iPad and Amazon Kindle Fire. Though it may not have the superior features of iPad it is better than Kindle Fire, therefore Google Nexus is not seen as a competitor to iPad. I find the screen resolution amazing and there is no doubt that the tablet is here to stay. Battery life is amazing, promising 8 hours. Nexus 7 comes with preloaded apps like Gmail, Chrome, Google+ and YouTube. Apart from this, users are given access to Google Play. I find it a convenient e-reader.
---
tablet|Im not going to rave about this, but I preordered it, hoping it would live up to its hype - If does, and more. Fast, sleek, amazing video, audio, touch screen, and for the price nothing comes close. Easily as useful and as responsive as an Ipad, but far more portable and less than half the price.You wont regret buying this!
---
tablet|First let me just say...do not let these companies rip you off! This is only $249 straight fom google and is in stock.[...]I bought mine from the play store and got Transformers: Dark of The Moon and a $25 credit in the play store. I take it everywhere...I have not put it down. Very well built inside and out.Do not hesitate to buy this...just get it from Google (recommended) or a local store like Sams Club or Staples.
---
tablet|Absolutely love it.Tablet is super fast and responsive. No lags of any kind.Screen is bright enough to use it outside without problems.So far, there are two cons I found on this:1.Power button is located near volume up/down keys, so it often happens that,instead of pressing the volume up I press the power button. It's really not a big thing,but can get annoying.2. This one I really miss: no possibility to connect it to you TV - in any way. That is a MAJOR con for me.So,you have no HDMI, but also no support for MHL adapters.Miracast wireless display technology also is not supported,so you have absolutely no way of connecting this thing to your TV.Anyway: good value for the money.
---
tablet|I bought this unit because CNET rated it the "Best Bang for the Buck". [...]I would recommend that you get the 32gb model for greater flexibility. Otherwise I agree with CNET 100%.
---
tablet|A great tablet to read books and has features that I like.As for the shipper would give them a 5 star!! (Good Job!)
---
tablet|I was debating between this and a Kindle Fire. I am glad we went with this. We are google users, so it was super easy to sync all of our stuff up. Would highly recommend!
---
tablet|This is a great tablet, for the best price. I guess everyone need to have one of them, i recommend it!
---
tablet|So Far so good. I like the battery life and the Wi/Fi range I get. I miss a removable SD card slot though.

tablet|It is good deal. It is very powerful and comfortable tablet. i am happy for buying this stuff and using now.

tablet|Love this tablet!Great performance, stylish look, works beautiful, HD VIDEO, and all of those pretty things.Recommend this to anyone, it's the best tablet out there with an unmatchable price.
---
tablet|Easy to set up, cheaper than an iPad, same screen resolution as an iPad, only con is no sd card slot. Also really zippy and fast around apps
---
tablet|This Nexus tablet was much better than I expected. It exceeded all of my expectations. Wonderful substitute for those that don't want to spend an arm and a leg for the IPad. It's heavier than it looks. Great if you are looking for something that you don't have to shell out a lot of money for accessories just to enjoy the experience. Media content isn't as lacking as some would say. Easy to use. High quality graphics. Wonderful Product!Side Note: I purchased this for my husband and this is his review of the Nexus 7 Tablet. Hope this review was helpful and thank you for taking the time to read it.
---
tablet|Highly recommended, and easily the best tablet on the market at any price, including the vastly overrated iPad. The 7 inch form factor is great for travel. A very fast processor coupled with Android Jelly Bean results in a very pleasant computer experience. Android OS allows for much more flexibility in how use the tablet, and comes the closest to being an actual computer. With more and more apps coming on line every day, Android tablets have a bright future ahead of them. Can hardly wait for them to come up with a larger size in the 9-10 inch range.

tablet|Mobility is key!! you can carry it around with you wherever you go without adding any bulk to your bag. No worries about low battery life; Nexus 7 runs for over 9 hours during HD video playback, 10 hours when web browsing or e-reading and up to 300 hours when in stand-by mode.Some of my favorite feature are:* Easy to use drag-and-drop controls.* Plethora of customizable options* Kick a!$ widgets* Web pages load quickly* game play smooth and responsive* multiple apps run seamlessly.* 10-finger multi-touch support*****Down fallThe Google Nexus 7 does NOT support WPA/WPA2 Enterprise WiFi, used in many colleges, universities, schools and some business. If you are planning to connect this device to a school, college or university WiFi check the type of network at you institution beforehand.
---
tablet|This is really a great tablet. It is fast, responsive, intuitive and easy to use. Unfortunatley, mine is defective in that it will not power up in low light situations. Will take it back. Hope they can fix these light sensor problems which have arisen, because this is otherwise a high quality piece of electronics at a very good price. One other thing: I would like to have seen a dictionary function for the books in "My Library", where touching a word shows its meaning. Does anyone know if there is one? (It is available on the Kindle app for this device.) And one more thing: the Amazon app is not available for this tablet. A little small-minded?
---
tablet|I have an IBM laptop, and an iPad2 but wanted something smaller and lighter for reading in bed. I bought the Nexus for that purpose. After a day and a half I gave up and sent it back for a refund, it is just complicated. Couldn't actually download a book to the nexus. Had to go to the cloud to read it. What a joke. Can't read a book without Wi-Fi. Tried to call customer service but they only have email, no phone support. Forget it. I bought an iPad mini and GREAT! No problem at all. I would NOT RECOMMEND the Nexus unless you desire frustration and pain!
---
tablet|I compared the Nexus 7 to other tablets in the same price category and choose it over the Samsung Galaxy 2 as my entry into the tablet world. After using it for 3 days I was liking everything about it with one exception: connectivity problems. I initially thought it was because of a weak signal from the WiFi network in our condo in a high rise tower along the Gulf Coast of Florida; however, after taking it to a new McDonald's down the street I experienced similar problems. I traded it for a Galaxy 2 the next day (same price) and found the improvement in connectivity to be significant. While there were many things I liked about the Nexus 7, and would recommend it in every other way, I wanted to alert others who might be considering this product of the potential for connectivity problemsGoogle Nexus 7 Tablet (16 GB).

tablet|I'm one of countless people who've had their screens crack for no apparent reason. Mine cracked in a book bag being transported from point a to point b. Many others report theirs cracking just sitting on a table. Some crack under normal use, such as hitting the power button.I loved mine until it cracked. But these aren't just fragile, they're built poorly and it appears just the strain of being held together is enough to break them. They should be recalled.I loved mine until the point that it broke, but it had issues from the beginning, including the case creeking and frequent crashes. But I could live with those. However only two months of use and its a paperweight. Asus has been very cagey about the issue and refuse to acknowledge that its an issue. Reading various threads on the subject, sometimes they fix it at no cost, but sometimes they blame the consumer and there doesn't seem to be any consistency. They must on some level realize its a flaw in the design or none would be getting fixed.Costs to fix appear to range from $140 to $205. In some places there have been reports that you have to pay for them to look at it. I did not experience that. I RMAd mine last week and don't know if it will be covered or not yet.This is clearly a "don't buy". It appears to be a case of when, not if. Mine cracked after two months but I've seen people report the cracking problem days after getting it. This along with the screen lift issue and the creeking case issue leads me to believe they are fundamentally poorly made.

tablet|Purchased this device for my mother-in-law for Christmas. Out of the box, it will not hold a charge and shuts down (even when plugged in). Contact Google and send it back in for an exchange (received UPS confirmation that Googel received unit back). Several weeks go by, Google now refuses to send a new unit unless I first purchase a new one and promises to credit my account once they examine the old unit - but can't give me any time frame when that will happen. I refuse to do this and ask for a refund. They refuse to do this b/c it's beyond the 15 day window. So, they have my old unit, refuse to refund and refuse to send me a new unit.Oh, and then there's the emails I've received from Google before I decided to call them. Here's this gem:"I understand that you have sent the device back in. I sent the information of the process to show you how it works. Upon your action which was not followed by the procedure."So they're evil and morons. Great. I'm out $200. I guess there is no honor among thieves.

tablet|IT DOES'N WORK, I CAN'T TURN IT ON. I NEED TO TURN THIS PRODCUT BACK IT BACK.I DON'N KNOW WHAT TO DO.

tablet|Purchased as a gift. I personally have not used it, but I can tell you the receiver says it is the best gift he has ever received. Everything about it matched or exceeded all expectations.
---
tablet|I bought this for my bf for Christmas and it is his new best friend! He absolutely loves his new toy. It's a step up from my Kindle Fire and his very own. Everything about it is great! So worth the extra money spent on Amazon for it. Thank You!

tablet|I ordered the nexus 7 online from the google shop but actually found it cheaper from a store. I bought the one from the store and returned the other with no issues what so ever and got my full refund back as well. My siblings and I pitched in got this as a gift for our mother and obviously I play with it everyday, I sure am going to miss this device when I have to give it to her on christmas day :(. We was torn between the kindle fire and this, and my fiance, who is a very smart person when it comes to computers and such related devices, said this would be better for her, and I agree. It's user friendly, small, and better than the ipads. I've played with ipads before and didn't get it, my fiance has a toshiba thrive and other related devices, and I find the nexus to be not as complicated.She doesn't have access to any internet, and she would only use it for games mostly anyway, and I put a ton of games on there that can be played without the internet. I know she is going to love it, and will have fun playing it. The one thing I don't like, which doesn't have anything to do with the device, is when I shop for games to install, that it would mention in the description whether if the games can be played offline or not, until then I will just have install games turn off the wifi and see if they play.Would I recommend this device to other people? definitely....I find it better than the ipads, more user friendly and it's a reasonable price.I have had it for a month, and have not had any external issues with it, or any internal issues.

tablet|Purchased the 16GB Nexus 7 today. Brought it home, step 1 selected English as my language, step 2 selected my home wireless network (which works great for 3 PCs and a printer) and the N7 was displaying the full signal bars. Entered my pass phrase and it said it was "connecting". Nothing happened beyond this for a minute or so until something in the N7 timed out and the screen went black. Woke the N7 up and it now showed "disconnected".Called Google tech support after about an hour of repeated tries of everything I could think of and getting nowhere with the WiFi connection attempts. The Google tech support wizard said to return the unit to the store and offered NO HELP WHATSOEVER, not even wild SWAGs or stabs in the dark. I'd heard Google tech support was useless but I guess I had to find out for myself - and I concur with the popular opinion. Gotta start listening to the other Amazon reviewers' comments.Did a whole lot of internet research to see if others had been having the same problem and if there was an iron-clad remedy. Yup, others had the same problem and no, no common fix floated to the surface.Called the store where the N7 was purchased and they just said bring it back. No offer of any help from their tech support department either. So I did take it back. Bye bye N7. Seems no one is really interested in supporting this device.If there is any good news in all of this, the local store where I purchased the N7 has a 15 day no questions return policy so I didn't have the hassle other reviewers had with returns to Google.11-15-2012 Update - No longer "bummed out"After more internet research and thought I decided to give the N7 another try so I purchased another and started playing around with the WRT54G wireless router. After a couple of hours and getting nowhere with setting changes, etc. (keep in mind the WRT54G router works great with all my other wireless laptops, printer, etc.) I purchased a Linksys E1500 wireless router. Went through the setup A-OK, fired up the N7 which found the signal right away and connected perfectly. Problem solved.I've since had a blast playing with the new N7.One problem, which appears not to be an isolated problem, is signal reception drops as the N7 is moved further away from the router. I guess I can live with that, but it will limit my use in some places where I'd hoped to use it.A couple of other comments on the Android OS (not the N7):1. Still trying to find a way to get my Firefox bookmarks from my PCs (in .html file) into the Chrome browser.2. Wish there was a way to add more groups to the People app.3. Found OfficeSuite Viewer (free) for viewing some of my Word and Excel docs. Works great! Not a substitute for MS Office, but I wouldn't try to work in Word or Excel on a 7" screen when I have laptops and a desktop where I won't get eyestrain.4. GasBuddy app - Great for finding reasonable (for these days anyway) gas prices in the area where the N7 is located.5. USA TV Droid - Great TV Guide app for those of us who get their HDTV OTA, especially now that Rovi is eliminating their TV Guide On Screen service :(One last comment, while Google Tech Support is for all practical purposes non-existent, I did receive a review comment from an Asus (makes the N7 for Google) tech support person without any solicitation on my part and a nice followup email from the Asus person with some helpful information. Asus cares!That's it for now. Still learning. I'll give the N7 four stars now, one star off for weak Wi-Fi signal reception.

tablet|Great design asus, and amazing job on jelly bean google. IS so fast , amazing display. I would recommend this tablet to anyone. Best 7 inch tablet in the market.

tablet|I'm very satisfied with nexus with your performance, dimensions and good video resolutions. Is nice to buy a "smart" cover to protect it.

tablet|I bought the Nexus 7 for my daughter who is a culinary arts student at the Virginia Culinary Institute after a virus disabled her computer for a time. This was a wonderful tool and enabled her to keep up with her classwork while she was restoring her hard drive on her home computer. Now she takes the Nexus 7 to school with her every day. She is able to store incredible amounts of data and produce lovely reports and pictures of food. She is very pleased with this product. Thanks Amazon!
---
tablet|I love this tablet. There are plenty of people that give more intelligent reviews for this, so I'm just going to go with I love this tablet. Works well, fast, comfortable to hold, easy to set up... there aren't any cons I've found so far.
---
tablet|Just a helpful reminder. It would not be in your best interest to purchase this product at $250 when the release of a 32gb Nexus 7 is just around the corner. The 16 gb is valued at Office depot for $200. Keep in mind, those are brand new and not "used items".
---
tablet|Instead I like it. Like a tool that bites you when your working on a piece of wood. The screen resolution is very good. No eye strain after an hour an hour or so of working on it. The processing speed is surprising and lives up to Google's promises. After having several Android phones and being disappointed in their jiffy speed this Nexus 7 is a joy to use. Agreeing with other reviews it's a crime to not have USB ports available. Blazes it's. 2012 right? Throw in a couple, crikey! I'm returning it, yeah really. The blasted tablet will not turn on after my last charge! I'm pissed because I really like the thing. The first recharge went fine but on the second one I had left it in for a good 8 hours and nothing just blackness staring back at me almost saying "sorry mate your're not going to get me to work again". This little tucker. I tried everything to start it up. What else besides pressing on the power button. I couldn't reset it, nowhere to reset from. So I called Google play store support and they were very helpful. I needed that because I was very frustrated at that point.I really wanted to love it. I will be getting another for sure...

tablet|This is the best tablet I have ever used hands down. It is jam packed with features. Jellybean, 4.1, really does polish Android based on what it was with Ice Cream Sandwich, 4.0. It is easily my favorite operating system. The pure Google experience is fantastic, whenever I use any other Android tablet or an iPad I think they completely suck compared to this. You can customize just about everything that you would ever want to with this OS and it is not complex at all so even if you aren't computer savvy you could find your way through this OS after a bit of use. I have three gripes about this tablet though. One of the most obvious is that there is no SD card slot, so no extra physical storage but you do have cloud storage such as Google Drive which I love. My second gripe, possibly the biggest one, is that it is pretty fragile. My first tablet broke 3 weeks into use. I dropped it three feet while it was charging and it landed a weird way and the USB port was bent and the chassis popped off a bit. I fixed the chassis no problem but the USB port was broken and unusable, making me unable to charge it. I do highly recommend getting a case and possibly a screen protector because it not Gorilla Glass. Another gripe is the fact that there is no back camera. If it did have one it would be so much easier for me to take pictures, not that it absolutely needs one. The front camera has poor quality but I really only use it for Facelock. It would be nice if the homescreen rotated too but nothing you can't live without. Lastly I love this product a LOT but I would highly recommend an extended warranty. Here is a quick list of things:PROS:-Nice feel in your hand, just the right size-Amazing display, lovely warm colors and bright-Operating system is a boss, made me an Android lover but specifically for Google's Nexus series-Pure Google, you can do almost anything and Google keeps growing, can be scary at times how much you can do-NFC, have used it a couple of times and I have to say its pretty cool-Google Now, made me extremely lazy and I talk to my tablet whenever possible-Fast processor, never experienced lag at all-Google Play, extremely convenient to get all your apps and I still haven't used the $25 you get for it-Youtube pause, pauses all music or other videos I have going when I start a youtube video or Play movie-Great speaker, it is actually nice to listen to and kinda loud when you want it to beCONS:-build quality could be better, no Gorilla Glass and you can get scuffs quite easily-home screen doesn't rotate, kind of annoying at times-No SD card slot, bye bye external storage-No back camera, so don't expect to use this for photography-front camera is not HD, so you probably won't want to use it to take pics of yourself-battery could be more powerful, I use my tablet 24/7 and have to recharge it everyday which can get annoying if it doesn't charge properly-USB cable in the box is kinda short, like 3-inches which is kinda short for me
---
tablet|Overall I am very satisfied with my Nexus 7. Its battery life is good for my needs; the screen is beautiful; the operating system is the best Android version I've used yet. I have a few minor issues, such as the touchscreen sometimes freezing up, but the issues I have are not deal breakers yet, and I suspect that Google will address any problems over time.I give it 4 stars for the minor issues but I have no plans to return it.
---
tablet|I've tried at least six 10.1 inch tablets and 3 7 inch tablets. Always on the search for 1.) The most stable 2.) The most fluid (no stuttering), 3.) The most feature packed.This is the tablet. No crashes, simple OS, you can add a "Skin" if you want more cosmetic features. My gripe with most tablets is that video playback was very choppy, and hard to maneuver around when going in and out of video mode. Not with this tablet. Simply perfect. As far as user experience, there are some pluses and minuses compared with other tablet, but you're simply not going to find an overall package as good as this.Some areas, that could be better.1. Sound is great, however, sound was better on the samsung 7' tab.2. Expandable storage. You'll learn to live without it though.3. The black bars on the top and bottom. Wish there was a way to minimize the screen real estate, but you forget about it after a while.Other than that...great tablet...get it.

tablet|I bought this tablet after never owning one before and I love the way android os works. It came faster than shipping said it would. (Bought it from Google sorry Amazon)I have had it since release. and bought the 16gb version. This tablet has runs great no hiccups, lags or reboots. It synced with my Google account in a flash and all my android stuff loaded with no issues. It's very durable however I don't recommend dropping it as the screen goes all the way to the edge. The screen is bright and the touch is very responsive. Sound is good and plays music well. Movies run great and look great. Runs Skype and Quick office excellent. Now for the bad.... no micro sd card slot??? Really all cell phones have one. It will not run flash (there is a work around if you look online) that really does not bother me as most web sites should move to html5 anyway (my opinion). And finally there is no light indicator for received messages or email grrrrrr. But it's a great tablet and am enjoying it!

tablet|There are four major issues with the Nexus 7: 1) The glass screen cracked much too easily - within of week of very careful use. They are not using high enough quality glass! 2) Repair was WAY too expensive - $160 for a $200 item!!!!! 3) Repair took WAY too long, about 6 weeks, rather than the promised 2. 4) The user-facing camera is of VERY LOW quality - tons of noise, low resolution. There is no rear-facing camera. FORGET ABOUT PICTURES!Google let Asus cut too many corners here. Not good for Google's reputation.
---
tablet|After a couple of months the screen kept flitting from one web site to another without any input from me. Finally it simply froze and could be used for nothing online. I chucked it out and bought an iPad Mini which is fabulous.
---
tablet|nice design. faster than my kindle fire. a bit expensive that the china brands.but. not bad at all. try it.
---
tablet|I couldn't wait to get the Nexus 7. Finally bought one at Staples, brought it home to discover it was dead as a doorknob. Returned it, no problem, in exchange for a new one. This time I turned it on in the store to make sure it was working. Used it for a half day, then suddenly ... dead. Charged for several hours, tried the 30-second power button hold suggestion. Tried the power-button-volume-down-plug-unplug drill too. To no avail. This one is going back and I'm not going to bother for the third. It's a shame because in the few hours that it lived it looked beautiful. But now I really can't trust this model.
---
tablet|Had this on my wishlist for a while. Truly worth the money and amazing for reading too. Would recommend it any day over any other 7inch tablet in the market. Money well spent!
---
tablet|Overall a good product. The interface is neat and all the apps work great. Youtube integration is quite nice.A nice product to have.
---
tablet|The Nexus 7 is a really useful gadget, when reading, game playing, video watching, video conferences and networking everything becomes easy and really accesible.The processor is really fast. The RAM is far more than enough. The screen is outrageous. Even the front camera is very good for taking photos, and the build construction is overall very good. The battery lasts as much as promised (Approximately 10 hours when used fully).The only bad detail is the compass. It tends to need recalibration from time to time. But it can be easily recalibrated.Highly recommended product

tablet|Great tablet, quick and responsive. Even though I have an IPASD, this one is cheaper and sometimes even faster. Recomend.

tablet|It is the best tablet that can exist in the market, it was my Christmas present and my wife does not stop using it. It has excellent performance and best of all its design is spectacular. I recommend it blindly.
---
tablet|Great product, great choices for apps - and since it's based on Android, what a future! The product arrived a day ahead of the projection too.
---
tablet|I have worked with several 7inch tablets and I find that Google really meets up to the standard a smart device. It is not flawless but most of the problems have simple workarounds. Still learning about the product.

tablet|nice tablet the best one ever .. Low price and good conditions .. Suitable size .. What we want more !!!
---
tablet|My new favorite toy! Fits nicely in one hand for reading, the OS is super fast, and it is quite durable as I've dropped it a few times without a case and it has survived.

tablet|Nexus 7 Tablet (16GB) It is my first tablet and I am really happy with this acquisition, Nexus7 is designed to go where ever I go. I also like android system because is so friendly and the battery of 8 hrs is very helpful, also for me than I'm over 50, download apps is so easy. The only issue I would like to have is a rear camara to take pictures.

tablet|Admittedly, it took a long time for me to buy a tablet, since I have my phone, desktops, laptops, Ipod Touches. I also contemplated buying the Ipad. I just couldn't see a use for it until I went on vacation. The idea of packing my laptop was my motivation in making this impulse buy. I thought about being on the plane and knowing my battery would last only part of the trip. So I bought this tablet. This tablet is the perfect size, as I can carry it in my purse. I feel comfortable using it like a PC to shop with, which is not easy to do on a phone. Its big enough to view and small enough to hold in one hand. I have loaded this tablet with a lot of apps, but I haven't put music or movies. I don't see the need to since I have cloud and streaming. As for this one not having 4g connectivity - yes theres an app for that! I use my cell phone's internet connection with the open garden app when I'm on the road and need to connect online!!! The only thing I really wish this tablet had was an HDMI connection to watch movies on my TV. I would also recommend that the power button be more accessible; either on the top or the bottom. That is really nitpicking because I'm able to do everything on this tablet between netflix, books, sirius, chrome, games, and customizing.
---
tablet|The reviews seem to like the device and I'm interested in buying one however there is still missing spec info. Namely, is there an HDMI (mini) port on either the Nexus or the Fire? I currently have a Coby Mid 7024 and love the fact that I can use it's HDMI port to connect it to my TV and stream YouTube and network news videos on demand. I don't see such a port in the limited specs or any mention in the reviews. And will it run the Netflix app? Or the SKYPE app? The latter is a must for me as that's how I make phone calls when I travel. I really don't want a device that's just a doofus 'media kiosk'.
---
tablet|I'm seriously looking at the Google Nexus 7 tablet as a replacement for my Motorola Xoom. I like what I've seen and read so far, but what puzzles me is that the original list price for the 16 GB is $249. Why is it $20 more on Amazon?Are there added features or accessories I'm not seeing in the product description?
---
tablet|This tablet is awesome! I now some people have had issues with the screen and stuff like that but i have been fine for the 4 months i have had it. I didn't need to do any magic tricks to get these issues not to show up(No one should have to). I'm not the 1 special person who does everything right. Lol. anyways i have been able to run all my favorite apps fine except Nova 3(Which requires overclocking to run smooth). To make this tablet cheaper they did have to make some sacrifices so i understand the lack of a few features. This tablets front facing camera if you want it sucks but can be used. The stock rom is amazing. There's very little need to go beyond stock with this tablet however i did root mine and install paranoid android to get a true tablet ui. I have been able to get external storage working on this tablet but that does require rooting and an otg cable. The Nexus 7 is very fast and has almost no bloatware at all. Emulators like n64oid and fpse run amazingly. Fpse works smoothly with opengl and games like ocarina of time, Perfect dark, and Goldeneye 007 work on N64oid. If you're new to android emulators run out of the box. No need to root. All in all for the price you can't get any better.

tablet|I've had the Nexus 7 for about a month now. I can say that it is performing without a glitch. I've got streaming radio (TuneIn), Skype, Audible, Kindle books and web surfing as my main activity. Instant Messaging (IMO), Dropbox also working well.I did have to install the Puffin browser to play some flash programs (Colbert and Daily Show) that I like. Puffin does ok, but has an odd thing that seems to be related to the Nexus 7 itself. The flash video will stop playing , and I can rotate the tablet (portrait/landscape) and it continues playing. I did this for a couple of hours, so I am sure that changing the orientation actually releases the flash from its frozen state. Weird. (I put this in comment back to Puffin and Google, so perhaps that will be improved some time)Another thing that happened was, due to the short USB charging cable, I picked it up, it pulled out of my hand and fell to the carpeted floor. The force twisted and bent the USB socket (enough that some of the back cover snaps came open). I was able to bend the USB port back and push the cover back in place and am still able to charge the unit (haven't tried data yet). Advice: buy a longer USB cable and be especially careful when plugged in and charging, even on carpeted floor. I don't think having it in a case would have helped. The extra weight may have made it worse.I intend to replace the internal daughter board so that the USB cable snaps more completely into the socket again, at some time. I called Google and Asus to buy the I/O assembly, but they would not sell me one. I found one on a third party site which is out of stock for now (wonder if that says something), so when I get the part I'll update this post.I can say that the device appears relatively easy to disassemble and replace a few parts (battery, speaker, I/O assembly, front screen, etc). Asus does not seem to want to support the parts to do so, though. Since the damage was my own negligence and not a manufacturing defect, I did not try to game the warranty. I'll take the hit and try to repair it myself.Note, Asus did say that by having it repaired in their center (starting estimate about $75 plus postage) it would restore the warranty. I almost went for that till I saw how the device can be opened up for this simple part change.Despite the attempted push by Asus to not support user repair, Google gets credit for building a device that can be repaired by someone of moderate competence. This will be especially appreciated when a battery needs replacement.Buying from Walmart seems to be a consideration when asking for warranty support. I would not have wanted to go to the store for support with a device like this. I was impatient when I saw the unit for sale, so did one of my rare non-Amazon purchases, this time, so it will be interesting if I have to get warranty repair some time. There is apparently different procedures depending on where you bought it when you are dealing with Google support.Amazon just does customer support right, so I'll stay with a sure thing next time.Bought a small portable Bluetooth keyboard as the on-screen keyboard is missing arrow keys (the text edit feature built in can move you around the text, but when the keyboard is on screen it limits the lines you can move around to). Logitech makes a nice one that has the arrow keys and a few other Android specific keys. It is just slightly longer than the Nexus 7. I can be pretty far away and it still connects. Now I can easily respond to e-mails and edit as I type.One note here is that I am getting pretty good voice transcription from the Nexus, so if I can just put a full thought together before I start speaking (not a Nexus problem), it will likely become my main method for creating text.I like that I can say "weather" and and it speaks the day's weather. Also "note to self" is convenient as is "Set alarm for 2 hours from now" and "Set alarm for 7AM". The alarm doesn't seem to do a voice based time set for more than 24 hours from now though. Works fine through keyboard process.You can also say "traffic" and it will bring up a local map with traffic info in the web browser.The Chrome web browser that comes with the unit has a couple things that help someone with older eyes (like me). If you double tap the screen it zooms in to the paragraph as best it can. Double tap again and it zooms out. Much better and works pretty consistently. Also, if you press more than one link it zooms in on the two links and lets you select the one you intended. Note, either way, if you press and hold the link it lets you open it in another Tab, so you can go through your news provider and open all the articles in other tabs, then go to them to read rather than going back and forth.Anyway, love the unit. I use the Amazon App center for my apps, though they can be a bit out of date for updates (seems like it is getting better). I didn't sign up for the Google Play app store (may some day since the two stores are slightly different...Google play lets you filter reviews by the Nexus 7 device and by the most recent app version).Can't wait to see the apps mature. I can see the device becoming my constant companion. My brain needs all the help it can get.Dave

tablet|I was planning on getting a 10" tablet, until I used my friends nexus 7. I was surprised how much I liked it. So instead of waiting I bought this tablet. Its an excellent tablet. It runs really smooth and snappy. It feels way better than any other tablet anywhere near its price. The build quality feels solid and durable. I really like the form factor, I used it all the time when I am home and half the time when I leave the house i take it with me. I have been using it for 2 months and its still in very good condition.
---
tablet|It's a very nice product, easy to use. Battery life is awesome and so is the quality of videos. Overall a wonderful productSome restrictions though1. Lack of a 3G connectivity option2. 7" is a somewhat small and less convenient for typing - only if Google can plan a 10" tablet that would be awesome.
---
tablet|I have 4, iOS devices, and 2, Kindle Fire/Android devices, and 5, Android devices. This is by far the best OS of all of them. Jelly Bean knocked out of the park. The Asus hardware is amazing at this price point, but very close to the Kindle Fire. I do very much like the KF ecosystem, and I am deeply invested in it, so I ordered the KF 8.9 inch for media use. I use the Nexus 7 for work mostly, and it is connected to our corporate email system. It works better than anything I have tried in this role.Enjoy!

tablet|ASUS Nexus 7 16gb tablet is a very fast, very bright, and very inexpensive android tablet. You get a vanilla operating system with no bloatware. The screen is super bright and does not get washed out very easily in direct sunlight. Text is crisp.Pros:-Very light to hold-Bright screen-Okay speaker-Fast CPU-Fast GPU, plays NBA 2K13 and Need for speed with no problem.-Inexpensive-WIFI reception is very strong-WIFI download speed is excellent-Battery life excellent-Solid buildCons:-Not rounding the sides make is somewhat uncomfortable to hold without a case-Idle button on side below the angle of the side hard to toggle without securing grasp of device-No SD card or expandable memory slot (but you know that going into the thing)-Only 7"-Plastic case (for price didn't expect molded aluminum like ipad mini)-Does not have the multi app function yet like the Samsung Notes-Some headphones don't fit right in the headphone jack for some reasonI have owned plenty of android devices and I say hands down this is a winner. I have been so used to the HP touchpad screen size I will have to upgrade to the Nexus 10. 7" screen size too small for me, however don't let the screen size take away from a great device.I have added a couple of pictures just to show you the size of this device.Bad thing is the free apps on google market have so many ads, some apps don't let you play without wifi connected. Also might not be best device for kids because you can click those ads and end up in the wrong place. If you link your credit card (don't do this) you can by mistake purchase items you didn't want (clicking on those adds).I recommend downloading the AMAZON App. You can get free apps from Amazon that do not have ads. Amazon also gives away 1 free paid version of an app a day.

tablet|I already have an iPad and I wanted a smaller tablet and one I could program for. Both goals were met b this tablet: it is smaller and lighter, so I can read kindle books easily with it. The Pad is bigger and it is not as convenient for ebooks, in my opinion.And as per the development of applications, the android OS makes it easy since it does not require a Mac.So here I am, reading kindle books and developing my programs for the tablet.

tablet|It all I expected about it. My daugther is so happy, she use a lot, plays games, and enjoy herself very much.

tablet|Needs to come with file manager. Does everything I need it for. Fast. Can easily be carried separate or in bag. All in one unit--word processor, reader, etc.
---
tablet|First off, I may be biased. I have owned an iPad2 and use a iPhone 4S. This tablet was attractive because of the smaller size, lower price point, and ability to finally try android.No complaints with app selection, weight or screen. I do prefer the feel of the metal iPad to the Nexus. My biggest complaint is battery life. If you dont put the tablet into airplane mode, it dies in 2 days on standby. All of the apps constantly update in the background and this is unavoidable. I have had slightly better results killing apps but it is still a frustrating process.Additionally, if you use Google Drive, there is no native integration with the app on the Nexus. This is surprising and a little frustrating - it would make a lot of sense for my movies and music on Drive to automatically be integrated with their respective apps on the Nexus
---
tablet|This tablet is a great buy for the money. Entry level tablet I guess. Has a beautiful display. Wish it had a HDMI output to hook up to TV. Also it has no SD card slot. Sound is my only real complaint. The speaker is just not load enough. It's ok with head phones however.
---
tablet|Does what i need it for.. internet, email, and a game here and there.. One small amount incident where bit shut off and wouldn't turn back on for a minute, other than that it has been good. Would recommend.

tablet|I bought Google nexus 7 in November (in Belgium from shop, not through Amazon). From the beginning the software had a bug, tablet freezed 3-4 times a day. After some weeks it did not load battery anymore. Had to be sent to manufacturer, waiting time 4 to 6 weeks. Great.My advice: today tablet PC and smartphone manufacturers want to push products to the market as soon as possible. Testing (and paying) is left to consumers. So when new product arrives to shops, wait some months so at least the worst bugs are fixed.And Concerning my tablet PC: My guess is that they fix the battery problem but do not track the software issue, and I am left with a handicapped product. Not happy.

tablet|FINAL EDIT & SUMMARY - October 27, 2012:I have been using the Nexus 7 for a few months. Overall, I am very happy with it. The 4 quad processor is very quick, the apps open and close instantly. There appears to be a good selection of apps for the Jelly Bean version of Android. I am still waiting for a version of the Amazon app that will work with this tablet. The device is made with high quality materials. Normally, I use screen protectors and a protective case for my mobile devices. I prefer to use the Nexus 7 uncovered. The synthetic material on the back of the tablet makes it easy to hold and it would be a shame to cover that beautiful screen. It appears to be a very sturdy tablet. My only quibble, the packaging was so tight, I had to rip a part the box to remove the Nexus 7. Good thing I like it, because returning the tablet without the original packaging would have been a major issue.I discovered the auto-rotate switch in the settings area. It controls the visual orientation of books and things displayed on the screen. It's default setting is "OFF". When set to "ON" the display will always be positioned properly whether the tablet is positioned for landscape or portrait viewing.I considered returning the Nexus 7 when Amazon introduced the new Kindle Fire HD, but after serious thought decided to keep the faster and more powerful Nexus 7. A few weeks ago, my lady friend purchased the 7 inch Kindle Fire HD. It does not feel as responsive as the Nexus 7. I am now a totally happy camper and raising the rating to 5 stars.

tablet|Although the product has a Google name, but it is made by Asus, and unless you purchase from Google directly, Asus is responsible for repair.Unfortunately, Nexus 7 is a fragile piece of hardware.My unit broke down after a little more than a month of light usage. I had to send my unit in for RMA. After a couple of weeks, I was wondering why my unit has not come back yet. I contacted Asus, and was told they were waiting for component, and no ETA date was available for my unit.I am still waiting for the repair to come back.Lesson learned, never buy any Nexus product, unless it comes from Google directly. And if you have to buy, avoid Asus as much as you can.

tablet|Something is wrong with the wifi on this google nexus. It will not download from internet, it shows a connection but takes 3 days to download a book from amazon. My tosheba Thrive downloaded the same book,same connection in 17 seconds.Would not downloads apps from google at all. returned it to amazon and bought a kindle fire hd. Very happy with it

tablet|So I bought my nexus on the day after Christmas last year for roughly $250 and it was a 32 GIGABYTE MODLE THAT IS DOUBLE THE MEMORY! YOU CAN GET THIS PRICE ON THE GOOGLE WEBSITE, but other than that it is an amazing tablet strongly recommend for the price on the Google website. This tablet can do anything you need it too!

tablet|I have my Nexus 7 tablet since November 2012, approximately 3 and half month to the date.The main reason I had chosen Nexus 7 was its capability of Japanese / English inputs.Jelly Bean 4.2.1 had very similar Japanese / English switch off keyboard to Apple products, however their newest OS (Jelly Bean 4.2.2) removed the Japanese keyboard option from their setting.Whoever being in charge of the newest OS left the existing "Emoji" as the replacement of google Japanese keyboard... Unbelievable. Emoji is not a language, it's a pictures!In the middle of discussing language input issues with google customer services, they recommended me to factory reset my Nexus 7 devises.I had backed up my devise and reset my Nexus 7 while the customer service walked me through the process, and I ended up losing all of my saved photos and musics (downloaded through an music app, not from google play)!!!I still think this devise is ok for web browsing etc., considering the price of other tablets, however it became an useless devises for Japanese language user, and the group of incompetent customer service agents made the matter even worse.I hope they restore the Japanese language input.

tablet|Thank you. This works great. I gave it as a gift. My daughter and grandaughter both try to use it at once.

tablet|From the day I received this product, I m getting used to it and enjoying the features provided. I am the Android user so didnt felt difficulty is adopting it. Overall the good product. value for money.
---
tablet|I received it fast and in great condidtion. I'm still checking thing out, but what I had done on it is great.

tablet|Bought this primarily as an education tool and an always on hand web browser for email. Not having any experience with a tablet PC unless you consider a smartphone one, I approached it as an actual computer and tested what i could do with it. The learnign curve is not too steep. The User interface was intuitive and with no prior experience with android after about 8 hours of use and research I found that i became proficient with the Android setup. I have not explored customization of user interface, rooting it etc at this time. I found that for normal use it worked pretty good. We found that we were regularly grabbing the tablet instead of starting the main pc or laptop. Web browsing is ok though the larger format tablets may be better as some sites are cut or to small to read. Apps for popular websites like reddit, cnn, etc helps a lot for readability. We have used it to watch movies after integrating it with tversity so we were able to stream most movies through the wireless as i would with an xbox360. Adult oriented games abound and we have become addicted to several. All things considered, for adults it worked pretty good.For kids its great. The small form (7") and how lightweight it is lets a two year old carry it with ease. I feel the overall construction is pretty durable. Though we have been careful, with kids you expect some drops. Its hit the floor a couple times with no problems. The kids education apps on PLAY store have already expanded my kids reading and math skills and they have only been using it for a couple weeks. We allow 30 minutes of education apps with 5 minutes of games like Angry birds and the kids beg to do their learning. I have noticed signifigant improvements in their at home education.One thing i didnt know is registering it with Google play store with a credit card gave me $25.00 credit to use. We installed approximately 20 different education apps, some better than others but all things considered it provided my kids with an excellent education games.All

tablet|By now you must have a ton of reviews and are wondering should I get this ? I was like you and believe me one word can describe my experience great!!!!!!!Who is this device for ? Everybody it's affordable does what it is supposed to do and more. So what do I like ? The size the response time with the screen the fact that being from a country other than the U.S. I get to buy apps and download games. Unlike the Kindle from Amazon who only serves us based customers for now .Kindle Fire an on the go tablet with region issues ok ...Anyway love it and recommend it to anyone.What i hate no back camera that sucks big time ... Well you can have everything in life. The fact that it did not rotate but just upgrade to jellybean 4.1.2 and make sure auto rotate is checked and you should be ok .
---
tablet|This tablet is amazing, it made me want to switch to a nexus phone next time around, it works flawlessly, runs buttery smooth, isn't clogged by branded launchers... it's perfect!!!

tablet|Nexus 7 has exceeded my expectations. I already own an iPad (1st gen) and wanted to try this out and also learn about how android works. Usability and navigation are at least as good as apple's touchscreen devices in my opinion. The processor is definitely fast and applications run smoothly. It is faster than my iPad. The major positive feeling I have with the device has to do with a general feeling of "openness" with respect to adding apps, books, movies, music on or off google's play (their version of itunes). I also think the seven inch screen size is perfect for reading or watching a video when traveling. Fact is that - at least to me - the iPad still seems a little ostentatious or due to the larger size, simply too visible. I live in a European city where people actually use public transportation. Nexus 7 is small enough to fit in the pockets of my suits or coats, so I am bringing it with me to far more places than my iPad. Web browsing on Chrome is perfectly fine and fast. Only thing missing is a 3 or 4 g connection possibility, but not too worried as there are plenty of hotspots these days. To sum up: For their asking price this is a hell of a bargain.
---
tablet|The Nexus 7 tablet embodies the moment when tablet buyers no longer have to compromise performance for price. No other 7-inch, $200 to $250 tablet combines this level of performance, with Android 4.1's features, in such a comfortable design.What buyers lose with the lack of built-in expandable storage options and the omission of a back camera, they'll gain in complete OS flexibility in a powerful and cheap tablet.
---
tablet|this nexus 7 is a wonderful product. i'm an international customer and google play don't support international customers as yet however, i can download free apps... i had a blackberry playbook, i've sod it and bought a next nexus 7 because its a wonderful product. minus the camera..its great
---
tablet|Simpleness, beaty and performance! These three words describes this device in the best way. I loved it from the first minutes. Perfect display and quality of materials. No bugs discovered yet.
---
tablet|Before I bought my Nexus 7 I owned an hp touchpad. The main reason I bought the nexus is for better app compatibility in the Google play store. I have used the amazon app store, and it does not compare. Having a true supported tablet is important to me, the kindles limitations are too much. The new hd model is an improvement, but it is not nearly as fast as the the tegra (my galaxy nexus has the same processor as the Kindle hd). Skip the Kindle and get a nexus, you won't regret it.
---
tablet|The overall experience is been great. The definition and resolution of the graphics, the good processing power and the user interface. I like this product very very much. I found only one small issue and is that there is no app preloaded for the front camera.Thank you
---
tablet|I bought this for my wife as she wanted a new table. I must say I was so impressed with it, I ended up buying one for myself. The size is purfect. It's big enough that you can read and play games on without any problems. The battery life is good, I can get a full days use watching movies, reading books, and playing games. The build quality is good. I would highly recommend this tablet if you want a 7" tablet.

tablet|I LOVE the product, its a shame that the service is so bad, I had never been so frustrated in my life. Since day 1 the screen had sensitivity problems and it would not react as well to touch. I did not send it back immediately because it was a Christmas gift for my kid and i didn't want to take it away. After month and a half it just got worst and the experience was not good. So I send it back to ASUS (I had to pay shipping and there is no refund), after a week on the 25th of Feb they send me an email saying i should receive it by the 28th, on the 28th of Feb we don't receive the tablet so i call FedEx and they say the process was initiated but ASUS never actually sent the tablet. I have been calling, email, and chating with ASUS since that day, they LOST my NEXUS and its the 15th of March and there is no solution, no refund and they keep saying my case was escalated and should be soled in 2 business days but its been 2 weeks. And even though its a Google branded product they don't care, if you did not buy it from them its your problem and ASUS's problem.When i had trouble with my iphone they sent me a phone while mine was being fixed, then they send my fixed phone back and once i receive it i can send their iphone back so that i am not without a phone a single day, plus they pay all the shippings.I wanted so bad to switch from apple to android but even if you buy a Google branded product there is no service if you have a problem.I guess the $100 difference between the Nexus 7 and an iPad mini are well worth their money, for starters its nos $75 difference since i had to pay $25 to ship it back to ASUS and i guess just having what you payed for in your hands and working is well worth the $75 extra.DO NOT BUY and if you buy just pray you dont have a problem with your Nexus

tablet|I will never again purchase from a third-party seller on Amazon.com . My experience has been a nightmare starting from receiving a defective product and trying to return it they charged a restocking fee and a lot of trouble it should've been resolved very quickly. Stay away from &#34;pioneer electronics &#34;!
---
tablet|I received the Nexus 7 today. After, setting it up as per instructions and charging the battery, it preformed very erratically...apps crashing...tablet rebooting...At some point I was informed there was a system update. I did the update. It still did the same thing. Finally, it quit working completely...wouldn't boot up ..just hung up in the reboot process. I did some research and did the hard reset. Nothing...except it now just sits there with &#34;GOOGLE&#34; displayed. I have never had such a problem with any device that I have ever bought. I will be returning it to Amazon. Buy at your own risk!!!!!!
---
tablet|I bought one of these and accidentally sat on it and cracked the screen. So I figured I would just buy another one and be more careful. Only I cracked it again and I didn't even drop it. If you buy one of these, you had better get insurance. And btw, I am not TKDMom. I am her foolish husband.
---
tablet|My Nexus tablet quit powering up, I think because it quit taking a charge, after only two months of owing it. From what I can ascertain after searching the web is that if the battery drains 100% and you go to recharge it, the Android operating system limits the charge rate to the battery to keep it from charging too fast and getting hot. Well evidently I've seen several people have described the same issue. Amazon will not take returns after 30 days so now I have to send it back to ASUS (the manufacturer) and wait for who knows what. What I piece of junk. I wish I would have got an iPad.

tablet|My wife was looking for a tablet and bought this because we thought Google was a pretty trusted name. I ended up fixing her laptop and afterwards she wanted nothing to do with the tablet and gave it to me. I've been incredibly underwhelmed. I'm a gamer, so I figured it would be a fun device to play with. If there are any gamers looking to buy this, I'd either recommend an iPad or waiting 6 months to see if google gets their act together. First, using the touch screen to play games is horrible. So my solution is to use a bluetooth controller.Too bad that for the past two system versions, bluetooth does not function properly. To connect to my bluetooth controller, I had to roll back the software to 4.1. If anyone is curious, rolling back the software is not easy and now I get prompts to update every 30 minutes, interrupting my usage. Oh well, I managed and the bluetooth connected fine after that. So what's the problem now? 4.1 lacks even the most basic functionality such as landscape mode. That's right, a tablet that can't do landscape. I'm shocked that google would have ever released a product that didn't have that to begin with. So now I have to choose between having a tablet that functions like a tablet or having a tablet that can play games. No matter what I choose, I lose.I can only hope that another future update corrects the bluetooth issues, but again, this has been broken since 4.2 and still remains broken despite further updates. What a waste of a device.

tablet|For any money, IMO it's impossible to do better than this. I have other tablets (2 iPads and a Xoom, to be specific, plus a Chromebook and 2 MBPs, plus 3 Kindles :), but the ease of carrying the Nexus 7 and the wide selection of Android apps makes it the one I most often have with me. Though why buy it here? Despite the fact that I am practically the most loyal Amazon customer in the world, it's significantly cheaper to buy this on [...]

tablet|I don't want to talk about positives, most of the people covered them. Great Jellybean device.I have a Amazon Kindle Fire HD too. For same price, I got half capacity with Nexus 7, also missing the HD screen or stereo speakers for the price as compared to Kindle Fire HD. But, unlike Amazon, you can install any Google Play app compatible to Nexus 7, which makes this a better choice for some people.Battery life is average. I am surprised why we don't have a USB app support for this device. How am I supposed to load my media/content into this device? I found a paid 3rd party app which I don't intend to buy or use. I hope Google or Asus addresses this issue ASAP.

tablet|So I have had a few UMD's. Specifically a Pandigital 7", Kindle Fire, Viliv s5 (winxp based pocket sized pc), and a few WinCE 5.0 devices.So far the Nexus has been by FAR the best. With the Viliv being in second place. While the Viliv can do a LOT more, the battery life isn't that great, and the graphics power is fairly lacking, making the Nexus the better choice. The Nexus 7's battery life is incredible. I use it most of the day for music playing, web surfing, light gaming, and when night time comes along its around 50% left.The video power is really impressive, no issue playing grand theft auto 3. No stutter/lag/etc.It is lacking a SD card slot, with 16 gig of memory, and not upgradable... You would really expect some form of external storage without having to root it. Rooting the device does void the warranty, but you are still able to access the market and such. I would HIGHLY recommending rooting sooner rather than later. The root process will wipe your saved games and such. Once rooted, you can install stickmount and plug in a keyboard, mouse, usb jump drive, etc, using a cheap OTG cable.Built in GPS is great and cool, lots of great ideas made it into this device. Such as cards. When you are away from home, it auto detects and tells you how long it will take to get home under current traffic conditions.Built in wifi, so you can connect while at most stores/restaurants. You can also tether to your cell and get internet connection anywhere.Built in forward facing camera... I haven't even tried this yet, but I wouldn't expect much from it.I got this for two hundred and fifty dollars at game stop, so I am rather surprised to see it for a higher price online.Over all, this is a very good unit. The OS is VERY well thought out, and complements the hardware extremely well. Haven't ran into a single issue with performance. Once rooted, you can use stuff like sd card readers, or jump drives, so the 16gb limitation isn't such a big deal.

tablet|I bought my 7 last week, my fist tablet. I was in love until I realized that the headphone jack didn't work... exchanged it, only to find that on this one the autosync for my apps didn't work & they had to all be manually installed :P. Now the screen is unstable in accepting the touch commands & switches out of the game apps. Grrr. Will I try yet another one? Probably, as it really is a cool toy. But definitely check yours out very carefully before your store return policy expires!

tablet|I pre-ordered Nexus 7 and was delivered on time. On the first day, I had trouble. The back shell cracked open when I reached out get something with the power cable connected. I noticed the power cable being short. I am using my Kindle charger and cable now. It is lengthy enough if I need to use the Nexus 7 while charging. I also noticed the USB cable that came Nexus 7 is bit tight. Connecting and pulling it out wasn't smooth. Back to the crack.... The crack is opening up day by day and the USB connector is angled now. I have to play with it for a while before I could get the charging started. I hope it doesn't give up on me.I informed Google support of the quality problem. I looked at few other devices to see where the problem is. One thing I can tell is the back shell and the rim are not glues/molded tightly. The USB cable included is not the best. Third, the length of the cable; I think Google designers didn't expect the users to use Nexus 7 while it is being charged.Otherwise, I am happy with it.

tablet|Bought Nexus 7 for daughter who's heading to college next year. At first she was all excited until she had a research to do and needed to view a video. She grab her new Nexus 7 and later found out that video play back was impossible. Why you ask? because Nexus 7 doesn't have acrobat media flash player. So I tried to play a video from Amazon instant video and come to found out that it's true, it is unable to play video/media because it doesn't have flash player. We were very disappointed. We returned the Nexus 7 within a wk from purchase date. So bottom line, the Nexus is great except that one key component of playing video. If you could live w/o video play back then this is for you. But for the others who rely and depend on video play back that needs flash player for homework, project, movies, news etc then this isn't for you. Hope this helps.

tablet|I bought my Nexus 7 for $200, and $25 in google money, and what a steal!! Does everything a iPad can do and more for a third of the cost. Besides brand image I can not understand why you would buy an inferior product like the iPad for 3x the cost. Anyhow Apple FanBoys will never stop over paying. But this is an awesome products, works seamlessly with all my files and internet contects. Took 3 mintues to set up, and I really like Google Drive and the App store is so much better than the Kindle and its locked down system.

tablet|I'm always a person who checks out the negative reviews in the one star category. It is amusing to note that in many cases they all complain about certain talking points concerning the product that no one else seems to be experiencing. The more negative reviews there are the better. This means that some other manufacturer of a similar product is afraid for their bottom line. And they send out their minions to place fear and trepadation into the minds of a possible consumer of the product they see as competition. Any rational person can see through this ruse. But there are many folks out there who won't see through it. It does a diservice to us all when these sorts of tactics have effect.I have had my Nexus 7 for months now and have not experienced any of the scary and frightening issues elucidated by the one star crowd. The Nexus 7 is a decent product that will perform properly. Is it perfect? No. It is not. But then again What Is? It has the imperfections of every electronic item. Because "imperfection" is subjective. This unit will be replaced with another and we can start the process anew. Buy it if you like it. It will work.

tablet|I'll just add my issues to what I have not seen posted about this tablet.1. Speakers are weak and can be distorting. Similar to ipod touch 4th generation speakers. HP TouchPad speakers sound noticeably better.2. Hard time picking up a weak wifi signal. Nexus 7 tablet has to be closer to the wifi source than my iPod Touch and HP TouchPad.3. Warm skin tones (more orange) from the Gallery viewer compared to same picture on my laptop.4. In my opinion: a. it is still slightly heavy for its size - it feels like I'm holding a battery in one hand (I know, that's because I am). b. the display of images and text are average; my HP TouchPad is brighter, whiter, sharper text (and not because it has a bigger screen). c. the tablet does not feel as durable as the Samsung 7" tablets, but is much lighter.I have two commonly reported problems: occasional brief screen flickering and one dead pixel (seen as a white dot on a white or light grey background and only visible at a wide tilted viewing angle - so, can't see it from normal viewing angles).After using it for over a month now, I'll keep it and use it because of its small convenient size and weight compared to a 10" tablet and counting on quick availability of official major Android updates.
---
tablet|I like the form factor of 7 inches, makes it light and easy to reach all parts of the screen while holding it comfortably.Price is certainly good, just buy it directly from the play store (or other outlet), they are in stock now and less costly.Tegra 3 makes it fast and a good user experience.You will get the latest os releases of Android straight from Google.

tablet|I bought the Nexus 7 with 16 GB in mid-August with high expectations. The product size seemed perfect. I had previously owned Kindle 1 and Kindle 2 and Ipad 1 and Ipad 2 products. My hope was that the Nexus 7 would be "just right." Within a week of purchasing it my problems started. The Nexus 7 just seemingly would not "wake up" about half of the time I tried to use it. I went to Google for customer service and the machine was reset to original factory condition, etc. People kept asking me suspiciously if I had installed any "third party software?" Duh...what do you think the Apps I installed from Google are? I started with Google support and they eventually weren't able to solve the problem and then sent me to Asus. They had me do all the same things over again without any improvement in results. ASUS eventually asked to prove that I had purchased the product by faxing in my purchase receipt. Which I did. And that I'd hear back from someone within a month. Which I never did. But I muddled on and kept using the Nexus 7 the 50% of the time that it would wake up when I asked it to. I still never heard back from ASUS and last week I dropped it on the floor and the screen cracked, so now it's toast and I guess Google and ASUS are off the hook and not responsible for the fact that they never responded to me. Oh well. They got off the hook and I'll never make this mistake again. I just placed an order for the Apple mini-Ipad so I'm done with my foray into Google/Android/ASUS/3rd party SW Hell! Google/Adroid/ASUS will not be real players with this product until they resolve that they'll guarantee their customers a first-class experience. What I was forced to sift through was hardly this and they've lost me as a customer...forever....proceed at your own risk!
---
tablet|I've received 5 defective Nexus 7 units with the loose screen issue, and over time such defects can crack the screen. This is Asus's fault, their QA is horrible. Most people actually receive defective units but don't realize it until the problem gets worse over time. The OS is awesome though. I'd wait until Google releases their revised models in late 2012. You will probably get a defective unit before then.
---
tablet|I order the nexus 7 in August when I had it delivered on 8/21/12 it was missing the USB cable. Today is 9/23/12 and as of yet nexus customer support will still not send me the missing USB cable. I would not recommend the nexus 7 based on customer support alone.

tablet|The Good:- Feels cheap, but sort of a good cheap feeling, maybe because of the texture of the plastic, but it feels cheap.The Bad- Sound is so terrible that while I'm watching something I can't even pay attention to the dialogue. I just want it to stop the whole time, and when it finally does I'm relieved. It really is that, bad I'm not exaggerating. It sounds like an old 80s tv from a motor home.- Typical Android buggy stuff like force closing and waiting on apps, sometimes not recognizing my finger, having to touch buttons on the display multiple times before they do anything. This tablet seems to have the horsepower to get through the weird stuff faster, but it's still there.- Display color isn't so true to life or bright enough. I've compared this to my Kindle Fire HD, and people on the Nexus display sorta look like they've rubbed ash on their faces or they're very sick.- I pick up my iPhone over this thing whenever I have to search or read or anything. When I pick up the Nexus instead it's just to give it some use - like I imagine a nice world where it's not annoying to use, and all of my touches make things happen, and it doesn't have weird delays and lags and make me crazy.I know iPads are boring tablets for dumb art students and ya ya ya I get it, I know. But I'm going to get an iPad mini because I'm completely tired of my attention being focused on trying to use the device, rather than what I'm trying to use the device to do.Also, I've fought the fight saying Android is better, saying Apple stuff is for people who wear colorful scarves in the summer time. I want Android to work, I voted for Romney, I like cats and not dogs... but I have to admit that Apple is clearly better.
---
tablet|Loved it when it worked! Used it for the ten hours then was never able to charge.Really want to try again but seems crazy to especially since Google took no responsibility. They referred me to LG, even though it is not a LG. Fortunately, Staples took it right back for me.Also, no rear facing camera, camera is really just for face time.
---
tablet|Finally after looking many review about tablets, I decided to buy the Google Nexus 7. My first impression was that the tablet was good for searching in the web and reading but after a day of using it I started felling something strange when I pressed the screen with my thong. Suddenly I saw and felt it was not well attached to the tablet. I `am very disappointed. For just trying not to spent lot of money on a tablet a decided to buy this one instead of an Ipad mini or something like that and I have now a tablet barely built. What a shame definitely Asus Sucks. Sorry for my mistakes as I am a Spanish speaker. People From Venezuela I don't recomend this Tablet.

tablet|The battery charge rate = TERRIBAD. I see plenty of good reviews about this thing on Amazon but if you google the device and battery issues you will see on the technical sites and forums people complaining about terrible recharge rate and bad battery experience in general. WTF. I feel ripped off.Also the week after having this thing, it has some bugginess to it. I admit I was expecting this, cause it's Android, but you have to count the negatives as... well.. negative.

tablet|At first me and my bro didnt know wat to get our 12 yr. old sis. she really wanted a tablet, but we werent going to pay big bucks for something she might loose, get stolen, etc. SHes still young wat the heck are we thinking about getting this little brat a gadget like this. BUt she loves it. It does wat a tablet is supposed to do for her: music, games, internet, youtube... Its fast but not lighting fast.

tablet|The biggest problem is that it is next to impossible to connect to an exchange server which is the feature I wanted most. When playing games, there is a constant interruption for ads. I've used iPads and HP Touch Tablet and had none of these problems. Things just seem ad heavy. I'm not into buy-buy-buy.

tablet|It was fast shipping. And its a wonderful tablet. The picture is crisp on it. and surfing on the Net is quick. I would recommened too my family and friends.
---
tablet|For me the decision was between this and the iPad. My son already has an iPad so I was a lot more familiar with it. Though all the reviews and the pricing finally persuaded me to give it a chance and I am so glad that I did. It is lightweight, easy to use, and I feel like I have more options to customize it to work the way I want it to then with my son's iPad. I have recommended it to a few people so far and they have all thanked me afterwards for connecting them with such a great product.

tablet|it is a new toy for my kids to play game and it is a good size for me to read in the bed

tablet|In my family, we have an iPad, kindle fire HD and now nexus 7... The absolute best is the iPad. However for the cost the Nexus 7 is a good low budget alternative

tablet|is perfect, It has not main camera, also has not micro sd slot, but have a perfect performance, screen, and have the best gpu already.... a nvidia tegra 3.... i compared this item with ipad 4 and nexus is better in all, nexus 7 committed my tests for speed, performance, graphics, and management of resources, and had better reaults than ipad

tablet|This is the perfect tablet. I use it to surf the web and also as an ereader. It is light enough to be a great ereader and is super fast making it great for the web. I have the Kindle Fire (original), iPad1 and the ASUS Transformer Prime. This blows all three of those away.

tablet|Now, you might be able to see I am a pretty big apple fanboy. (I do have a bias to buy their products.)I do enjot other OS, but IOS is just stupidly simple and minimalistic.HOWEVER!The nexus 7 is incredibly easy to use, and the perfect size for me!I don't enjoy the ipad's size or price as much as some, and felt the Nexus 7was the perfect thing to use for a notebook. Not only that, it's light and small soI don't have to always worry about it being destroyed in my bag.

tablet|After reading reviews and "hands on" at local store, bought the 16 G version. Worked great for two days, then just refused to turn on. Took it back, they ordered a replacement, it worked great (awesome features) for two days, then REFUSED TO TURN ON! After reading recent reviews, it seems that Asus rushes these out without quality assurance -- two dead tablets in a row is more than "random chance" in my assessment. I love the features of the Nexus, but will get a Kindle when I take this second dead tablet back this morning. Also note: I was told by the sales rep that the warrantee only covers PARTS -- you pay for the (expensive) labor if it breaks outside the return-for-refund period.

tablet|Very disappointed! The Google Nexus 7 Tablet (16 GB) would not stay connected to my network when all other devices would. Also, my Google Nexus 7 Tablet (16 GB) took a short tumble (little over 2 feet.) and the screen cracked even though the device was in a case. I have researched and found that screen cracks are very common with the Nexus 7. In fact, many people are reporting cracked screens with no fall whatsoever.I do not recommend the device.
---
tablet|I purchased three of these; the first died in two weeks and now another one has failed the exact same way. I have just read that it is out of warranty and I will lose money on the return. This really makes me examine using Amazon in the future. I trusted them and now this happens.

tablet|Pros:*clear screen*fast processor*decent wireless reception*thin and lightCons:*terrible build-quality (flickering back light, erratic recharging, loose screen, poor touch control, light bleed)*awful customer service*AsusThe tablet itself is OK, but my experience with getting a replacement, due to a number of quality issues, has been horrid. I called up Asus for an RMA and received no confirmation or RMA number. A second call had the same result. On my third attempt, I was sent the information and mailed my Nexus 7 in. The entire RMA process with Asus was completely opaque. I was told that I would receive notification when the item was received as well as when it was serviced and returned, but I received none. This was somewhat disconcerting on such an expensive device. When I received the item back (after a month of being unable to use it), it had exactly the same problems. I called Asus and they explained that the techs had simply installed the new firmware and reset. HOW WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO SOLVE MY DEFECTIVE BATTERY AND LOOSE SCREEN?! Now I have to take even more time out of my day filling out forms and going back and forth to the post office and will be without my device for another several weeks. There were no apologies, no explanations, no assurances that this wouldn't happen again,and no offers to pay for my packing materials. The phone reps generally cannot speak English and don't seem at all interested in providing a positive customer service experience. Like I said, the Nexus 7 itself is a great product and I really enjoyed what little that that I've spent with it, but any aspect in which Asus is involved (manufacture, customer service, RMA) is a complete travesty.

tablet|I've had two nexus 7s in the course of two months, and that is mainly due to the fact that the nexus screen couldn't withstand a dime being dropped on it from a 5ft height. There are stories online of screens cracking after a short time simply resting on a table.And that's when the great price gets deceiving. Not only is the screen unable to be tapped too roughly, but I couldn't buy a warranty with it, so Asus has tried to get $160 out of me for the repairs. Making this $200 machine closer to $360, but who's to say the replacement screen is any stronger?Be aware that this seemingly cheap and powerful tablet can and very well (unless you are the type to encase your device in bubble wrap when you aren't using it) cost you more and more as you use it. I don't think I'll check if third time is in fact the charm with this one.I'll just wait and hope they recall it so that I can get the device I was hoping for.I'd GLADLY have paid more for a more durable device, and you should too.

tablet|This is the fastest and most efficient tablet I have seen. It is well worth the money and outperforms even the ipad as far as quickness in processing commands and with a keyboard that is crisp and clean. The display is good and I like the 7" size in that I can hold it in one hand with ease while reading. I am thoroughly enjoying mine. I think this has been a good investment I've made and I'm proud of it.
---
tablet|Owned for 7 weeks. I have all the same problems, sans the screen separation, reported where ever you want to look. Without exception the problems ie unresponsive touch screen, slowness, loading apps with half of screen blank, have been dealt with by either turning the device off then on or force shutting the device down by holding the on/off button down until the screen goes blank. That being said I like my Nexus 7. It is fast and when functional is a good device. In the interest of full disclosure, I have a return number that is good for 30 days. The problem is I don't want to do without my device for the two weeks ASUS says my Nexus 7 will be gone. So for now, Damn I have to get shut my device down to finish this! (lol just kidding. I do like my device and I am hopeful the issues will be fixed soon)
---
tablet|I returned my Nexus 7 today (after only a day). I had many problems with the unit! When I first setup the unit everything worked fine, but as I began making changes (ie. adding apps and customizing the unit) I started having problems. First, the wifi bars would only display grey, not blue. This mostly occurred after putting the unit to sleep and waking it up again. The Internet worked fine, but I couldn't access Google Play Store without getting a "server error" message. I tried airplane mode, disable/re-enable wifi, and turning wifi off and on. The only way I could correct the problem was to factory reset.I also had problem running videos on YouTube app and webpage. The videos would stop frequently.Two times the sound quite working while playing video clips and using the unit which required restart.I know it's not google's / ASUS fault, but not being able to run Adobe Flash is a shame.I'm sure someone reading this will want to blame my home network, but I'm currently running other wireless devices (including an ASUS tablet) without problems.From the rave reviews of this unit online, I must have received a lemon. Either way, I called and requested a return of the unit.Shawn

tablet|Having used the google nexus table for couple of months I can say that it is one of my worst purchase ever.List of issues with my device:1. Battery: It takes more than 9 hours to get fully charged, at times even after plugging in for several hours it shows that it got charged only 1%.2. Touch pad: I have to hit an alphabet/number several times before only then it appears on the screen.3. Separation of screen from the back of the device.All these issues have cropped up only after a month or so of using it.And the worst part is Google return policy/customer service sucks! When I contacted them to replace this device, they said they can repair it, for which I have to pay the shipping costs.I did not expect that a company like google would be putting out such a poor quality device and the worst return policy and customer service. Looks like google just wanted to launch the device in the market soon without much QA/QC done.

tablet|Well, I just returned a 16G Nexus 7 at day 14...I found no issues with build quality until I tested the headphones. Each jack insertion came with bzzz and buzzing that stopped until the next tension on the cord. Also I found the volume to be weak and the sound equalizer difficult to find and launch (I'm probably at the end of the treasure hunt pack). Oh well...maybe the next generation...
---
tablet|Too small to do any real work. i read books on it but already have a kindle so its redundant. i like the android OS as i have a Droid phone and find it easy to work with.Not very useful due to its small size. perhaps a 10&#34; model would be more functional.one annoying factor....unlike my phone which operates in landscape mode when turned, the Nexus only has portrait mode (unless there is something i don;t know). surprised that it lacks this capability
---
tablet|Nice fast machine, but why do they even bother making a tablet without as SD slot? So we run out of space and have to buy something else?For that reason alone I'm going to buy something else.But the logic is clear, an SD slot + interface could maybe cost the manufacturer another 5$.So annoying!
---
tablet|very good item jus i bought the item 1 week ago an i paid 265 an now it like 226 an that sucks
---
tablet|I am very happy with the device itself. Smooth scrolling, clear picture, and excellent service from Google Play. I was not especially happy with the price I had to pay, roughly $50 more than ordering direct from Google Play. Sorta sounds like gouging, doesn't it?
---
tablet|Let me make this simple. I'm on it right now. Had it up and running on my wiffy (wifi) in 30 seconds. LOVE everything about it. Plus it's an Asus. Nuff said.
---
tablet|I purchased the Nexus 7 and returned it only after a day. I purchased a movie from google play and couldn't even watch it because it kept constantly buffering. Very annoying. Also I found myself asking what do I really need this thing for when I already have a laptop and an iphone? I'm thinking about buying the Kindle Fire HD but still not sure yet.
---
tablet|I love this Tablet to death but the 16gb (really 12gb storage available) killed the experience for me..It felt great, it was fast, the screen was amazing...But I need more space for apps. Also missing HDMI, SD card support and front camera ..They should of released a 32gb version..it would of been perfect..25gb is perfect..I don't stream my content, i love having everything locally. And the worst part no SD Support.
---
tablet|This is by far the worst tablet I've ever owned. I figured since I had a Nexus phone that runs great that the Nexus 7 would follow suit. I was wrong. I don't know if it's because of ASUS or what but the tablet runs slower than my Samsung Nexus. Some games were so laggy I couldn't even play them and all of the other "tablet" apps were the same apps that were on my phone, only stretched out. My wife has an iPad mini with half the specs but appears to run twice as fast. I guess what looks good on a spec sheet and what actually works are two different things. I already returned this thing. Maybe i'll give a Windows 8 tablet a try. If you're in the market for a smaller tablet I would get the iPad mini or try out a kindle.
---
tablet|If the screens breaks... no if the screen cracks... no when the screens has crack the device must be thrown away. repair fee is over the price of a new one. And no you can't fix it yourself.
---
tablet|I think the nexus 7 by purchasing inexpensive.Due to the LCD screen initialization and crack down, but I received the product yesterday, I have not even seen.Contact ASUS service center today, and LCD screen replacement cost of $ 113.Service costs more than the value of the stuff contains a lot of you feel that's not good.Rather to buy new stuff ......
---
tablet|Absolutely fantastic kit at very reasonable price.Did everything from surfing, gaming to reading e-books.I bought it to surf on bed so that I can banish my laptop to the work table.
---
tablet|Besides the upper price over original (getting from google) the tablet is exelent, brigth and deliver quickly. My rate of 4 stars is because the tablet came with some details on the back (2 tiny yellow dots).
---
tablet|The tablet is great but less than a week after I got the usb charger it stopped working. Tough to use a product if it cant charge.
---
tablet|Been wanting an iPad but it's to pricey and you've thinking of Getting the Nexus 7? Do it, you will not be disappointed. For the price, you can't get any better. This thing is nice. Easy to use,runs great, and just the right size. Don't let the fact that it's not Apple scare you.. This is a good quality product'

tablet|My nexus fell off a two ft table onto carpet and the screen shattered and therfore no longer works. This device was only a few weeks old and bought with hard worked for money. Unbeliveable to me that such a flawed device is on the market. Buyer beware...buy another brand!
---
tablet|I was wrong!Never had been fooled like that!35 days and nothing!The lack of commitment of this company is very big!Congrats you managed to destroy my Christmas and New Year!

tablet|I got this fr y mom as a early Christmas gift and she loves it! A gift must have :-)

tablet|It only took over 2 months before ASUS released official accessories for the Nexus 7 but with that the product got a lot stronger. I've edited my review in light of the release (previously I was disappointed by a lack of official accessories from ASUS - I've been without a cover or dock for 2 months as I wanted an official one).The initial round of Nexus 7 tablets were not without flaws - I had to send my original back due to the screen popping out. ASUS has fixed this issue and all new Nexus 7 tablets no longer have this problem.Outside of my initial issue and the long time for accessories, the Nexus 7 is a solid tablet. Unlike the iPad, you will bring this everywhere with you. It's the perfect size and weight for taking it along with you. The lack of 3g might be an issue for some, but really how many times are you without wifi during your day? For most people, it's not an issue. For the select few it is an issue for, there is always the option of enabling the mobile hotspot feature on phones (provided you subscribe to the service).Otherwise, the biggest current flaw the Nexus 7 has is a lack of native landscape mode in several areas (particularly the home screen). This is a design choice by Google but it's a poor one (I should be able to toggle this ability without 3rd party downloads). If you want your home screen, etc in landscape expect to shell out a couple bucks for a 3rd party solution.Overall It's a hell of a tablet and the pure Google experience makes it a must have for anyone with an ounce of technical knowledge.

tablet|This tablet is extremely buggy.Mac compatibility issues - File transfer requires the Android File Transfer program to be installed on Macs because the tablet is not recognized as a external drive/disk but rather a media component. The program itself is a dumbed down version of a file explorer. The program disconnects/connects the tablet intermittently as if the USB cable was loose (it wasn't). Also, there seems to be a bug where if you create a folder, delete it, and recreate it with the same name, the program will think that your tablet is locked and will give an error. Then if you unplug and plug the tablet it, the folder will be there. Im pretty sure this is a delete function bug where it doesn't actually delete and instead "hides" your file/folder until you reboot the device (not a quick process)Wifi Issues - Wifi is required to "activate" or reset this tablet - theres a prompt screen that asks you to select your Wireless Signal upon first startup. No Wifi? No tablet. I found this out when I reset it during a flight and didn't have a wireless signal to re-enable it again. I couldn't get past the prompt screen, which means I couldn't even upload files from my computer and use it as a video/audio player, ebook reader, or even a flashlight.Wifi Issues continued - When losing a wifi connection, a pop-up will appear saying "Google Play Store stopped working" as if it had crashed, when really it just means it cant connect. And it does it multiple times. Annoying when you know you don't have wifi.Wifi Issues continues again - This tablet seems to be wifi dependent. If I remove a widget from the home screen(the "My Library" which displays content in a cool collage on the home screen) and then try to put it on my home screen again, it wont do it without a wifi connection.Default Applications - the default applications look great until you start uploading your own content. The default ebook reader wont read your ebooks. I couldn't even find the file directory to put the books in. Same with the magazine app. The video player can only play mp4 videos, and not all mp4 files (go check your movie folder, most if not all video files are avi.) The photo gallery displays the ebook covers for some strange reason. Basically, I have had to download 3rd party apps from the google play store just play my own content, bloating my tablet with two apps for each function - 1 app for google content, and another app for everything else.Form Factor - on/off and volume buttons are located right next to each other and almost identical in feel. I find myself pressing a button, waiting for it to turn on, and then realizing its not the right button. Ive also turned it off while trying to adjust the volume. Not the best design. Also, they are tucked under the tablet edges, not facing the face or sides of the tablet but more toward the back. This means they wont be accidently bumped and theyre easy to use if its in your hands, but if its on a table you would have to lift and slightly turn the tablet to access them. Volume comes out the back of the tablet and max volume isn't that high.TLDR: Biggest con is poor compatibility with audio/video/ebook content. Wifi dependent. Form factor needs tweaking. If you're a consumer sheep buy it, works great the way it was meant to work (buying all your content from Play store. If youre not, buy it still for the hardware, but prepare yourself for some frustration or wait a while for software updates.too

tablet|Overall, it's a nice unit and I am satisfied with it. It is responsive. The display and sound are good. I bought it with knowledge of its pre-existing worts (i.e., no expansion slot, no USB To Go capability, and no rear-facing camera). With the OS X-Android app on my iMac I can exchange small files (pix, music, etc.) between the iMac and the Nexus 7; however, I have not been successful in copying large files such as videos.What I really have problems with is the Android 4.1 (Jellybean) OS. When I tried to install several of my favorite apps, such as Amazon Market, from the Google Play Store I got a message saying the app was not compatible with my version od Android.A minor but persistent irritant is that even the lightest, most casual touch of the viewing screen brings up a wallpaper setting popup window.
---
tablet|The dimensions of the device is pretty good. In terms of software experience, it is the same Android OS that you may find with other brand tablets. The LCD screen of this model is so poor that it broke in front my eyes when fell from the top of a stack of books to the table. That's about 4 inches of a fall. When you start searching this issue on the internet, you will see that there is a significant number of customer that are on the same boat. Everybody is complaining and there are no resolution from neither Google nor Asus.Regardless this tablet is branded "Google", Google does not claim any responsibility. It will take a day or so just to get in touch with someone from Asus after waiting couple hours on the phone. They are saying that they experience high call volumes. No wonder, many people are calling support for service. Anyways, Asus will not cover any screen damage under warranty, but may replace the screen for $200 plus shipping. So it is cheaper to buy a new one. On the other hand, I would not buy anything from Asus anymore.
---
tablet|I bought this product driven by the low price. It lasted two weeks only. Look for other quality products and don't be scammed by these low quality offers.

tablet|Updated on 12/30.-------------------------------------Now I have found scientific proof that the display of Nexus 7 is definitely below the average. According to DisplayMate dot com, a website specialized scientific ways to benchmark displays, Nexus 7's display is rated only B-, when compared with Apple iPad mini (B) and Amazon Kindle Fire HD (A-). The noted problems of Nexus 7's display include dithered 24-bit color, false contouring, washed out color and contrast for photos and videos, and Poor Display Calibration.Sorry I cannot post the URL. But you can google "iPad mini Display Technology Shoot-Out" to read the details.I am very happy that my eyes did not betray me!!--- Original comments----------Just like Digital cameras, high numbers of pixels do not necessarily mean better display than mediocre number of pixels.My nexus 7's display is sharp and detailed when displaying black/white text contents.But the color rendering is horrible for photos and videos. Pictures are grainy and color is off, especially for human faces in photos (best way to tell color accuracy of a display is to view photos with faces since we are genetically sensitive to facial details!!).It looks like the depth of color is too low.Very disappointed. The tablet is otherwise a very decent choice. I just returned it to the retailer (sears)

tablet|I love my new nexus. I had never had a tablet till a month ago when I acquired a used first generation IPad. I enjoyed it, but thought something smaller and lighter would be more fun. I didn't realize that it would also be better. I've used android phones for years....currently Galaxy S3...( I'm at Verizon or I would have the Note.)...Why does this seem so much faster and smoother than the S3? How much of this is Jelly Bean? Within a day, I was upset with Google for not making the nexus 4G, so I could ditch my S3 and carry a good ole dumb flip phone (I enjoyed those)-----In two days, I wished Google had included 4G AND a phone, so I could just carry my Nexus. I guess I have big hands, but it doesn't seem too large to be a phone. Besides, I doubt that I'm the only person who uses his phone as a phone...very little. Now I'm using a stylus for the first time and typing faster than ever. (Thanks for putting the apostrophe on the ABC page.)....Google, make me one of these with an SD card slot & 4G & a phone!!!!!!!!!and reach perfection. Till then.....thanks for the Nexus 7. Whoops...1 thing: I can't get HBO Go......are they not ready for Jelly Bean? Gotta fix this. And, tho everyone says it's past----there's a Lotta times that one needs Flash.
---
tablet|At first, I was happy with my Nexus. I used it for about a month, and then the problem started. It wouldn't turn on. I held the power button down for 10 minutes, and it wouldn't turn on. Then, magically it would turn on - by itself! After a trip, I plugged my Nexus in for a recharge- and since then- it won't turn on at all!I wish I had read all of the online reviews about this problem because it's rampant. Now, since it's past 30 days, I am stuck with this $300 machine that won't work!!!My advice- DON'T BUY A NEXUS! It will last just a few days past your return window- and BANG- the lights will go out- for good!
---
tablet|I had my Nexus 7 for only 2 days, then I realized that there were serious issues with the phone jack. When headphones or earphones were plugged in, the sound was often coming out from only one side or the other, or even coming out from the loudspeaker or from the headphones in turn. Those issues were serious enough for me to take the Nexus 7 back to the store to get reimbursed. Otherwise, the device was fine but I cannot conceive possessing a tablet that I'm not able to listen to music with. It's a pity the maker didn't pay attention enough to that aspect. I knew that other people were experiencing the same problem by typing "headphone jack issues with Nexus 7" in a well-known search engine. So, you'd better make sure that the audio jack performs correctly before or just after buying your tablet so that you can take advantage of the warranty period, for reimbursement or replacement if need be. As for me, I'll be waiting some time for making my final decision : other makers are told to release 7-inch tablets in the weeks to come. We'll check the reviews when those new products hit the market.
---
tablet|Turns out the screen of the Asus Nexus 7 is very fragile. If you are used to dropping your phone or iPad all the time while they are not getting damaged then don't get the Nexus 7. Google "nexus 7 cracked screen" to see what I mean. Lots of people with cracked screens out there. Too bad since this is otherwise a good device.

tablet|great tab great price works fine now that androidOS is @ Icecream just disappointed that 1 week after recieving price went down $50 amd 32gb released #fail

tablet|UPDATED-22/2/2013I was able to bypass the set up to unlock my internet. I held a finger on the screen untill the copy menu came up; saved my internet lock website, and then opened up a new browser. I got connected and then I restarted really quick got back to the set up screen and got it all set up. Now then I have not been playing with it to much but the google play store and the responsiveness make me enjoy it more then my other tablet.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, I cannot get past the set screen. My Wi-Fi is secured through a website here. To access the internet you must first go to this log in website. The setup menu takes you to the google set up. There is no work around. I am stuck. I wish I could give more of a review, but I cannot. I have mashed the power and volume buttons to get the reboot screen and tried all the options and still nothing. I have plugged it into my computer still nothing. I even plugged it into a wireless router via the micro usb still nothing.This has a headphone jack and a micro usb on the bottom of the tablet.The micro usb is made for charging the tablet.180 degrees from that is the camera it is dead center of the top.The top right hand corner is the power and volume buttons.On the bottom left hand corner is a 4 pin connector, which is what the manual calls it I am not sure what it would be used for.On the top there is a small pin hole that is a reset button from what I can tell.The tablet is lighter than my Coby Kyros, this was to be my upgrade.There is NO spot for added memory.The micro usb should also be able to be used with an adapter to hook up a thumb drive or hard drive; I do it with the Kyros so I would hope that this also gives you that option.

tablet|This was an awesome tablet... for the month I had it. It fell 3 feet (with a cover cushioning the fall) and it cracked, the entire bottom half of the screen is unresponsive and useless, and If you buy through amazon there is going to be practically zero support for when it breaks. Be very careful with this product

tablet|Question: Why is the 8gb not $200, as it is on other sites? Just curious if someone knows. I thought that the 8gb version was supposed to be $200, and the 16gb version was $250?

tablet|Cause i have to ROOT it to enable microUSB port, so, I wont do it cause I wont be always looking on web to the latest cheated Android..... I like the UPDATES... only buyin google you will keep UPDATED.

tablet|I have a T-mobile Springboard and bought this to replace it but will keep the Springboard. The resolution and color on the Springboard is substantially better and sharper than this at same resolution as this. The professional reviewers say the same thing also that the color and sharpness is not good for Nexus 7. The Springboard is $300 and includes 4g with hotspot, etc. It is a little heavier but the color and sharpness is far superior to this. The speed is faster on the nexus thus I gave it a 2 star. Many applications on the older OS is missing for this 4.1. If this is 1280x800 then they got a lot of work to do. One of my utilities says the resolution is not 1280x800 but lower. My springboard also lower but much sharper. I used Android system info. Applications including home screen do not orientate to horizontal position! Youtube orientates to horizontal ok but not email and many other applications. Orientation appears selective or predetermined. Not sure if it has same sensor as other devices or they preprogram what apps are to use the orientation sensor. In any case it is irritating they have this problem. Samsung player orientates email no problem. The orientation problem is fixed with the orientation icon at top of screen so most apps orient ok except home screen. No big deal. I own 5 Android devices by the way so I know what I am talking about. Major apps missing such as Bloomberg, QQ 2012 which few million in China use. I am unable to watch numerous videos for news and other apps because it does not support flash player anymore. I am waiting for the new Apple 7" coming out next month because I need the apps on the old 3.2 Android which Apple all has.

tablet|This game is awsome you should make more places you can go to though but all together it's a great game think about more places

tablet|So after two weeks of getting the new device afterthe first one showed up DOA, the screen shattered in my pocket. Which wouldmake sense if I dropped it or had my keys in with it. However, in thiscase it was in my front pocket by itself in the official case and was lightlytapped by a door and crunch. I don't know if this qualifies for a returnbut I was expecting a little more durability from Google/Asus. Especially since I have been using ASUS mobos for years.

tablet|i just git my google nexus7 16 gb i had returned the new ipad 3. i was not happy with if as i have an ipad 2 and this was eaqsier to set up and by working with it for 5 minutes i really like it and wouls say for half the money it was a great deal. now my ipad will have some rest

tablet|Save your money! This is what I get for being an early adopter (one week after it became available). I bought this device to take on a 3-week vacation so my wife and I could keep in touch with our business contacts, but we spent more time fighting the Nexus flaws than actually using its highly touted (by Google) capabilities.Let's start out with the most serious problem. After about two weeks into our vacation in Colorado, the screen started flickering. Maybe Al Gore's on to something: the altitude affected the electronics (nope, it's still flickering here in Missouri). My wife and I are long-time computer professionals and I can tell when a component is malfunctioning. Google's support people don't have an answer for that.Next, some ergonomic issues.When you're typing something, say an email, if you intend to hit the space bar, but accidentally hit the Home icon which is jammed right up under the space bar, you are sent back to the Home screen and what you've typed is wiped out, so you have to start all over again.It's crazy that the two-finger expansion feature that lets you increase the size and readability of a web site doesn't work with a downloaded e-book. You're forced to try to read a book with "tiny type." My eyes aren't what they used to be, so this is a problem for me.Why can't the Home page rotate like other screens?Want to listen to a movie or music on an airplane? Forget about it. The sound is so weak, even at the maximum setting, and even at home with no competing ambien noise, it is next to impossible to hear. Ear buds didn't help on the airplane.Then, there's the Chrome browser for Nexus. Not the same as the PC version. Extremely hard to set up. Unlike Internet Explorer, where you can start many instances so that you can compare two or more data sets, Nexus Chrome only allows you to start more tabs, so you have to switch back and forth between tabs to compare data points.Something else was screwy with Nexus Chrome--we needed to access our credit union savings account to transfer money to our credit card account (we maxed it out a couple of times because of vacation expenses--Colorado is an expensive place), but Chrome somehow got in the way of our ability to access our account. Our username and password were not recognized, yet we could go to the hotel business center (two different hotels) and use a real PC and Internet Explorer with no problem. Screwy things were also happening when we tried to use Gmail and Hughesnet webmail. Same deal: business centers worked just fine.Google Play? There's no way I could figure out what my account balance was. Amazon always knows what I'm doing. I'm amazed that a technologically superior company like Google has such a poor website.Some people are thrilled that there's a user guide on the Nexus. I am never thrilled by a reference book that has no index. I tried in vain to find out how to operate the built-in camera and finally support told me that it was not for actually taking pictures like an iPad or iPhone, but only for online chats. (Still don't have a clue as to how to use it and there is no clue online).Google also assumes that whoever buys one of these dandies is a longtime Android user, so that many of the instructions in the user guide are vague, relying on the aforementioned assumption. (I can't use an Android phone because I live miles from the nearest cell tower and my Hughesnet ISP connection is too slow. There's also the issue of pouring money down a crawfish hole for a data plan.)In their rush to get this device on the market, Google did not have a carrying case at the time of release of the Nexus. I bought a Kindle case at Walmart that was adequate, but was not really optimum for the Nexus.There are other issues, like being useless for printing boarding passes, but I'm getting tired, so I'll finish by expressing my surprise and frustration with Google's apparent ineptitude with this device. Like Microsoft, they have never had any desire to deal directly with the public and they don't know how. They've built so many barricades against direct communication, it's tough to figure out how to contact their support group.Support is willing when you finally figure out how to contact them, but like most support orgs, they treat you like you're a dummy, because that's what their script demands. Performing a factory reset will not make a flickering screen go away.I use Google exclusively for search functions and have loved it since it was introduced. That's why I'm so disappointed that such an astute company has failed so miserably with the Nexus 7.I'd like to get my money back, but Google doesn't seem to be able to handle that, either. Support sent me a UPS return label. On October 10, someone in Texas signed for the return. Now, on November 6, I still have not received my credit. Support says I have to wait 14 business days, not including weekends. Guess how long it took them to take my money? Microseconds.

tablet|Okay for people who like basic and fragile things but people demanding most,not recommend it since the screen is very fragile and does not bring to accommodate more memory.

tablet|We waited so long to buy a tablet from Google and we love it. However, 3 weeks after we bought it, we found out the same tablet with larger storage will be soon on the market for the same price. I planned to buy a couple more for my family for Xmas, but now I'm so disappointed that I will buy Samsung Note 10.1 instead. BTW. I could not find any way how to let Google know how they let their customers down, that's why I gave it 1 star.

tablet|Wonderful, wonderful..........yadda-yadda.Uh.......no.To think someone would market a tablet without a mini-USB or chip slot is beyond understanding.Doesn't matter what else it does or how good it does it, this outstandingly stupid oversight makes it unusable.Think I will pass........

tablet|Purchased this in September from Staples and it's a 15-day return policy. See I bought two of these, so I can compare all the problems I was having with mine NEW OUT OF BOX.(1) Charging at the same time and using at the same time doing the same things at the same settings.. mine would run out of batteries first.(2) The part where I plug in my tablet for charging constantly fell off -broken-so just the little plastic coming off I thought it's minor so instead of making a trip to the store I just dealt with it(3)I purchased in Sept. Before price drop but NEVER got my $25 Google play credit as the other tablet did.(4) I call Staples they say contact Google. I contact Google they say contact Asus-had to repeat myself the issue so many times to ship it in for repairs- they still didn't deal with the $25 dollar problem. SO I JUST TAKE IT AS A LOSS sat this point. WHERE DO I GO TO NOW??(5) This is why I sent it in to repair: constantly had to hold down 10sec to turn on --in the beginning it was after charging- later on it was ALL THE TIME ; Sometimes it will be stuck on charging screen and won't turn on until 1/3 battery is drained or all is drained; Constantly restarted itself in the middle of a task; It was like my tablet had a mind of it's own and gave me new surprise ALL THE TIME!(6) After it came back from Asus Repair. Worked for 3 days- and then went COMPLETELY DEAD after I tried to charge it when the battery bar just turned red. Plugged it in to charge.. I come back it's still uncharged. I re-plugged it in the charger.. battery displays empty okay I leave it for charge and then come back it won't even turn on. Flashes Google screen then the X screen then it's OUT COLD (repeated this 10x on diff times so assume its' completely dead)........... wth?? So it's worse than it was before I shipped it in to repair. SERIOUSLY??? They wouldn't think it's less costly for Asus to have done it right the first time and just replace my tablet with a new one? This thing is a piece of crap. Just a waste of my time and money. I told them I've been having all these problems since the beginning before the 15 day return but do they care?? NO! -I have just recontacted them - it's been 2 days now - All I get is the guy telling me oh You having adapter problems? I'm not part of the engineering department but I can help you if you want to replace your adapter - assuming he means buying a new one. - seriously?? I NEED TO SHIP THIS THING back in will take another whole 2 weeks to get them to Help me with an RMAWhat's sad is I bought this for school so I can follow the pdf notes since the prof goes so fast in class while taking notes while recording the lecture with an app. See I shipped it in to repair took about a month. So by the time I got back it's already Exam 1 and so okay Exam 1 just finished I'm like okay 2 more exams to go and I just got my tablet back. (DIES) seriously?!! NOW I have to ship it back again.. it's like half way thru the semester already. SO WHY DID i EVEN bOTHER GOING WITH ASUS?? I SHOULD have stuck with IPAD Or something that WORKS!!!So word of advice.. Okay guys if you are having any minor problems with your tablet like the adapter plastic falling off revealing all the wires or something that's so minor u wouldn't think it will affect your tablet STILL RETURN IT WITHIN THe 15 day pOLICY and geT A NEW ONE until you're satisfied. OTHERWISE- YOU WILL GO THROUGH HELL LIKE ME- THis tablet is cheaply made HIT OR MISS KIND.... - I should have just returned it when I realize I couldn't get my $25 dollar. But I'm also the kind that leaves my purchased product in the box for like maybe a month before I open it. So don't do what I did guys.

tablet|Comparing my new Nexus 7 to my old iPad 1:Nexus 7 is no clearer and, to my dismay, much slower than my iPad 1. The Nexus 7s functionality seems to take a step back to the rotary phone era. I gave this Nexus 7 to myself and a new iPad mini to my wife for Christmas. No comparison! Her iPad mini, with its supposedly inferior clarity, is so superior to this dinosaur of a pad, it is too bad I was sucked in by the hype and the CNET reviews of Nexus. Believe me - this Nexus is a great step backwards in technology. I'm taking all my gift cards and getting me an iPad mini today! The iPad system is so much easier, brighter, clearer and technologically superior for the user - and that's my iPad 1 I'm speaking of. I've also run iPhone 3, 4, and now 4s. Even all of those are superior to my new Nexus. And Google - are you kidding! I'm still a PC guy, but these little toys have even gotten me thinking about Macs. This little 7" pad is a JOKE. And apps - compared to Apple apps and iTunes, the apps for Nexus take us back to the days of the telegraph. To do anything on the Nexus takes many strokes and waves of the hand and fingers where, with my old old old iPad, life was so much simpler and so much better. I hope I can find an iPad mini for next day delivery.

tablet|My brother bought this brand new tablet, when it came in the mail we pressed the power button but it didn't start so we thought it must be out of power. Then we plugged it into the charger a battery appeared on the displayed showing that it was charging, after 5 seconds the displayed turned off we thought it was strange but we waited till next morning to see if full charge will help. Next morning after waiting all night while it was charging the tablet would not start we connected to the charger again display showed full battery after 5 seconds display turned off and that was it. We contacted amazon and they told us they will replace the product. I'm not trying to discourage you from buying this product it may have just been that this tablet was not functioning properly and amazon was happy to replace it.

tablet|I agree with almost all the good said about Nexus 7, so I'll list out the bad. I hope that this will balance your information.1. The touch screen isn't as smooth as iPad. little glitches when I scroll at uneven pace. I'm a pure iOS user and may be got spoiled by how smooth iOS is. Perhaps I'm picky, you may not even notice it.2. screen would flicker in dark room. flickering is subtle but I noticed it while reading and it bothered me. In a lighted room, can't notice anything. Auto brightness was tried On or Off and same result.3. No back camera! I want that more than the front camera.finally, the big bad4. weak construction or low quality gauge! The front glass isn't tightly fitted with the outer frame. When I press the edge of the glass, it pushes into the frame a little bit and I can see the LCD make like a liquid dimple. On my tablet, this problem is all along the left side but not the other edges. Perhaps the problem is Asus. I never did like Asus quality.

tablet|This is the single worst piece of electronics I have ever owned. It is impossible to keep this thing charged. Sometimes you plug it in and it will partially charge, sometimes fully charge, sometimes, won't charge at all.If you let it go completely dead, it will not come back to life until you do some random series of things and then it will mysteriously come back to life.when it works, it's so overloaded with nonsense that you have to throw half the preinstalled stuff away just to get it down to something simple.I do not have an ipad, so I can't compare. I just know everyone who has one likes it, and I really don't like this thing, so I have to believe there is some significant difference.The form factor on this is not good - more convenient to pack into things, but when you are using a web page , you will be CONSTANTLY expanding and contracting the screen.Volume is terrible.Perhaps as a bedside reader it might work I guess. But keep it plugged in.
---
tablet|The worst tablet i know!! In 10 days fail the screen. I am very sad, i hope much more from Google.
---
tablet|I went thru four before giving up and returning the item! The tablet I received were poorly manufactured. The first had a bad screen. The second the screen was not attached well. The Third and forth suffered the same issue!!!
---
tablet|This is almost an Emperor Has No Clothes review. Everyone seems ecstatic about this product but they seem as blind as the iPhone fan boys. The Nexus 7 is seriously flawed unless you consider an intolerably poor battery life and the most finicky charger issue not a problem. Charge up my iPad, yes I have one of them too, and use it for three days and it has more battery left than the Nexus has charged at the same time and not used. I have a ton of USB chargers and the Nexus only will charge using less than two out of ten of these. A real pain when traveling in that I need to make certain I have the correct charger for the Nexus. Worse, not a single battery backup or car charger that I have or bought special for it will work. On the more trivial issue the home page does not rotate. Avoid the product and get the Samsung, you will be much happier with it.
---
tablet|Beware! The only thing good about this thing is the screen. Apps are limited to those with lots, and lots of ads. Further, they shut down and don't work all the time. Trying to pick up Wifi other than at home is futile. The Kindle changes pages if you change position. Save a little more money and get an iPad. They've got a long way to go on this thing. I hate it.
---
tablet|I LOVED THE NEXUS 7 WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT.I'M A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN WHO USES MANY MUSICAL APPS VIA BLUETOOTH TO TEACH MY STUDENTS.I RECOMMENDED THE NEXUS 7 TO THEM AND MANY BOUGHT IT.WITH THE LATEST UPDATE ALL THE APPS WE USE HAVE AN ANNOYING STUTTER(ONLY WITH BLUETOOTH) WHICH MAKES IT USELESS AND I FEEL BAD FOR MY STUDENTS WHO BOUGHT THIS ON MY RECOMMENDATION.I HAVE SEVERAL MACS THAT ARE DEPENDABLE AND I'M BEGINNING TO THINK I SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR THE MINIPAD.I CAN'T FATHOM HOW ANY COMPANY COULD RELEASE SUCH AN OBVIOUS FLAW IN AN UPDATE WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT WITHIN 20 SECONDS IF THEY TOOK THE TIME TO LISTEN TO THEIR OWN UPDATE.I'M SURE IN TIME THEY'LL FIX THIS BUT THIS MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS ABOUT FUTURE UPDATES FROM GOOGLE.I'M NOT ALONE IN THIS SINCE I'VE SEEN 100S OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET.IF BLUETOOTH IS A MAJOR PART OF YOUR REASON FOR BUYING THIS,THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO A LITTLE RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT.
---
tablet|I bought this for my husband as a gift. He was reading on his HTC phone and thought this would be a nice thing for him. Larger screen, Android OS. More affordable than the iPad.It worked great. The resolution was good. The operating system was smooth. He was able to download things easily for Google Play.About 3 weeks later- he dropped it. On the hardwood floor. Now we have a Nexus 7 with a cracked screen. The estimate to fix it? About $160. Thanks, but no thanks.I'm waiting for the iPad Mini.
---
tablet|I looked up hundreds of reviews and could not find one negative review about the google nexus 7 guess mines with be the first while its lighter and sleeker then the kindle fire its know where near as durable I had the nexus for 2 days and while reading a book on it on the bus a passanger knocked it out my hands it fell about a foot and the screen cracked and the touch screen stop working I have had my kindle fire since November and have drop it several times and it still dose not have a scratch on it second with know flash player there are a lot of videos that will not pay on the nexus I have yet to find a video that wont play on the kindle thank God I was able to get a full refund and will stick with my kindle fire!
---
tablet|The tablets were gifts therefore I have no idea how they are, any features, pros and cons. I'm guessing they're fine since the person ordering it wanted those specifically.
---
tablet|Screen Cracks very easily. Google had to cut a lot of corners to get the price down to 200 bucks.Just goes to show you get what you pay for. First my cord malfunction then I had to use another cord. I tripped on that cord and broke the screen with barely any effort.
---
tablet|I find this device to be disappointing. I have the WiFi enabled model and find its functionality to be limited since many times WiFi is not available. The tight integration with Google makes for an easy startup experience, but when it comes time to add features and functions beyond Google the device is not intuitive. I also find the screen size small and the viewing ratio difficult. I own an iPad and find it a much more useful tablet.
---
tablet|This is a very good tablet. I "used" to love it. I want a replacement from them because it wasn't working properly, but after I contacted them they promised a replacement but it took them about a week or two to reply. In the end I got so mad, I was like I just want my money back. They said unfortunately it passed the 15 days buyers remorse time so I can only get a replacement. So I was like I don't want a replacement and this and that. But in the end I just thought this is getting so annoying so I agreed to a replacement. At the last email I sent them asking how to send the defective one back for a new one, they didn't even respond. Now I have to email them again for a new tablet. After getting a new tablet I still need to throw that online and sell it. At first I thought it was a great value so I bought it in the end of August but it didn't work properly after approximately 2 weeks. After I think about 3 weeks the condition got worst so I needed to contact them. But in the end I got no reply for my email and I'm still going to need to go through a ton of trouble to get a replacement and then sell it online. And I don't even know if I'll be able to sell it because many people are selling it and I paid $286.33 for it and with accessories it's over $300 so I don't want to loose that much money. I still want my money back but of course I can't, they'll never give it back. A replacement is better than nothing. In the past when I buy off the internet and things don't work I get a refund really easily or a replacement with just one email. I'll never shop online for electronics again, this was the first and worst experience ever. This is just my opinion, I'm not giving you people suggestions or anything, just saying my experience. And I didn't get the tablet off this site (got it on google play) so I don't think you need to worry about it.

tablet|I brought nexsus 7(16GB)from Google on sep 29 2012, its Price dropped within a month, its a big bummer from Google, I really never expected this from Google, I think Google will never grow with customer trust with such a careless attitude about its customers(with just 15 days price protection policy), how come any product becomes less by $50 in just 15 days, it is pure nonsense and illogical by Google.
---
tablet|No thought was put into the product past how to try and bury the Kindle. Now they offer 32 GB for what I paid for a 16 GB a month ago. Just goes to show how cheap the tablet really is and what Google is really all about-it certainly is not about development of a nice overall product. At least Amazon and Apple do their research before releasing new hardware. Google is all about the fast buck not the customer. I will never buy from them again!
---
tablet|You will be very disappointed if you need flash support. Games like Doodle Jump, Mega Jump, Pacman not supported. Angry Bird works but did not try other apps. Adobe stopped supporting flash from 4.1 onwards. Until or unless if there is no Flash in Android for me Androids will lose all his competitivity. But and sound is good though. If you have lots of widgets on the screen tablet may stutter. When I turned it on there were lots of widgets there from Google and there was stutter there. As soon as I removed them, stutter went away. It has a quad core processor but I am disappointed because it is not upto the mark. In the end I want to say my Archos 80 G9 does more job than this. Nexus 7 could be a good ereader and for YouTube videos.

tablet|I am legally blind (I can't see text on a white background) and I bought the nexus 7 with it's jelly bean update and pure andriod os hoping that I would be able to see more acessibility options on the nexus 7 and in Google's apps. I was very disappointed to find absolutely no way to change the white backgrounds of Google apps (any apps for that matter on the nexus 7) to black.Chrome, Gmail, Google+, etc., had fixed white background on which I could not see on. I currently own a Samsung Galaxy Note with 4.0.4 and I am able to change backgruond colors in my basic email app ( not gamil) and the browser (not chrome) to a black background. I am able to see on black like many of you can see on white. The reason I wanted to try the nexus 7 was to get a slightly bigger screen to read on.I am very disappointed in this day and age that Google continues to ignore the visually impaired people like me who want to use android devices. I just don't understand the discrimination here at all.Apple is even worse with this regard. I had have iphones since the original and got tired of fighting with them over this issue and putting up with itunes in a white backgound that I couldn't see.I also found the screen on the nexus 7 to be fair with a bit of hazyness.
---
tablet|By the way the quality on mine is great. I'm not going to cry about a small thing. When There're so many plus it does what it suppose to do great with the lifetime warranty if something goes wrong just sent It back. Just received mine today from Amazon with the two day prime shipping for free! Got to love Amazon it change the way I shop always best prices :-)

tablet|Since I use Google for so many things, I really thought a Google tablet would meet my needs.I was switching from an iPad. I didn't use Apple for anything except tablet. Eureka moment: "Of course! I should use a Google 7 because it's smaller and is my native platform!"Bottom line: I hate this tablet. I hate the apps I've loaded. I hate the inexplicable resizing of windows that occurs, randomly.I hate SwiftKeys ... which is a really well-reviewed app, but doesn't work for me.I booted my laptop to answer emails after cursing with frustration at the Google 7.I'm so disappointed because I so wanted this to be the answer for me. Maybe smart phone and laptop are all I need. The iPad isn't bad, and I guess I'll go back to that as a media device (reader, viewer), and throw this Google 7 in the trash.Why on earth must I be subjected to random ads and new games every time I boot? Why must I search the net (using Google!) to find ways to shut down the crap that shows up every time I power up the device?I love the size. I love the concept. But I don't want to learn about my tool, I just want to use it.
---
tablet|Bought this as a gift for myHusband what a disapointment. Because Adobe and Google can't get along and come to some agreement Adobe will no longer update flash for Android, So if youexpect to watch video from a network web site forget it it will not run.
---
tablet|Hold off on purchasing this device if you plan to connect anything to it via Bluetooth. Apparently the latest Android upgrade (4.2.1) has a bug that makes Bluetooth inoperable for at least some people. I could, but not longer can, connect my keyboard, phone and earpiece. Google technical support can only say they are aware of the problem and working on it.
---
tablet|Got a sponge screen, sent it back. Was sent a new replacement, sponge screen - sent it back...for a refund this time. Complete garbage. Disappointed because this a common known defect that SHOULD BE FIXED BY NOW! Ugh. I guess I'll wait for iPad mini.
---
tablet|All I really want to say here is:Be careful. The nexus 7 is likely a great product but there appear to be some shenanigans going on as Amazon is charging about fifty dollars more than the google website. Perhaps they want to discourage sales so that people will choose the kindle fire instead. I am planning to buy a tablet this month and will probably go with the Nexus 7 32gb because they are now offering it with 3g which, due to the gps functionality, seems to be the better option. I wish they had a 3g 16gb option as it would be cheaper and I probably don't need 32gb but they do not have it yet.I was actually going to purchase the Kindle Fire HD until I learned about their charging to remove adds. To me that is just like slapping a customer in the face. Rude to say the least. I really liked the Kindle Fire for the price and the fact that it has a micro HDMI cable slot so we could connect it to our TV, but won't be getting it because of Amazon's silly idea to put commercials on it.So if you want a Nexus 7 just go buy it from the google website.

tablet|I reviewed and bought the Nexus 7, but then spent more time looking into the latest Tablets and found another new tablet at Amazon reseller TabletSprint called the Novo 7 Flame - which is a tablet less known in the United States - but overall offers a much better and more complete product compared to the latest Nexus 7, Kindle Fire HD, and Nook Tablets-- based on both user experience and looking at the major features of each of these products.TabletSprint seems to be the only US reseller right now of this new tablet.The maker - Ainol Electronics is actually an award winner for "Best Tablet of the Year" 2012 at the industry annual consumer electronics trade show (CES) held each January in Las Vegas - they won for the first Novo 7 Series model, which is a more basic model than the latest in the Novo 7 series.The Novo 7 Fire / Flame has a Dual Core processor that is fast - making web browsing quick; and so is using Apps like a trial version of the new MS Office Suite for Android that Microsoft officially releases next month; as well as using processing-intense programs such as 3D games - which work well with no lag time - based on some of the popular titles I tested out.Another great thing is the Novo 7 offers two high quality camera's - with a 2 Mega Pixel Front Webcam - it's hard to believe all four other major tablets out there skimp out on this feature - Nexus 7, Kindle Fire HD, the new Nook HD only have a 1.2 MP front camera - and Apple is amazingly the worst with the iPad only having a .30 VGA webcam -- the Novo 7 also has a 5 MegaPixel Rear camera for photos and video recording with automatic low light flash and auto focus - Again Nexus 7, Kindle Fire HD, and the new Nook HD, completely skimp out and don't even offer a regular camera - Apple iPad does though - also with a 5 MP one, but of course the iPad costs $399+.One of the nicest features is how simple it is to just plug in to the back of a TV with an HDMI port and watch movies I've downloaded onto the tablet from Blockbuster Online and other movie download sites... which really is the new, easiest way to rent a movie.The Novo 7 tablet's HDMI connection picture quality is the equivalent of Bluray, with Broadcast Quality High Definition at 1080p HD. HDMI is also great for the videos and photos I took with the tablet at a recent family gathering - being able to right away show some of the highlights on a big screen TV using the HDMI connection.The Nexus 7 and new Nook tablets don't even have HDMI, and the new Kindle HD lists HDMI as a major selling point, but it is "half HDMI" with only 720p, not the standard 1080p HD -- so the lesser picture quality is noticeable on a large screen TV and doesn't look nearly as good.When it comes to enough storage space for your files, the big three again limit you since they want you to use their online storage sites to make more money and therefore don't provide the flexibility that a Micro-SD storage slot provides - most people don't always have online web access, so this can be real difficult at times - the Novo 7 Flame has a Micro SD port that takes up to 32GB Micro SD storage cards - if your not familiar with that, they are file storage cards about the size of a dime - much more convenient to put your stuff on.The Novo 7 is also built to last - it's the only tablet made with a thin metal exterior - which really can come in handle on the occasion when you accidently drop it - all the other devices are plastic - much more prone to damage.The Novo 7 Flame has most of the other major features as the Nexus 7, Kindle Fire HD and new Nook HD have -matching the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HD with a high resolution 1280 x 800 IPS backlit screen with wide 180 degree view; along with 16GB memory, Wifi and Bluetooth, and scratch-resistant Corning glass.Another thing that sets the Novo 7 apart is an option for 3G wireless service through many cell phone carriers as well as Ethernet high speed cable connection - Nexus 7, Kindle Fire HD and the new Nook - 7" tablets don't offer 3G - and the Novo 7 also makes it easy to get internet through Bluetooth from your cell phone as well. Only the iPad offers 3G as well.All these things are what make this tablet the most complete device this year - and the Novo 7 does it with a price of $189 -compare that to the Nexus 7 - 16GB device that runs $249, without all these major features added.

tablet|Having just purchased my Nexus 7, I was very excited to get my hand on this first Google-sanctioned tablet; however, my experience with this tablet grew much worse yesterday. After purchasing the tablet, I ordered an Invisible Shield to place on the device to protect the screen. Let me first state that I have put over 50 Invisible Shields on various devices: Iphones, Ipads, Galaxy Phones, Nexus Phones, etc. I am always meticulous about taping off the port holes and openings on devices prior to applying the Invisible Shield. Well, I went through the exact same steps yesterday when applying an Invisible Shield to my Nexus 7, taping off all the holes and buttons. I then sprayed my fingers with the application solution as well as both sides of the transparent shield, being careful to not use any excess. Once applied, I used the squeegee to push out the excess moisture and bubbles to the edge of film while using a cloth to catch/soak-up any excess. After having let the shield dry, I turned on my Nexus 7 to see that liquid had got under the LCD panel all around the edges of the device (And, no, it was not the shield causing the distortion because I removed it promptly). Apparently, the area around the LCD panel is not sealed off as is the case with most Apple products and other Android tablets/phones. Instead, there are porous openings around the screen which readily absorb water like a drain----essentially making any and all of these type of screen protectors particularly damaging to your Nexus 7 device during application. Trust me on this, I was meticulous in the preparation and application. Despite all safeguards, the lcd panel on the front is not sealed as it should be. Avoid wet application screen protectors at all costs. And, yes, I understand that some would claim that this is a flaw with the invisible shield, but it can also be said that this is a flaw with the Nexus 7 itself, considering most retailers carry both the Nexus 7 and the screen protectors alongside one another, underscoring their use in protecting your device. Little did I know that it would end up ruining mine.

tablet|Purchased two Nexus 7 tablets to view flash related content on the web, including Amazon prime videos and flash related content on photographic websites, since it is well known that Apple Ipad and Ipod do not use flash. Unfortunately, after purchase, I discovered that Adobe discontinued Flash for the Nexus 7 tablet.The only way to install Adobe Flash is to hack into the operating system - which voids the warranty - and then download and try to install the Flash player. According to the Adobe website, the Nexus 7 is not on a list of approved tablets and using Adobe Flash can lead to instability problems. The end result is that I can not use the Nexus 7 to view certain photographic flash websites nor watch the movies I purchased as an Amazon Prime member (Note that I do not intend to purchase the Kindle brand of tablets because it also limits web access).Additionally, while the unit appeared to be fast, I also experienced other annoyances, including: 1) it is difficult if not impossible to keep closing those irritating pop up windows on some websites; 2) the type font size is small - and I do mean small - and therefore difficult to read ( I was unable to change the size); 3) the screen does not rotate from portrait to landscape ( I knew about this before purchase but did not realize it would be such a nuisance); 4) sometimes the tablet loads "selections" which I did not select; 5) sites with a lot of content such as CNN are extremely difficult to navigate and read; 6) I could not enlarge the font on the book reader; and 7) the device keeps trying to get me to use Google Plus and diverts my web searches on Chrome to Google Plus which I don't use (I admit that this may just be user error since I have not found the manual yet and have not yet figured out how to limit Chrome on the Nexus 7 to just web browsing and reading).Note, I returned both units.

tablet|I have a Nexus 4 phone which I love, but be warned the Nexus 7 tablet is a totally different offering from Google. Right out of the box, the Nexus 7 did not charge. After hours plugged in the outlet, the tablet does not start properly. I get a static screen or a Google logo screen, then blank. I searched online forums and this is a common defect with the Nexus 7. THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN THE BATTERY GOES TO ZERO. Recharging from zero life battery (either when the battery dies or when the device is new) is not possible for many owners. I've tried Google's suggestions to hold down all buttons for 30 secs and other solutions, but nothing. Less than 24 hours of delivery, I have requested a return authorization. I bought the tablet from Google play store. I'm weary b/c I already received a response mentioning a 15% restocking fee if the package is open. Of course I will fight this until I get my full refund. I want to mention my brother bought a refurbished Nexus 7 and his tablet works fine. His had some battery life from the start, so he has yet to run into this issue. But be warned that even if the device works from the beginning, many owners have run into the charging problem after their battery life went to zero.
