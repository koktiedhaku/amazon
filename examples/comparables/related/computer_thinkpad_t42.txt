computer_thinkpad_t42|This product deserves less than a star rating. It started having a series of problems a day after I received it. It currently goes into blue screen mode maybe 5 or so minutes after startup.
computer_thinkpad_t42|This was the worst I've ever spent my money on. Its a complete disappointment. The battery dies in literally 15 minutes at full charge, there's no wifi whatsoever, I had to buy my own Wifi adapter just so i can even have wifi on this thing, and the windows XP is so outdated, AND the computer is too slow to comprehend simple prgrams, ANNDD it has almost no space to even have music on here. DON'T BUY. You have been forewarned.
computer_thinkpad_t42|This laptop includes the features that I need. However, the whole keyboard seems to be loose. It popped up once andI pressed it down to fit back to the frame.

computer_thinkpad_t42|it is good for me and all i need to do with it..which isnt much..but at times it slows down while on internet but most the time its a great comp

computer_thinkpad_t42|It does not work fails to connect to wireless untill you modify the wifi drivers and add more memory, you need to be expert to install the drivers and memory card buy etc.but with this price it is good I spend another 25$ to buy the memory card and downloaded the drivers. Now it is great computer -ver fast and working without any issues so far.
computer_thinkpad_t42|My nephew needed a computer for his school work...and, of course, to play online games. I was really surprised to received this brand of laptop at the price. It arrived much earlier than I excepted, and it works perfectly. He is thrilled. Thanks.

computer_thinkpad_t42|Service by the company was excellent. The computer must have been too old to handle today's technology online. Had to return it.

computer_thinkpad_t42|This is a great laptop. I didn't buy mine, I was able to salvage it from my school, which was gonna tear it apart for some sculpture project, and I was able to take it home and successfully fixed it.It's has an awesome speed rate to it, I can start using internet in 1min 20sec from pressing the power button (from shut off mode - full boot running Windows XP with 512MB RAM), and I can open iTunes in less than a minute unlike my other computers.The only problem I have is when I try doing too much on it, it will shut off just like a circuit breaker without warning, but this will be fixed when I get a battery for it.Mine has a 1.7GHz Pentium M, 768MB RAM (I upgraded from 512MB a couple days ago), and a 40GB HDD. It works great, and I heard great stories about how well these machines run with Windows 7, and I will want to try updating the OS on it. Hope everyone else is enjoying theirs' just as much as I am mine.

computer_thinkpad_t42|I am retired and my hobby seems to have become setting up a laptop network in my home. (No snickering). I currently have two Toshibas, one Acer, and 7 Lenovos. The Lenovos break down as follows, a T61, a G550 and 5 T42s. See the pattern?? The T42s are favorite and this is being written on a T42. I think they were the best design of the era, great screen, light, powerful, and easy to repair and find parts for. Even drip holes if you spill coffee. Titanium case. Best keyboard on the planet. Best touchpad (touchpad on the G550 sux). Experts will tell you the machine is outdated. They lie. You are not going to edit HD video but you can watch HD with VLC or SMPLAYER. Does virtually everything a new machine does except maybe fancy gaming. And the cost is about equal to a tank of gas. For those of you brave enuf to follow this advice, here are some hints: run XP, its works fine. You can load 7 but you dont need to. Use a tweaker to kill processes you dont need, like XP-Tune. If you need parts, go to Ebay. Cheap and plentiful. Max out the ram to 2gb and put in a larger drive, cheap. Forget about the solid state drives for now, too exotic. Renew the original battery (about $40) if you intend to travel. Also renew the CMOS battery ($5). You can find OEM DVD drives for under $30 if that is an issue. In fact, buy two of these machines, keep the second as a spare.
computer_thinkpad_t42|I received Laptop on time and in excellent condition. It was more that I expected. Worked right out of the box. Even the battery was charged (smile). I am using it right now to write this review. I am excited and will visit this seller again with more orders. Getting some online courses done now will be a snap. Thanks.
computer_thinkpad_t42|I purchased the laptop for my 16 year old son. I didn't think MS Office 2003 would be installed on the computer; I actually upgraded this to Office 2010. The package arrived in a timely fashion and it had meet our expectations. Overall, I very pleased.Thomas
computer_thinkpad_t42|When received, laptop had a faulty DVD drive. They replaced the faulty unit quickly and without question. Very satisfied with the product and the level of service.

computer_thinkpad_t42|arrived early in fare order but wifi wasnt working properly. Ask before you buy, its ok if you wanna use internet at home, but if you use or need wifi in coffe shops or restaurants theres no working wifi. 2 outta 5
computer_thinkpad_t42|This is a great entry level laptop for my son. He needed a computer to do simple research and type his papers and that is what this is. He already has his fire hd and touch for video and gaming.
computer_thinkpad_t42|Happy with my purchase , can't beat online ordering. When I recieved it I toyed around with it. my daughter will love it.
computer_thinkpad_t42|I bought this item for a friend and he confirms that the product is in good working condition as was advertised. I am happy for that.
computer_thinkpad_t42|Well i got this laptop for 141 dollars and it was almost perfect. When I opened the laptop it was awesome until I recieved a message from the message center. It said battery charging but consider replacing your battery. I was shocked but at least the new batterys are cheap. So to sum it all up. Good laptop, Fair Pricing, but only four stars because it had a bad battery.
computer_thinkpad_t42|At this price, cheaper than a netbook, the price is great! I did invest in a ram upgrade, but it is still very cost effective. Great shipping too!
computer_thinkpad_t42|The Thinkpad had a blurry screen. I've had it less than a month and now it has crashed and doesn't work at all!
