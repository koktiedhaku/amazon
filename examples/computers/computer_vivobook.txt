computer|Ultrabooks dont take dvds to safe space.but dont buy this laptop , it is probably cheap but it seems good qulity but really isnt. The fan sounds sometimes like some stone is stuck inside. The computer crashes constantly. Is extremely slow when openning programs. Windows 8 isnt the big deal. I bpught it and the first couple days perfect but then i started discovering all the problems and i returned it. It comes without office so youll have to buy it as well as antivirus. Then i bought a mac mini for almost same price , 100 more and is just apple, no complaints
computer|Buy this laptop and has exceeded all my expectations, but was brought HDD 160 GB, and what I bought was 500 gb, must be a mistake, but being in Venezuela is very difficult to make
computer|If you don't have time to trouble shoot BS issues like being unable to attach files to emails (regardless of whether you are working in the crappy &#34;Mail&#34; program or in a brower application), being unable to get emails you have sent out of the outbox in the Mail program, or having the damn thing shut down with a 15 minutes warning and nothing you can do to stop it like a time bomb, or having it unable to connect to WiFi networks for which my phone and iPad have no issues, THEN DON'T BUY IT.
computer|The pc performance is poor. The construction is of good quality. The touch screen works fine. Windows 8 is what it is. I got it in a good price deal. Don't pay more than $450 for it.
computer|I know it has been mentioned before and there are some links in the comment section in the first review for updated drivers but the touchpad is really poor, even with the new drivers. For me, to the point of being unusable without a mouse. Win 8 is terrible, but tats not Asus fault. Im going back to HP and hopefully can find a Windows 7 machine. This one is going to the kids to use.
computer|bought it for a present for my 11 yr old nieceshe loves it so far, and has had no problems with Windows8
computer|The touch pad (track pad) is too big such that a part of my left had is easy to touch on the pad while I use the key pad.
computer|Touchscreen did not work right out of the box. 30 days in the service center now. They are waiting for parts. Never again ASUS.
computer|&Eacute; relativamente leve e de fato a partida &eacute; de alguns segundos. Não gostei do Windows 8, a primeira coisa que faço quando entro &eacute; sair daquela tela cheia de janelas que não se usa e ir para o desktop. A tela touch screen &eacute; boa para algumas situações, agilizando.
computer|I just rec'd the computer (four days late- thanks Amazon!). The OS is so bad that I would recommend against getting the computer for that reason, alone. The hardware seems OK. Pretty solid feel. The screen border is unnecessarily large, giving the computer a far larger size than the screen really dictate.It's too bad. Windows 7 was great: stable, simple, reasonably fast. Windows 8 is low-density information and you can't have multiple windows open. So, you're constantly switching screens. Total PITA.
computer|glitches, has to be restarted consistently, slower than my old hp laptop, has trouble connecting with anything, battery does not last an hour an a half, price was not worth this machine when there are others that do better an are the same price.
computer|This computer is a wonderful little thing. It's just taking me a while to learn how to use it as Windows 8 is so different from the other Windows OS. I will and it is becoming easier every day. This little power horse is amazing, and I love the touch screen. It's very fast and I love the instant on feature.
computer|Small size and touch screen make this a wonderful little netbook which I bought to replace my 14&#34; laptop when it died. I had a bit of a hassle changing from Win XP to Win 8, but the touchscreen makes it easy. I am now loving it!
computer|I got this for a friend and she is happy with this product so I am also, good quality and price
computer|Its perfect for everything that I need it for. Its very lightweight and compact and perfect for school. A must buy
computer|First time I ever got a new computer (there have been many) and I wasn't operating it like a pro in minutes.Beware! When you buy with Windows 8, prepare to buy a &#34;Dummies&#34; book. And make sure to get a touchscreen, like this little beauty--that's what Windows 8 is for--not for mousing and keystrokes.The little computer is fast, fun, very light. Perfect for surfin and light computer work. My husband thinks the screen is too small for movies--I think it's perfect. Crystal clear and sound is fine. It's NOT a gaming machine. I traded down from a 13.3 Toshiba Satellite that is coughing its last breaths and I love. Great little machine for the &#34;pinklover&#34; in your life.
computer|I love this and couldnt be happier! But and there is always a but. The trac pad is awful! Just doesnt work how I would hope, but I just baught a wireless mouse that should take care of the issue. The compute itself is made very well, good design and overall great performance! Touch screen works like a charm!!
computer|The laptop features Windows 8, which is best experienced through the touchscreen. The laptop is fast for everyday applications and gives excellent battery life. Its size is excellent for traveling.
computer|I love the weight of the PC. Has all the features of a full PC. Battery life isn't great and the top is very thin. I already dented it but I assume that's one of the ways they reduced the weight. Books quickly. Windows 8 is a touch slow but not bad. Good bargain for the price.
computer|I bought it as a gift for my teacher from Turkey. He liked it. So I liked it. Thanks for everything you are the best.
computer|Bought this for my wife over the holidays and she has been using it without any problems since. She has used it for everything except heavy gaming and the performance has been great - no slow downs or crashes. The construction is solid for a light PC, and the touch screen is a nice interface. Its amazing how much she uses it as a short cut to the mouse. The only issue is the space bar will only work when depressed on the inner 2/3 of its length. If you tap it on the outer edges, it will not recognize it, so it requires moving your thumb inward a little. ASUS makes a great product and this little guy is exceptional for the money. If you want a nice entry point for a windows 8 touchscreen ultrabook, buy this one.
computer|i love it! the size, the model, new windows 8 gives it an elegant and modern aooearance and its easy to use! Thanks!
computer|I bought this laptop mainly to surf the net, send emails, and manage personal accounts. The ASUS VivoBook has exceeded my expectations. It was easy to set up and to use. I love it!
computer|This laptop is perfect for travel. It is not the most powerful one that you can get but takes care of every day chores of email, internet browsing, streaming video, etc. The touch screen is also very handy and for the price you can't beat it.
computer|exellent y wife love it.very elegant and working super fast.very fast delivery no problems at all.recomended for ladys pink color looks amazing
computer|It's pretty good. The only issue I have with it is the touchpad driver, but that can be resolved by the top review's instructions. Otherwise, A++.
computer|Good for what it was intended. Very useful (for me) due to size. Enjoy being able to carry it rather than&#34;lug&#34; it.
computer|This is a great product!!! I would order this again and again. Can't beat the price either!! Try it !!
computer|Awesome computer. I was actually wary of spending so little but im glad I bought it. it was hard trying to imagine using the touchscreen but its nice to have. the trackpad and gestures are great. great size. very nice build
computer|If you can get past learning Windows 8 this is a nice pc.The touchscreen is cool and my wife uses it alot.This pc is very portable.
computer|Great value. Plenty fast.Don't waste time trying to find anything cheaper. I have had no issues the first month and have loaded tons of stuff.
computer|Touch feels good for laptop more speed for processor would be better.no choice for colorsleep mode also good
computer|Very light,Mobil ,to carry from room to room. Very fast ,screen is crispy. The speaker is loudsy, I can not hear. The support is dead by waiting time. 4 gb memory has barely 2 at opening as I see.
computer|the laptop is as described - small and light and has been fun to use and has lived up to expectations
computer|When buying a computer from a manufacturer there are some setbacks due to their nature of moving goods. We had a bad Hard Drive that had random symptoms of bad sectors. Support has to go through their protocols. I am not new to computers and I have built newer and fixed older systems. Be sure to let support your level of expertise or you may continue to have issues. The computer was sent back to Asus and it came back within a week of sending it. All laptops come with backup built in your main drive now! It makes troubleshooting even tougher. I do not like all the extra partitions it came with also. The backup partition was Fat32 but the others were NTFS. Support sent me a windows 8 ISO file so that I could make a recovery Disk. I recommend that you download off Microsoft's website &#34;Windows 7 USB/DVD Download tool&#34;. The ISO file is not bootable and you need this program to make it bootable. This does work for Windows 8 ISO file. The notebook is very light, the size of the screen is not that small and it seem fine for overall computer work. I am not a fan of windows 8, I don't like bouncing back in fourth from desktop to tablet mode. The tablets are good for what they are made for, I not convinced why windows 8 has to mock up as a tablet! Tablet games are very simple and retro for what they have. My custom built Desktop rates at 7.8 on the PC rating system and the notebook rates at 4.4. If your not familiar with the rating 8 is the highest rating. 4 stars because it is a nice piece of high tec. My wife rates it 5 stars.
computer|This was a nice product but not what I was looking for. It has all the features that was advertised but it was too small and did not have what I needed. I required a dvd burner and some other features that were not available on this computer. This was a notebook not a laptop.
computer|Almost a perfect Windows 8 ultrabook once the hard drive is replaced with an SSD. The only deficiency that remains is that it has a short battery run time on a fully charged battery. A fully charged battery last only about 3 hours.
computer|I was excited to get this computer; however, as soon as I started the computer the touch screen didn't work. I called customer support who said that I would have to complete a full system reboot, which I did, and it didn't work. I called them back and they told me that I would need to send the computer in for service...and that would take 10-14 business days. I bought it brand new and couldn't accept the fact that I had to send it right back in and not have it for weeks. Besides the touch screen issue, the computer would not shut down, even after selecting &#34;Shut Down.&#34; Each time I have to force it to shut down. Overall, the entire experience with this laptop has not been pleasant. It may be worth spending the extra $$$ and get a better computer.
computer|I love the size and function of this speedy little laptop, as well as the touchscreen, but Windows 8 is just plain nasty. Wish I could revery to a previous version.
computer|Almost brand new Asus Vivobook and the external keyboard stopped working. I emailed support and instructions were too confusing. I was told to reboot, wait for Asus Logo and hit F2. It never worked. Links for replacement drivers never worked. I called support. Was told to hit F2 before Asus Logo and install defaults, save &exit. Downloaded drivers ATKPackage_Win7_Win8_Z100025 and KBFilter_Win8_64_Z1005 and installed. Keyboard still dead. It works at log-on to enter password but not once windows loads.Do I return it?Update: It has been returned.I was using a Motion LE 1600 tablet and I found the pen very easy to use. My son bought the tablet used and refurbished it for me. I loved, loved, loved it! During the election, I wore it out. It finally died November 5, 2012. I have been looking for something that with the capabilities of the Motion tablet but was lighter and didn't run so hot. I choose Asus because I have an ASUS motherboard in my PC and I've found their equipment to be reliable and their service to be excellent.One other problem with the Asus Vivobook was the on screen keyboard (the reason the other keyboard was so important). Because it had to accommodate for fingers, the keyboard took up half the screen. I could never see what I was typing. Touch is interesting but I prefer my pen. Flipping past the apps makes a good commercial but it just makes you dizzy.My next try will be an AsusVivo Tablet with pen. We'll see...
computer|Nothing wrong with this, i just decided to exchange it for a faster model. It is a nicely built, solid machine, well thought out.
computer|Very versatile small notebook, the touch scren is very responsive and the overall system is quite snappy for its price range. Too bad the battery life is not as good as the rest of the product, I get an average 3h of light use (internet browsing and some Word/Excel open files). Since it's supposed to be a ultramobile notebook, I expected to have more than 5h of juice. Will probably sell this one and buy something else.
computer|This product is GREAT. I love the touchscreen. It starts up quickly and has sufficient storage for my needs. Nice!
computer|I like the size and memory it does more than a tablet in the siame size a little heavier but very mobile
computer|This is a great deal for a computer. Not only does it have Windows 8 installed, it is also a touchscreen along with a touch pad. IT has a 4gb ddr3, 500 gb 5400rpm hard drive with an intel core i3-1.8 GHz processer. It is a great computer for a really low price. You get everything you need in a computer and more with the VivoBook. Most computers now come with a touch screen, and once i got mine I can see what all the hype was about. It is so much more convienent. The screen is a perfect size at 11.6 inches. Not too big and not too small. The graphics are pretty great too. I however have recently become interested in the think pads that turn a computer into a notebook. The Lenovo ThinkPad twist is a great choice. It has an intel core i5 with a 1.7 GHz, same 4gb dimm, 5400 rpm hard drive. The difference is, is that is has a 12.5 inch screen and the graphics are a little bit better. It is also a touch screen both as a tablet and computer which makes it even more convienent. All in all it just depends if you are more of a name brand person or someone that will take quality first.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009MPBFNU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009MPBFNU&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwworkoutwei-20
computer|When I tried to make work the webcam and use the mic, this don't work and I was really disappointed with the seller but, trying to find the righ drivers (nowhere in the web), and squeezing my head, unscrew the back and discovered surprised and relieved the webcam and mic unplugged, I just put it in his place and wala..Sorry for my English.
computer|I switched the hard disk to Samsung 500gb ssd. The laptop now starts in 5 seconds. Right after entering passwords, you can straight go to desktop and open any files or programs you like. It is a blink of an eye. Super FAST. The size of the laptop is what I am looking for. I am a student and I don't want to carry bulky laptop all the time, I want my bag to be light. Now it is perfect for the weight and size. The screen size is just ok. However I always carry along a VGA or HDMI cable on campus and hook up with monitors in school computer labs. Enjoy speed and window 8 on big screen!The only thing I don't like is the screen is very reflective. Even in door light can make the screen unclear. However you could adjust the brightness to the highest and it helps.
computer|This notebook computer is solidly built and works great. I had no problems setting up the wireless and the touchscreen is very responsive.
computer|The 11.6 inch was a perfect size for my wife who had a 15.6 but wanted something a little smaller.The touch screen is a added bonus and works great even with an anti-glare screen protector.
computer|I love the size, the form factor, the screen. But I can only give this laptop 3/5 stars. It suffers from CPU whine which can be very annoying when the CPU is at idle. There are no options in the bios which can be turned off to prevent the noise.This is bios 205. There is no longer fan noise, but CPU whine. Only certain people can hear this frequency so do not expect many reviewers to include the problem in their reviews. It may not be Asus's fault, but I wish they had an option in the bios to disable C1E.Hoping that the next BIOs version will fix this.
computer|The overall fit and finish of this machine is nice, and the touchscreen is an interesting feature. Key problem is the touchpad: 1) It's somewhat unresponsive sometimes - a problem I never had with my previous Lenovo machine.2) When I use Google Chrome I find the screen sometimes jumps to 'full screen' with no navigation on top, so I have to hit F11 or otherwise get out of that mode (seems to happen every five minutes for no reason), and3) Sometimes the screen automatically jumps/shifts to another application without any interaction from me and it can take ten seconds for me to get back to my original window/screen.Also, keep in mind that this is more of a notebook than a proper full laptop, so the keyboard is a little small and can be a bit awkward for typing.Overall, this is a nice machine with some material flaws related to the touchpad that are quite annoying and mouse-touchpad is unfortunately a mission-critical part of the experience.
computer|The size, weight, and price of this device are all in line with expectations. It has performed well and I like that it has the versatility that I need. I wish that there were more choices for ultrabooks with less reflective screens but I guess this is the downside of touch screens.
computer|I've had this laptop for over a month now and really like it. I bought it at a Windows store for $499. It came with a half hour class on Windows 8, a book worth about $20, and a $20 gift card.For everyday home use I believe it is one of the best values out there. It will not play Call of Duty of course, but it handles Microsoft office, web use, and e-mail very well. It took a little while to get used to Windows 8, but now I really like it on this laptop. Windows 8 needs a touch screen to get the most out of it. It's easy to go from the New interface to the desktop. Windows apps are run from the new interface, Windows programs are run from the desktop, just like in Windows 7. It took a couple of weeks to get to know the new operating system. From the desktop it acts just like Windows 7. There are even freeware programs that will bring back the start button if you want a more Windows 7 like experience.The touch screen is very responsive, have had no delays or hang ups. The programs load and respond with no delay. The core i3 3rd generation ivy bridge is powerful enough to run all the apps and programs. It handles photo editing well, I have Corel paintshop pro X4, for heavy editing and a photo app for light editing. Mail, Facebook, Twitter and Netflix all have apps. I can watch 2 netflix movies on a single charge, (I didn't run the battery down to see how long it really lasts). The search function is nice, just start typing. It will search for folders, programs, apps, inside documents, and on the web. Just choose which one you want searched.I can't review the touch pad. I hate touch pads don't use them if something else is available. I didn't notice any CPU "whine", but the fan is audible, but not that loud. The graphics aren't 1080P, but they're still good. I like the power supply, it's small and not the brick which came with my old Dell laptop.With the touchscreen, this laptop has tablet like functionality, but can run PC software. I have an iPad that I never use that cost twice as much as the ASUS X202E. I just couldn't find a need for the iPad, but this laptop fits my needs nicely, at half the cost.Remember, this is a $500 laptop. So you wont be getting a SSD or back lit keyboard, you have to pay more for those. For general use, it will be hard to beat this laptop.
computer|This is one sweet little machine, a full Windows laptop at an incredible price. With amazing sound through the speakers!The Windows 8 "Metro" interface starts to make some sense on a touch screen. Personally, I think MS has a ways to go here, but I can see what they were thinking.If, like me, you install one of the free utilities available to skip Metro altogether, you've essentially got a Windows 7 system with all the under the hood improvements that Win 8 brings, plus touch screen capabilities. I really like getting my hands off the keyboard and mouse, and for some tasks in particular (like scrolling long pages) the touch interface on the traditional desktop works great.All this in a beautiful package so light that you don't hesitate to bring it along. Battery life at ~5 hours is a bit shorter than I'd prefer, and the arrow keys are small, so they take a little getting used to, but I am NOT complaining.The true test, of course, is with the household computer snob, whose usual comment about any laptop is "a Macbook Air is so much better," but who has voiced not a word of complaint about this machine.
computer|I purchased this laptop to upgrade from an aging HP Tx2000. I have a ton of applications, including AutoCad, Simul8, CorelDraw, etc.The new laptop arrived five days ago. So far everything going exceptionally well. All apps have uploaded in Windows 8, The laptop is responsive.Other review criticize the battery life. I have not tested this yet, but I can live with a 4 hour battery.Exceptional value so far.
computer|I picked up this laptop from Amazon along with a Samsung 128gb SSD. I was originally planning to buy a Dell Latitude 10 Windows 8 tablet, but it has been delayed due to driver issues. The word is that the new Atom chips are not really fast enough anyway. I first tried to clone the hard disk to the SSD using some free utilities, but due to the UEFI bios the free cloning programs produced disk images that would not boot. I then used a copy of Acronis True Image 13 and it worked. I am very happy with the results. I now have the equivalent of a touch screen ultrabook for a little over $600. The laptop recovers from hibernation in under 10 seconds. It is obvious to me that the future of laptops running Windows 8 will be to have touch screens. I find that I like using a mouse better in the Windows 7 mode, and the touch screen better in the UI mode. I am very satisfied with my x202e/SSD combination.
computer|I am a fan of computers, and this one just perfects it. Thank you for the discount. Thank you for everything.
computer|It didn't take long to get familiar with it and it is definitely a hit. She takes it with her everywhere already and school hasn't even resumed from the holidays.
computer|Bought it for its size and its speed. Just need this laptop for the basics and it does just that. Great buy at a great price
computer|It is an excellent option but it needs an ssd disk in order to increment the computer performance. Despite of that, it is a good computer!!!
computer|This computer is pretty sweet. Intel i3 processor is nifty. Windows 8 is nifty... once you get the hang of it. Touchscreen is nifty. Trackpad shortcuts are nifty... once you get the hang of them. There's not really a built-in tutorial or anything, and it's not super intuitive, so learning takes a bit of time and research. But it's pretty slick once you get used to it. The touchpad acts up when there are updates, but I think it will probably get sorted out eventually. Also, Windows' app store kind of sucks for the time being. They don't get along with Google, so the few Google apps there are are not very developed, or cost money where they wouldn't on Google Play (i.e. with Android). There is no good Youtube app yet. But I think it will probably get better with time. As a Windows computer, it does everything and more. So yeah, no real complaints here. Rock on!
computer|At first I was dissapointed that the touchpad would only scroll in scroll wheel, not natural manner. I contacted ASUS support and they sent directions to upgrade the bios and touchpad drivers. Now it has the natural mode option and works well. I am not a big fan of Windows 8, but it is tolerable when set up so that apps open into the older windows format, which allows real multiple windows as opposed to the very lame Metro windows. Nice touchscreen. Nattery lasts aroung four hours. Fan runs all the time - pretty quiet, but noticible.Directions for the updates:For your issue, please first download and install the ATK driver from the following link:Version V1.0.0025[...]Then please update the BIOS and Touchpad driver for a try.Please do not power off the device during updating process.I suggest you use the winflash utility(BIOS Flash Utility) to update the BIOS in the windows mode. Please firstly download the winflash utility and the latest BIOS, install the winflash utility, run it and then set the path to the BIOS, then flash.Here are the links:BIOS driver(Version 206):[...]BIOS Flash Utility(Version V2.41.1):[...]Touchpad driver(Version V1.0.36):[...]
computer|Hi,I have purchased this laptop one month ago for my wife and we replaced her 4 year old HP laptop. Its good in shape solid build nice touch screen and keyboard. I like window 8 design and the duel desktop.The issue we found its Wi-Fi disconnect some times and at the same other device on the same Wi-Fi works perfect like my IPhone, internet TV and my own laptop. We never face this issue on any of the device.If some has experience the same issue please let me know the resolution.And the other thing I found ( i would not say it's an issue) its scroll pad left and right click are little bit hard to use.Please let me know if anyone found the same Wi-Fi issue.I did not return it because i know there is solution for the wi-fi issue.
computer|I purchased this laptop for two reasons: price and form factor (size). This machine is a replacement for a 4-year-old Toshiba that was my main day-to-day workhorse. That Toshiba, which had a 1.6GHz AMD Athlon Neo Processor and that I had upgraded to 4 GB of RAM and Windows 8 Pro, gave me a reference point for the performance of the new machine (the one reviewed here). My first impression of the VivoBook was that it was SLOWER than the late Toshiba (RIP). This impression persisted through three reboots (always run Windows/Microsoft Update when getting a new computer!). Specifically, it seemed to me that the hard drive was thrashing (jumping all over the place, audibly), that shutdowns and startups were taking abnormally long, installing updates on startup/shutdown took nigh forever (seriously like 45 minutes for a ~600kb update!), and upon boot, the "shutter" with the clock that first appears that shields the login screen was initially unresponsive, missing the clock for a few seconds. Naturally, this is unacceptable behavior. A little sleuthing enabled me to find the solution.Asus, like many manufacturers of mobile computing devices, has the sad, sad, sad infatuation with creating "value-added" software to differentiate their product. It makes for good marketing, supposedly. The amount of [crud]ware on this machine upon receipt was actually fairly minimal, and some of the utilities looked fairly useful (power management, for example). I therefore skipped my usual habit of automatically uninstalling the included "value-added" stuff until I could evaluate the various utilities. For Asus' Windows 7 notebooks, they developed a utility called "Instant On". As best I can tell, this utility essentially approximates some of the advanced hibernation/sleep/fast start features of Windows 8, which is understandably an advantage in Windows 7. However, this app comes preinstalled, and this laptop already has Windows 8, therefore the utility replicates native functionality and competes with Windows. I can only conclude that the thrashing I noted on startup and shutdown was Windows and the Asus utility competing to save state (think of it like a savegame for Windows). Uninstalling the "Instant On" utility immediately resolved the problem. If they ever offer a Microsoft Signature (meaning vanilla Windows) version of this machine - get it and save yourself the trouble.I will not judge the machine itself based on the junk software that came preinstalled, since this is sadly standard practice in the computing and mobile industry. First, the main body is a brushed metal, mostly machined to shape and fairly rigid. It does not show fingerprints, though I noticed a minor burr on the finish that I was able to remove with a fingernail. The outer shell on the screen is a similar material, but not as deeply brushed, so it is much more prone to showing fingerprints (still nowhere near as bad as glossy plastic). The keyboard is responsive (I have found typing on the chiclets to be no problem), but it is not backlit so working at night is a little more difficult (minor complaint).The touch screen is responsive; however, there seems to be high resistance between the glass and the finger you use. I am not sure if there is a manufacturing film/oil on the glass, or if such a coating is missing and it should be there, but either way, the effect seems to fade with time (as the glass collects skin oils? Ew).Performance is as expected for a Core i3 and 4GB of RAM with a traditional platter HDD. It runs cooler than my old Toshiba, but significantly warmer than my girlfriend's Acer V5 Touch. This machine uses Intel integrated graphics, so do not expect to have an enjoyable experience playing Crysis on this thing. The graphics are more than powerful enough to handle Office, Windows, and even the new SimCity at low settings (if you can log in!).Final verdict: This is a fairly robust machine, well built, and one of the best (only) options in this size. It is a good value for the money; just remove most of the "value-added" software.
computer|worked out of the box perfectly. Just confusing that since Google stopped working with MS and checking the box to sync your google calendar with the email throws the whole thing off. But that is not their fault
computer|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 10 year old daughter. She loves it. the touch screen works well. The computer seems well made. It is fast with Windows 8.
computer|Picked up mine at BestBuy. This is my second ASUS ultra book and I love this one too. The metal edge on the front of this model is kindof sharp, but I found the perfect laptop stand for it to angle it just right! AViiQ Portable Quick Laptop Stand (Black) Get this, you will appreciate it.Putting in a SSD this weekend! Wish me luck!
computer|I am in college so that I needed compact size. This is perfect for me!And this touch screen is fantastic! It's really convenient.Quality is also satified!I strongly recommand it to everyone!
computer|
computer|I really like the size of this computer for the price. It is a well built and does exactly what I need it to. It is lightweight and pretty much an ultra book. The touchscreen utilizes Windows 8 brilliantly. This platform should only continue to grow in the future.
computer|I am really enjoying this computer. I purchased the computer for traveling so I could have a thin/light computer. It does all I need it to do. Perfect
computer|I am a secondary teacher, so what I mainly needed out of a computer was portability. It's size and light weight are perfect for me.I don't need computational muscle; all I use are Microsoft office programs, and listen to music or stream movies. For me, this computer is perfect. I do notice the lack of strength though; my desktop instantly starts Microsoft Office programs, but this one takes about 10-20 seconds to open.A pleasant surprise was how handy the touch screen really is. Right in class I can zoom into pictures and slide from picture to picture. It's fun!
computer|first time having at a touch screen laptop it meets expectations. Touch Screen is also apparently compatible with online games if the mouse/finger touch thing is required to play witch i found pretty cool.
computer|I purchased this laptop with the mind set of carrying it around and it is light enough to do so yet it ran faster than I expected from a core i3 class CPU.
computer|I replaced an old netbook with this computer and it really is functional. The touchscreen makes windows 8 more palatable.
computer|Purchased for school and has been great. Bought 3 weeks ago and the only problem I have had was not getting distracted by all the extras and games and focusing on my school work. Battery lasts about 4 hours with heavy use. I have seen many people complaining about windows 8 and I can only assume that they were not using a touch screen. I actually like Windows 8 but could understand someone not liking it if they had to use a mouse to perform some of the functions like scrolling through the start menu.
computer|Bought this little computer from an online retailer. Heard a lot of negative things about Win8. While I am still learning the new system, I am very pleased with the performance. Win8 is a winner with touch screen. Vivobook X202E would be a real winner if you replace the HDD with a SSD. After the replacement, it is quiet, fast, and it opens up extremely quickly. The built quality is great. Much better than my Dell XPS 1330 which felt flimsy and noisy when I first bought it.Downside: screen is not ultra bright. But it works for most situations. I wish it has an i5 cpu.Unless you play with a lot of computing intensive programs, this is the right computer for you.
computer|Lightweight, compact, good finish, touch is very good. Overall it meets my expectations. Though it sometime lost wifi connection automatically when new, contacted Asus customer care, they asked me to run some patch. Its working fine now.
computer|I bought this recently for my teen, was not really expecting much given the price I paid ($424)...but WOW! Put it this way, I have been using a MacBook pro for the past 4 years, and this thing blows me away. Window 8 is nice with the touch capability this computer has. Size, keyboard, navigation and overall quality are amazing for the price. I am very impressed. Great buy!--Happy customer!
computer|Great little laptop all-around - nice form factor, responsive touchscreen, and more than enough for basic computing (web, email, music, movies, basic document processing) without any additional upgrades like SSD or RAM. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the screen is just a little dim. In any case, great deal at this price point, and my wife is very happy with it.I'd like to emphasize &#34;basic computing.&#34; Don't buy this if you are looking to play high-res games or run any other kinds of heavy jobs - it lacks the necessary resources, and you will need to spend more money.
computer|NOTE: I ended up returning this laptop due to issues unrelated to quality of the unit.Addressing some of the subjective items that were important to me:Noise level: 9/10 Very quiet. Don't hear anything except the slight whisper of a fanTouch screen: 8/10 Not quite as responsive as my Samsung tablet, but not enough to be irritating.Screen cover: 4/10 Extremely reflective. Annoying glare.Keyboard responsiveness: 7/10 Had to adjust to this keyboard by pressing a bit harder on each key.Keys: 9/10 Slightly engraved, so key &#34;paint&#34; should hold up better.Touchpad: 10/10 Excellent responsivenessHeat: 10/10 Stays cooler than any other laptop I've ownedAppearance: 9/10 Doesn't look or feel &#34;cheap&#34;Speed: Speed is generally relative to the components inside. Unit doesn't have a lot of &#34;bloatware&#34; to bog down speed.OS: Windows 8. It is what it is. It isn't proper to rate any computer badly because one doesn't like the operating system. But, in fact, I've found Win8 to be a good upgrade, especially in boot time.Would I recommend this laptop to friends? Absolutely.
computer|This laptop is no joke. We're talking a device with full Windows 8 that in addition to the Windows store apps runs real Windows XP/Vista/7 applications, not the gimped Surface with the gimped Windows RT OS that is not compatible with the old programs. We're talking a touchscreen laptop to make use of the touch capabilities of the new OS, not some lame Windows 8 ultrabook without touch. We're talking a device with an Intel Ivy bridge, core i3 processor that smokes, not a gimmicky tablet with a slow, cheapo Atom processor recycled from a 2 year old netbook.The other devices that match the Vivobook cost twice or three times as much (e.g Lenovo Yoga 13, Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro, Sony Vaio Duo 11). These other options cost so much more because they include luxury items like core i5 or i7 processors, solid state HDDs, and digitizer pens that aren't needed unless you're a hardcore gamer, or graphics designer. There are a few Windows 8 tablets such as the Acer Iconia and Lenovo Thinkpad 2 that have equal or lesser specs than the Vivobook but cost hundreds more simply because they are tablets and people will pay a premium for them. And as previously mentioned, the heavily hyped Surface is inferior in hardware and OS to the Vivobook, yet also costs much more because of the novelty of being a hybrid tablet device. So don't fall for the hype! Don't overspend! For those who want all the essentials, but do not have an extra $500-$1000 to burn, the clear and sensible choice is easily the Vivobook.
computer|Have had my laptop now for a little under a month. I was a little reluctant at first, because of the size of the screen, and wasn't sure about whether I should purchase. But turns out, the size fits perfectly in my lap, and I can move it around with one hand or balance it on its side and so on.For my purposes of heavy interneting and word-processing, it has worked great. The touch-screen is amazing for Windows 8 and I honestly don't know how I've functioned without one. I use the drawing app all the time and have fun.The machine itself does have a low fan blowing noise, but I don't notice it at all. It's compact and a I can bring it around with me. I was debating getting a tablet, but honestly this worked out much better for me.Highly recommend!
computer|I had this laptop for about a week now and I absolutely love it! I was looking for a small affordable laptop and this one happened to be in my price range. Surprisingly it came with a touch screen which is pretty much mandatory for getting full use out of windows 8. I've had no problems with it so far, The included Asus utilities are pretty useful (instant on, smart gesture, tutorials, etc). The screen isn't as high end as an Apple's, but then again, this is half the price. The HDMI port is a lifesaver. The only thing I don't like about it is that it has the headphone jack combined with the mic jack so it's either one or the other. But overall, it's a 5 star product in my book and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a laptop at this size in this price range.
computer|I have been pleasantly surprised by the ASUS laptop. I have found it to be snappy, lightweight. I am a software developer, so I have been able to install VS 2012, SQL 2012 and IIS and use them for some light weight development. The complaints I have are the following.Its to glossy and reflects a lot of light.The viewing angles aren't that great.The touch screen could do with a bit more tinkering.The track-pad is very sensitive and takes some getting used to.Windows 8 Pro should have been installed by default or easy upgrade option.If you looking for a lightweight, comfortable laptop that can handle most of your daily tasks with ease, and also play Minecraft than go for this one.Finally a note to the manufactures. If you can perfect this form factor with a detachable or slide-able keypad and keep the cost around $499 you will have a winner.
computer|This laptop is exactly what I've been looking for in terms of price, specs, and form factor. The fact that it was a touch-screen made it even better. The i3 is slightly under-powered without HT, but it does just fine for my purposes of mostly surfing, listening to music, and writing. I'll eventually upgrade to an SSD, but for my purposes, it hasn't been necessary yet.
computer|I've only had this notebook for about a week but so far I'm very impressed. I have had three laptops in the past and currently own two tablets and the Asus notebook is by far the most effective one. I purchased this notebook at my neighborhood Frys Electronics and I was a bit hesitant at first because I had no experience with Asus products. I was deciding between a Sony notebook and the Asus notebook - which was priced $200 less than the Sony. Both were touch screen, had Wondows 8, and. 3.0 USB - all of which were on my &#34;must have list&#34;. After playing around with both of them, the Asus won my heart and here's why:The touch screen is highly responsive.The start up time from shutdown mode is literally a matter of seconds.Navigating the system is very user friendly - thanks to the Windows 8 software.Just as effective and powerful as its competitors who are made by more well known manufacturers such as, Sony, Apple, and Dell.It's small size comes in handy, especially since I have to lug around binders, my other tablet, and textbooks all in one bag.I have no complaints as of now, but I will keep you all updated if I encounter any.
computer|I ABSOLUTELY love it!Great, compact, light weight laptop, about the size of a folder which makes it great for school!
computer|It a good computer but the windows 8 is a challenge. I would buy again as the computer itself is well built but would consider not getting one with windows 8.
computer|I've been dreaming for a Windows touch screen, and this is my dream coming true.To begin with, the Asus x202 is a well-built laptop. It's so beautiful that it's almost a consummated art work. The laptop is light (2.9 lbs.) and with a good price ($549). The touch screen is responsive, Windows 8 run flawlessly, came with a 500 G drive, partitioned into two drives, C: and D:. Office 2007 work beautifully with the touch screen.Another nice feature is that with the I3 Intel third generation processor (Ivy Bridge), there is almost no heat emitted. No matter what program you run, it just get warm, never get hot.I would highly recommend it to anyone.
computer|I was able to update the X202e to a 250G Samsung SSD drive. The increased performance is outstanding and almost unbelievable.I could not clone the factory 500 Gbyte drive. Most cloning software will not work like Acronis etc. They get upset with a Win 8 partition on the system (GPT?). I may have that name incorrect. I tried for three days without success and felt it was mission impossible.Microsoft Windows 8 has a binary backup and restore function. Look at the Win 8 Control Panel to find it. I tried dozens of time to use it, but for some reason all backup's failed using the Asus 500 G Drive. Not sure why this function will not work. When I installed the SSD drive the Microsoft 8 built in binary backup/restore worked 100% the first time. Strange!I finally did a new clean new install on the Samsung 250G SSD drive using a USB CDROM. I used a Microsoft Win 8 install DVD the install was so clean and simple I concluded this is the only method to use. I found a lot of strange things happen with the initial install. Of course I needed more drivers.I then went to the Asus Web Site and downloaded all drivers. There were about 20 drivers. Once installed as far as I can tell everything works as the laptop comes from the factory. Of course none of the 3rd party software was there. That's OK with me.Now looking for a replacement battery. Found one for $115, will wait on this. Saw a Youtube Video on CPU update. This looks very easy to do.This X202e sure is a great hardware platform for updates and upgrades.Hope this helps, Clay
computer|I'm not very I enthused by the apps on window8 on the Vivo. Some apps are great while others are subpar. When multiple apps are open, the system begins to run slow- most importantly I cannot figure out a way to quit the apps without shutting down the computer altogether. I like the touchscreen a lot. But for the money I paid I should've bought a tablet instead or another laptop. I bought the Vivobook because after much research I decided that it might be the best alternative to the MacBook Air without paying the price for a Mac. I almost regret not spending the extra money for a immaculate product instead of settling...
computer|-product arrived quickly and on time-Windows 8 difficult to use-not much information in user manual-not user friendly at all
computer|I was very excited to get this laptop. Unfortunately the horrible wifi ruins the laptop. The wifi is either slow or gets disconnected from the network. I have several other computers running on the same wifi without any problems.I have search online for a possible resolution, but I found no solution to the horrible wifi.I would return this laptop if I could get a refund.

computer|I had problems with this computer right out of the box. The touch screen did not work at all. IE repeatedly crashed as soon as I connected to Wifi. The touchpad was very erratic, sometimes responding to multi-touch gestures and sometimes not. The Windows 8 OS interface was very clunky and hard to use. I found it odd that the escape button did not work to take you out of the full screen apps. Also, it seemed to me to be very slow - perhaps it was the bloat of the annoying W8 interface. Keep in mind that I have only had the computer a few hours. I called ASUS support and they said it sounded like a hardware problem and that I should send it in for service... hmmmm, I think not. This thing is being returned immediately for a refund. Might as well get a cheapo Chromebook since it appears that anything in this price point (especially touch) is going to be garbage anyway.
computer|ive had this since christmas and if your thinking about buying it... dont. ive had good quality products from asus in th past and i thouht this would be the same but i was way wrong. completely aside from the fact that windows 8 is probably the worst os since blackberry (and thats really, really bad)the laptop itself just blows. the touchscreen and touchpad randomly go out after just a few minutes of use and i have to constantly restart it which then takes another 10 minutes to boot up. im typing this review from this god awful machine right before i pack it right back in the box and send it back where it came from. i dont usually post reviews but this just deserves it and hopefully i will save someone the trouble i had
computer|I thought I would luv this little laptop. It's small, has all the usb ports, etc. and it has the touch screen with Windows 8.Problem 1: Unfortunatley, even after a couple of days of trying, the apps I need, still haven't downloaded. When I unistalled the apps so I could reattempt it told me I already owned the apps. So at first it seemed I was screwed. Then somehow, don't know why, they miraculously reappeared in my install screen again. STILL waiting to see if they will download correctly this time.Problem 2: Same problem with my last laptop. Whenever I press the shift key to Captilize something, my letters seem to Miraculously cut and paste themself sumwhere else in the paragraph. NOT a setting that I customized it to do. It just does! This is very frustrating even when you are just trying to type one sentence.Problem 3: Touch Screen Sensitivity. I have already lost pages of data because I accidentally touced something somewhere else on the screen. I wouldn't recommend using a program like WORD that does not automatically save your work when you type.Luv the small & convenient concepts but not very usable as is.
computer|ASUS has the worst customer service in the industry. opened the box and tried to register warranty. Kept getting error message. Called 800 number. 30 minutes and two reps later, they told me I would need to send an email to someone. This requires re-typing the entire error code I kept getting . AND the second representative who was supposed to be a supervisor was less informed and more rude than the first cust rep.Never purchasing another ASUS computer. This is my second one and I should have known better...
computer|Looks so nice and the size is great, BUT... simply way too slow due to a lack of power under the hood. Apps take FOREVER to start up. Ripping a simple DVD using DVDFAB took 2 hours where usually on a pc it took 20 minutes for the same DVD rip. And no DVD drive, so you need an external USB DVD (which is fine and not the issue). But THAT is how slow this ASUS is. Despite all the nifty features, it just cannot handle much more than simple web browsing. And even that can be a pain. Yes, I sadly had to return this. Lack of power makes it pretty much dysfunctional.UPDATE: In all fairness I will rephrase the meaning "dysfunctional' to state "dysfunctional" for power hungry applications.
computer|Bought right before thanks giving from Staples at the same doorbust price of $450+tax.. Staples is selling for $550 and I got a $100 off coupon... sweet deal..as i am looking for a small book for my wife as her 2yrs-ish HP laptop's screen went black..(HP sucks, stay away from it, so does dell).I bought this book as the value of a small screen, &lt;3lb, touch screen, and the over promoted WIN8... this is the cheapest touch book in the market. so it's nice, right?Asus has very good built quality. The machine is very nice, looks fancy and in trend. keyboard, screen, buttons are all good. Really liked it, just the battery is integrated so not easily to be replaced(can be done though) and a 2 cells will not last as long as some bigger ones but not too bad: 3.5 hours per it indicated for normal use(as the display shows).Charged it and turned on, win8 got its first run on this machine...then the nightmare started: used my live id to create an account to log in.. ok, though i do not like this but win8 claims it is required to download the apps from its win app store.. oki...first thing i tried is to launch skype... the app asked me to upgrade to the new version before i can use it..fine. click and brought to the store... installing for seconds the reported error with error code. from there i worked whole night and tried all the tricks folks posted online who ran into same problems, never worked out...also used the new IE, slow, does not play youtube smoothly, the GUI stucks from time to time, and let me put this way: win 8 sucks and by browsing many earlier adopters blog, I know I am not along and microsoft has been just like a large company: keep silent on all these and slow to respond.Microsoft as the world largest software company, is that your latest and coolest OS? Shame on you.You are 2nd Dell and many other company, going down as fast as you can...I returned the laptop after 2 days and the store associates said: we heard a lot of bugs with the new OS, win7 is better. do you want to consider a win7 laptop?" Nice, I appreciated their honest advice and we are moving to apple though it cost more than double to get a Mac Air book. But it does everything solidly as you expected and you buy the peace of mind and quality and service...Feel bad for Asus who built such a nice little machine but its software vendor totally screwed up the game... Now I know why Staples gave $100 off on and only on win8 laptops but not others..as they realize it is a bad deal and want to unload all of them, at least the first win8 version with BUGs.So stay away from the best new OS: Win8.
computer|Very pleased.....seller was fast,,,,,,,,,:) As described. light and easy to use. Will take on vacation and look forward to using.thank you
computer|Still getting use to Windows 8, trying to bend it to my will.I purchased this computer for its portability and touch screen. Have been going to many meetings and needed to keep meeting notes organized. This computer meets that need. Wanted a touch screen because i have issues with every mouse pad I have ever used and the touch screen does work better, not perfect, but better.
computer|An awesome machine. I've had it for severl months. Great for travel. Fast boot. Great battery life. Easy to carry and it just plain looks sharp too. On battery saving, I can do word processing, stay connected to wifi and spreadsheets for 6-7 hrs.Keyboard is only complaint. Looks like an apple, doesn't work like one. Need to adjust your typing style to make it work- more getting used to than I'd like. When I have heavy duty work, I use an external KB since I type FFFAST. Others dis the touchpad, mine works great. I tuned it to my liking, anc changed the "active" area to solve problems with inadvertent activation. Gestures work well, scrolling is fast. Once adjusted and accustomed to it, I like it.Shiny display makes it tricky to use in bright sunlight. Surprisingly it is bright enough on full power. (not bright enough on power saving mode) WIreless net card and bluetooth work flawlessly.The B&O sound is ok, but I was not as impressed as the reviews. I guess I'll still have to carry my ghetto blaster. (this doesn't play cassettes either)Internal microphones and camera work fine.Charges fast. Mini Video plug and Mini HDMI out are similar size. Power and video connectors seem a little fragile, but are working so far. Solid state boot is the only way to go.
computer|Great Product,Seamless, easy to use. Good price, i'd recommend it to others. As mentioned in earlier comments, the touchpad drivers need updating, but after you do that, its one of the best investments you can make at this price.Difficult to find a case/protective covering for it, and battery life is just average.
computer|Its good solid laptop / Touch enabled.But Viewing Angles are very poor outdoors.You can not use it in Car. I am unable to see screen properly while traveling.Otherwise good laptop with Windows 8.Keyboard is little squeezed up, Some keys ( Back Space and Tab) are lost occasionally .Battery life is just so so,Could be improved.
computer|For the notebook, and the seller (BestDeal Tech), I give 5 stars. I am thrilled with this notebook's compact size, the sleek appearance, and ease of use. the keyboard and the touchscreen are great. I can't seem to consistently "click and drag" or "right click", but if I need those, I can plug in an external mouse. So it isn't a big issue for me. I've read some comments complaining about the noise, but I find this notebook to be very quiet, even quieter than my husband's 3-yr-old laptop.I purchased my notebook on 2-21, and received it in 3 business days. Excellent turnaround time! I went online to my orders to look for answers to questions I had on this device (software related), and noticed the price had dropped. (By this time, the device had been in my possession less than 4 days) I contacted the seller via amazon's "contact" button, to ask if they would refund the difference, and they did! Promptly, cheerfully, no questions or problems. I am quite happy with their service so far.The only drawback I have, is with the Windows8 OS itself. I'm sure there's a learning curve. There certainly is for me. I will not call my self a techie...upgrades are probably not a DIY for me. I intend to get help from someone I know, to upgrade the harddrive to an SSD at some point. Win 8 crashed on me--the whole computer beeped and shut down completely, when I had only two tabs open on Chrome. I'm sure this is a fault in the OS, not of the laptop itself, based on what research I have done. This, when my notebook is less than 2 weeks old. There are aspects of the tiles that I like (for example: the calendar, the "desktop" tile--which brings you to the more traditional/familiar layout, but it feels like Win8 was rushed to the market, not unlike Vista, and could have used a bit more time before being released to the market.
computer|Ok so I have had this for a couple of weeks. First impression is of something pretty well built. For the price it is quite good.Windows 8 is quite a pain I have to say...I'll get better I am sure when I discover all the short cuts to navigate/open/close tiles...but it is not intuitive. That has nothing to do with the computer however.The only thing I am disappointed by is the battery life...3-4 hours is pretty sad. That's why I give it only 4 stars.Pros: Price!!! weight, size, built, sound.cons: battery life, Windows 8, touch screen ( yep, you'll have your screen filled with fingerprints in no time...and I do wash my hands a lot...I hardly use it anymore) lack of back lit keyboard.But i am happy with the purchase and for te price, gee, can't beat it.
computer|
computer|My daughter has all she needed now with this computer. The touch screen is great. She is ready to go back to school.
computer|This laptop is underpowered for Windows 8 and the battery barely lasts a few hours...Otherwise it is a good laptop and for the price a very good one indeed !!
computer|I picked this up on sale at an outside site for $379 which was an amazing price for what you get. The touchscreen is good. The sound is much better then my iPad 3. The keyboard is ok but I wish it was backlit. The touchpad is good. Windows 8 on the touchscreen is much better than IOS 6 on my iPad 3 64GB at less then half the cost. The ports blow away the iPad and make the machine so much more productive. The weight is good as I can hold it with one hand. If you can find it on sale like I did grab one. I have not done any of the upgrades yet but will probably put in an SSD drive to speed up boot times which are not too bad but I am spoiled with SSD drives in all my desktops. The wireless has worked fine at home for me but has been a little flaky at work so I may replace the wifi card.
computer|I just bought my Asus from best buy because I wanted to be able to pick it up the same day. This little laptop is awesome! I'm coming off of a SONY VAIO so to be honest I didn't know if there would be much of a difference between the i5 and i3 processors and I was a bit nervous. But this laptop works beautifully. The track pad and touch screen are both very responsive. The webcam is awesome as well! I like to video chat a ton and I will be going abroad so the webcam was a big deal for me. The design is very slick. Very sturdy outer Shell (feels like a mac). I really like that word check comes automatic with anything your typing. As type right now any word that's spelled wrong is underlined! I love that because now I don't have to worry about spelling when filling out online applications! I've only had this baby for a day and I've used it quite a bit but we'll see how she is in a month or so!One kind of con I have about at the moment is the keys. The keyboard is awesome about the spacing and the keys feel sturdy but the texture of them is a bit cheap if that makes any sense. Of course this isn't much of a draw back for me sense the price is amazing!Also for the people that are ify about Windows 8. I will let you know that I am a windows fan and I have had both mac and pcs... I just think windows is more practical but when they came out with windows 8 I absolutely hated it. I thought it was the most impractical thing windows has done. I did not upgrade with my VAIO even though my internship told me to do so. I just really didn't like windows 8. Now that I am forced to have it. I will say that windows 8 works like a dream with touchscreens! (that rhymed ;) I like how its set up to go through and customize the colors to begin with. I'm still going through customizing but as of right now I enjoy the flexibility with it. I also can switch to desktop mode and pan between screens!Anyhow, bottom line. As of right now I like my ASUS, and that's a big deal coming from a college student that has to switch laptops mid semester. A very picky student at that as well. I have it in my head that the only quality laptops are Lenovos, VAIOs and MACs. Hopefully, I can put ASUS in the equation after a month as well.
computer|I bought this to lighten up my laptop carrying. I have been very pleased. This machine is quite fast, very light, and well made. I recommend it for anyone who wants a fast computer that is very portable.Some more details:1. I ordered the Samsung 840 Pro SSD 256GB and cloned the 500GB that came with the Vivo book. Everyone should do that. Samsung makes that easy with the supplied duplication software. I didn't do a fresh install. That would be too hard. I just cloned the disk and it worked perfectly.2. I ordered the Targus USB 3.0 dual video docking station. FYI Targus says they don't make a power tip for the Vivobook yet, so I can't use it to power the Vivobook when docked. But the USB 3.0 is superfast and handles the video, wired ethernet, and all the devices just fine.3. I wish you can upgrade the memory to 8GB, but all indications are the bottleneck in this system is the graphics subsystem.Since installing the SSD, this thing is spooky fast. Boot from power off takes 10 seconds! And I really like the size and weight for portability. I know Windows 8 was made with touchscreen in mind, but hooking it up to a large monitor helps me use it effectively in our office environment. I use the touchscreen when I am away from the office, and I am very pleased with the result.
computer|I purchased this laptop after a long review of different products, after two weeks of use I can say I did not make a mistake, I absolutely love it!!!.It is made of quality materials, hardware and software, (Windows 8 and touch screen make a perfect combination). A lot of reviews say that they changed de Hard disk and installed SSD, I was going to do the same, but decided to try it out first, This machine has an hibrid hard disk and it only takes 8 seconds to startup!!!!so I dont think it is necessary to spend the extra $200.(maybe Ill do it in a couple of years...) the battery last around 4 hours, it is slow to recharge, but I can live with that. other than that I highly recommend it!
computer|Pros: light and compact, including small charger; nice touchscreen; good vendor software, online support, almost no "bloatware"; very nice sound; many available ports for a compact unitCons: oversensitive touchpad; display works best when viewed straight-on and when the charger is plugged-inMany PC tech review sites are giving this a mere "average" rating because it is not the most thin & light compact unit available, and the display & battery life are just average. But let's get real, the top models probably cost twice as much. If you are an average techie consumer wanting a laptop for travel, this is high quality and technically wonderful - way beyond anything at the price. The touchscreen makes Windows 8 something you can learn to like (at least a LITTLE BIT), and quickly became my favorite way to navigate the screen.The I-3 processor and hard drive are delivering nice performance for multitasking web and office applications. I was impressed by the large number of ports available, and pleasantly surprised by the high quality audio coming from the small speakers.As a techie, I will not buy Dell or HP units because they include too much bloatware. Asus is among the better brands for clean, un-gunked computers.This is not intended to be a desktop replacement (I prefer the Toshiba Satellite L series for that, which have I-5 processors, DVD drives, and 15-17" screens at a great price). And I suppose a very frequent travel will want to spend more for a premium compact laptop.
computer|Amazon The shipping was fast, I love my notebook I 'm glad my notebook crashed because I would have been stuck in the past With my old notebook. the price was great an u did not take advantage of the product markup keeping cost reasonable. thank u.
computer|This laptop is amazing! Boots up in 10 seconds even without a SSD. very responsive touch screen and I love windows 8! The metro look takes a little to get use too but it's simply awesome.
computer|I've had this laptop for a little over a month and I couldn't be happier. I haven't had any issues with software or hardware. It's very well built. Not the cheap plastic case you find on most laptops. Windows 8 is totally easy to use and overall, the O/S is speedy and reliable. I highly recommend this notebook. The only con would be the battery life. It's a bit short. But honestly, I can deal with it because I'm so happy with everything else.
computer|The speakers are good for the size of the laptop. It's a good laptop for word processing, internet browsing, and light gaming. The battery life is decent at about 41/2 hours or so. I use it for taking notes during college classes and it is light to tote around. The touch screen is responsive. I would recommend primarily for college or school purposes.
computer|I love this laptop. It weighs almost nothing. It will do everything my Lenovo I-7 can do except load multiple VM's. the touch screen really shows off the power of windows 8. Everything seems to work easier. I was able to quickly add 5 email accounts to the active start screen email and they all worked, despite the complex security on some of them. I use it now for morning coffee and computer and later it serves as my Netflix movie server. Nice little laptop.
computer|Excellent laptop with a very nice-sized touchscreen.It is lightweight and thin, and the build quality is admirable, not cheap. It has everything I love about the Ultrabook trend, plus the touchscreen which works so nicely with Windows 8. I think it's underpowered versus true Ultrabooks, but the price is great for a day-to-day workhorse.Other than the not-so-blazing speed, I highly recommend this machine.
computer|I seriously don't understand reviews saying it's slow. I've had this Vivobook since November and I ADORE it. I'm on the web ALL THE TIME .. right now I have 8 windows open and it's running perfectly!It may not be as fast as some techy high end device running animations or something, but with "regular use" applications this machine is FAST. Start up is completely instantaneous as it only sleeps in regular mode. When you shut it down completely I'd say my start up is 20 seconds (that's the long guess, think it's less)? I haven't timed it but it's not long for a "mainstream" device.It is clean fun, easy to use, responsive. Touch screen works like dream - seriously! It's SOOO cool to be able to just reach up and flick down the page, or touch a link or whatever you want! I didn't think it would work reliably but it's as good as an android tablet in terms of response. Keyboard is not always my fave, but it's fine. Windows 8 takes time to get used to and I have some issues with it. For the track pad getting used to the windows 8 "smart motions" or whatever they're called takes time but you can disable the ones you don't like. The left sweep motion was to sensitive so I disabled it.... wish you could reverse the scroll down direction to motion, but I use the screen usually anyway. Other than that no complaints and that's a windows thing.LOVE this machine! And for the VALUE... I ADORE IT!!! I've had ASUS before and these things work for years. In fact the only reason I bought another computer my 3 yo asus netbook was stolen. I'll always buy ASUS because they're dependable and have great customer service!I have no affiliation and am not getting paid or anything I just glanced at the reviews when I was looking on Amazon for a keyboard skin. :-)That's itAloha!
computer|- Design: Beatiful, efficient and super portable.- Performance: impressive. I have a Sony Vaio laptop which has also 4G RAM and i3 CPU, but this one is a lot faster. Also very quiet and cool.- OS : In my opinion, Win 8 is a failure. I installed Ubuntu 12.10(64bit) dual boot and never boot with windows again ever since.- Touch screen : Since I do not use Win 8, I barely use the touch function though, you will have some difficulties to use Win 8 without touch screen.- Price : Very good value
computer|Great laptop, especially with the touch screen. This is better than the MacBook air, only it does not have a backlit keyboard.
computer|Small, Light, Beautifully made, great price and surprisingly nice keyboard for such a small machine.Would have been nice to have a SSD with it, but for the price, can't argue with it.It is not a power-house, but it is really nice for a light machine that can double as a tablet replacement and a productivity machine.
computer|Touchpad is a little bit unresponsive at times, but the price is amazing! Especially with a SSD installed, this machine beats an apple macbook air hands down for price and performance.To install a SSD - goto my site for instructions/pictures which is in the comments of this review
computer|I agree with most reviews on the value, but you do get what you pay for. My laptop screen cracked after a few months of very light usage. I brought a replacement screen online and did the replacement myself. After opening up the laptop, what i realized is 1) the case is made of very very VERY thin metal 2)the plastic is of very poor quality and they crack easily. The case was so thin, any bumping or hitting of the lid will possibly result in a cracked screen. Look at it this way, Asus has to cut corners somewhere to lower their price, and in this case, it's a very poorly made "case." if you do want to get this laptop, i high suggest a hard shell case for protection.
computer|I love the sleekness and weight. It looks a feels great. The arrow keys are very cramped. Battery life isn't great. The touch responsiveness killed it for me. I found it to be much less responsive than I would like - nowhere near as specific as my Asus tablet. I sometimes had to tap it several times to get it to do what I wanted.
computer|I currently purchased the laptop and give it 4 stars for a good reasons. First and for most, I want to express how much I love my new laptop. The metal cover on the lap top gives it a sleek, high tech, fancy look which takes the attention away from the 'unknown' asus brand. The laptop gives it an additional glamour and for the affordable price of under 500 bucks, why not? I love how thin it is. I am currently a nursing student and I have tons of books I have to carry with me, but with this thin design, it's one less thing I have to worry about. I am a small guy, and so the keyboard isn't a hassle either. I feel comfortable typing away on my lap top because it doesn't feel like I am playing the piano when I am writing a long ass report. The music is loud enough and clear enough so I can take it anywhere and play my music without having a poor quality sound. The contrast color on the screen isn't bad either, I just wish it were a little brighter sometimes. The cons? Compared to my 10 year old MacBook, it takes a long ass time to load some programs. It's only day three since I've had this laptop and my computer already froze on me a couple of times. Perhaps it's windows, IDK...but I am not too impressed typing away using the touch screen either so there have been some times when I have to still use a mouse because it's faster. The camera on this thing borderline sucks. I won't be using it anytime to take pictures and the whole touch screen idea gets old pretty quickly. Overall though, I totally love this lap top. the pros outweighs the cons and for the price I paid for it, I recommend it. If you are a college student looking for something reliable and lightweight that you can carry anywhere, then this is the laptop for you. Light, reliable, fancy looking and affordable.
computer|I had this Laptop for a couple of months now I Love almost everything about the laptop its not big in size and its very light weight compared to most of the other laptops i've seen it is very attractive looking when i first got it that's what i noticed first so i don't think you would be disappointed with the over all design, it's beautiful. My favorite part is clearly the touch screen i never had a touch screen laptop before and this one seems to be pretty responsive the processor and memory is great. It comes with windows 8 although Some people don't like windows 8 but i personally love it; however, the laptop does have both 7 and 8 so its cool to switch back and forth from time to time. I recommend getting a screen protector since its touch screen your probably gonna to be constantly cleaning the figure prints off your screen without it. I gave the laptop a five star but there is one issue ive noticed with the laptop which is the horrible choice of the fan positioning since they designed the laptop with the fan on the bottom you have to watch where you put it down at because it gets really hot on the bottom when its on and covered. Like i laid it on my couch and since it was still on when i came back the bottom was super hot it hasnt giving me any problems computer wise yet but it still isnt good for it either so thats really it over all i love love love the laptop and highly recommend it :D
computer|For what it's worth, Asus makes very good laptops for the price you buy them for. With tax I bought this from here (on amazon.com) brand new, not refurbished for just under 525$. The only thing I can complain about is the fact that I could not buy a warranty on this item. But, considering how well it runs, I don't think I would need one. Aside from the new Windows 8 operating system, which is more or less a copy of an iPad, this computer is amazing. It is very lightweight and portable, it has a very fast internet operating speed, and best of all, the keyboard is very easy to type on. Usually I try to stay away from laptops that are less than 13&#34; because of the small and crammed keyboard, but this keyboard is very comfortable to use and is very similar to a Macbook Air or Macbook Pro. Although many people complain about the small processor (Intel i3 Dual Core with 1.8ghz) which I agree, seems like it would not hold well when running many programs, is surprisingly doing an amazing job. Although this has a very small processor, you do not need a large one unless you plan on running multiple games and videos and programs that require a lot of processor speed, but either way, the 4gb RAM helps to make up for that. Additionally, the 500gb HDD is a nice touch because it allows for storing a lot of memory. Even the battery life which some people complained about is outstanding. I charged this to its fullest 5 days ago, I used it here and there, probably about 8 hours total. I haven't charged it since and it is still at about 40-50% battery life. Although this will deteriorate over time, it is a very good life span at this point in time.Pros:LightweightCheapWindows 8Fast processor if you use it for running apps such as Microsoft OfficeTouch ScreenGood KeyboardGood SpeakersGreat Battery LifeWindows 8 App StoreCons:Slow processor if you use it for running apps such as games and video production appsTakes a bit of time to get used to the touch screenFan runs if you use apps that require a lot of memory all at onceAll in all this is a very good laptop if you are planning on using it mainly for taking notes in school or finishing papers on the go. It is not a good laptop for home entertainment. The Windows 8 OS takes time to get used to, but it is very similar to that of an iPad in terms of shortcuts, app design and more, it is very useful once you understand it. There is also a special button on the top right of the keyboard which brings you to a dashboard type screen. It displays battery life, hard drive size and memory available, RAM available and more.In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this laptop for any student or anyone who just needs one for finishing papers during lunch. It is a good laptop at a very affordable price and for the past few weeks I have had very little to complain about it.
computer|Wow, this is great. Went to Staples to try it out, but the one they sell does not have bluetooth! Their's was an S202E. This one is the X202E with more features. Sturdy machine and way cool! We love it. Purchased for a gift and it is used daily. Great price, speedy, easy to use right out of the box and convenient for travel. So far it has been fantastic!! Hope it continues....
computer|love it much better then i thought,pro: small light and enough processor ability,con: battery is average, about 3 hours
computer|Let me start off by stating the purpose I bought the VIvobook for. I already have a gaming laptop and needed a small laptop for work that could be used in a car but was fast enough that I don't pull my hair out waiting for things to load. Also I wanted to have a smaller laptop to use in the bedroom or on the couch just to surf the net and check emails or youtube.After some research I narrowed the results down and ended up purchasing the Vivobook. The touchscreen was not a selling feature but something that was nice and that I thought could be useful. The Vivobook is very quick and easily surfs the net and pulls youtube up without issues. I put Office on the computer for usage at work and have no had a single problem either. The touchpad is responsive and the screen is bright and vibrant. The keyboard is not frustratingly small and is comfortable to type on. I am loving my experience with it and if I had to give a con it would be my unfamiliarity with windows 8. I am getting used to it but would prefer 7, I dont utilize the social functions and apps that windows 8 wants me to. The Vivobook is snappy and runs quickly with what I have thrown at it. I haven't tried to play any games on it but as it wasn't my intention I'm not sure that I would try. Overall I would definitely recommend the Vivobook.
computer|I considered an Ipad and Ipad mini but with no flash capability (web browsing) they did not meet all my needs. I also looked at other tablets and ultrabooks.This is close to a tablet but with a full Windows 8 OS for all my apps and a keyboard you can use professionally. I can handle it with one hand and it's light and easy to tuck away. The only thing it's missing is a lighted keyboard. Recommended!
computer|I have a netbook for 2 years which I enjoy tremendously due to its compact design. I'm a small person so it's important for me a laptop that is small but yet powerful enough for my needs. When windows 8 came out I want to get one with a touch screen laptop but within my budget. This is a great laptop for me. It's small, light weight, key size are just perfect for my fingers and audio is good with my headphone. Audio is decent, Core i3 is not powerful but I'm not a gamer and mostly I just use it for web surfing and listening to international radio. I love the touch feature and I don't really notice the lag. I got mine from Adorama for $564 with no shipping or tax. Cool! Definitely a keeper for me.
computer|this is an amazing computer at this price. for what an average person does (internet surfing, browsing the web, word processing), this is beyond great. however, i am a student taking compsci and it does slow down significantly once i'm running vs or mysql server. it also doesn't let you upgrade ram so that's kind of annoying. i'm returning this product but i would definitely recommend it to anyone who just needs an everyday computer.
computer|Update 18-Mar-2013: Wanted to specifically mention that battery endurance is impressive for my usage. I can get up to four hours of web surfing if I needed it. I find that I'm more productive with this computer because the processor and SSD (user upgrade) are quite fast. My morning web surfing episodes are noticeably shorter.Update 15-Mar-2013: I improved the touchpad by installing ASUS touchpad driver from their website and customizing features. The current driver is named SmartGesture_ASUS_Win7_8_VER1036.zip. Once installed, double click the ASUS SmartGesture icon in the taskbar (usually bottom-right on desktop). My preference, YMMV, was to uncheck all features except Select and Activate. I still don't like the touchpad but now it's more predictable. I also changed Control Panel->Mouse->Pointer Options->select-a-pointer-speed a couple notches faster.The ASUS X202e (ASUS S200e) is an excellent value despite its flaws. Here's some tweaks to share. Some require hacker-level experience. I use the X202e mainly for web surfing. Your tweaks may vary with use case.1. Replace the hard drive with an SSD for much faster speed. The processor is quite fast for web surfing but you'll really appreciate the added speed of an SSD. I only need a 60GB+ SSD for my usage. Be sure the SSD is a 7mm height drive such as a Samsung 840.2. I hate bloatware. I reinstalled Windows 8 from a generic 64-bit Windows 8 DVD. No activation key was needed. The only driver I needed beyond what Windows 8 installed was the audio drivers for the microphone. I downloaded from ASUS support web page. I installed using a generic USB DVD drive.3. The default screen settings make the display a bit washed out looking. To fix, right click on the desktop->Graphics Properties->Display->Color Enhancements. Change Brightness to -20, Contrast to 51 and Gamma to 0.9.4. I use Ninite.com to quickly install many often used programs.5. I swear the touchpad has been improved by an initial cleaning. I used window cleaner.6. I haven't found a better touchpad driver than the stock Windows 8 driver. I'm open to alternate drivers. Please make recommendations in comments but please, document any non-standard settings.7. I reset the BIOS to defaults and then chose "Optimal Settings". Don't assume the manufacturer installed with optimal settings selected.8. I love Windows 8 but only when with the Windows 7 shell, so I installed EX7FORW8 software. Recommended. Touch continues to work.With these tweaks, you'll get a much better X202E experience. I'm hoping a new driver will improve the too touchy touchpad. Yes, the screen could be a bit better but it's acceptable. Battery life is ample with my usage. I get about 4 hours web surfing -- more than expected and more than needed for my usage.
computer|I went the same route as a few of the other reviewer, I bought a 256GB SSD for speed, and an intel celeron wifi for WIDI display. And everything worked, so thanks everyone!Overall, the laptop is really nice at $474. An SSD is highly recommended to make it much faster and more responsive. Thats really the only bottleneck of this laptop.Intel 400HD performs well for all tasks (videos, flash) except for serious gaming.After days of frustration, here's how I cloned the HD onto smaller SSD (very simple, free, 1 hour):1) Buy sata adaptor (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064VP73E/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i03?ie=UTF8&psc=1) $10. This allows you to connect your SSD through USB2) With SSD plugged to USB open control panel &#62; Disk management. It will say &#34;you need to initialize the disk&#34; there YOU MUST SELECT GPT (very important, don't select MBR)3) Again in disk management right click on the C drive and select shrink. This will set unused parts of C to be unallocated.4)install Macrium Reflect FREE edition5)Very straightforward to use, when cloning disk, toggle off the Recovery drive (you don't need that one and it is too big to fit on SSD) and copy over the data with default settings. (takes 30 minutes)6) shutdown and take out HD, put in SSD and fire it up. (There are no hidden screws to unscrew, but still the cover is pretty hard to open, you just need to carefully force it.)7) from control panel, disable weekly drive defragmentation (SSDs shouldn't be defragmented)Review on WIDI (not this laptop, but WIDI technology): setup is tedious (download lots of drivers as other reviewers noted). needs to have line of sight to the Push2TV adapter and be 5-10 feet away, otherwise it will keep disconnecting. Decent performance for youtube and netflix (watchable). Lagged when streaming videos through some other websites that use flash plugin.The intel wifi is $30 and a WIDI adaptor is $60. So if you're willing to spend it just to play around with this new infant technology then go for it. Otherwise don't, stick to HDMI cables.Review on windows8: I disabled some swiping gestures from the touchpad tray icon, besides that win8 is fine. people should stop crying, and stop looking for the old windows start button
computer|The Asus VivoBook has incredible build quality and I can't stress this enough. For about half the price of a macbook air, it has just as good build quality if not better. It packs all the required ports including VGA and Ethernet (hidden neatly in a recess). The touchscreen is very responsive and Win8 was built for touch. I found myself using touch even in the desktop mode and it works just fine contrary to all the negative press. The screen res is fine given it's a 11-in notebook and the entire package is very light at 1.3kgs.The downsides are average battery life (about 4hrs) and slow HDD (5400 RPM). If only it had a backlit keyboard, this would have been the perfect portable work machine.
computer|I really like this computer. I was considering this one and one that was a little bigger but I decided to go for this one since it was 2 or 3 hundred dollars cheaper for the same computer basically but smaller. It really doesn't look too small, I'm happy with the size. The windows 8 doesn't bother me, just takes some getting used to. And I love that it's a touch screen. I had to take it to ITS at my school to get it to connect to the schools wireless internet (turned out McAfee was blocking the connection) and they seemed impressed with it as well.
computer|After 4 months of use the keyboard letters w r y and o stopped working. I took the unit to California Computer Center in LA and was told that ASUS doesn't guarantee the keyboard. I called ASUS back and they told me that could guarantee it if a sent it some place else to repair it, but they didn't, guarantee if they would cover the repair. After that I decided to pay to repair it, since it would be faster and I would not be waiting a ASUS information about they paying it or not. I realty don't recommend it.
computer|I agree with the majority of posters that this little laptop is well built and so far works great with a few exceptions: sensitive touchpad, cannot adjust sensitivity, cannot invert scrolling with touchpad, and finally, the CPU seems to run hot. At idle, it runs around 60-deg celcius. At full load, it reaches over 88-deg celcius and throttles itself down to 1600 Mhz. Tested using prime95 and CoreTemp 1.0 RC5.Can people test and post their results in comments for comparisons?Are these temps normal?*** Update (3/13/13) ***Adding wireless network dropping to the list of cons. I have been experiencing WiFi network drops regularly with this laptop. Haven't found an updated driver yet, or figured out the solution yet, but have just been coping with it. If anyone knows the fix, please share.
computer|Touchpad is a little bit unresponsive at times, but the price is amazing! Especially with a SSD installed, this machine beats an apple macbook air hands down for price and performance.To install a SSD - goto my site for instructions/pictures which is in the comments of this review[...]
computer|I bought this laptop for my wife for Christmas and she likes it. She is a light user, email, browsing, some minor Office documents etc. Everything runs well for the laptop, the touch screen is great, and Windows 8 is great. The only things that seem to be lacking at times is the processor and RAM. It can feel sluggish if you open up a flash page that has a large amount of video embedded into it. I think it is just not quite powerful enough for much other than browsing, email, and other light duty. I would not want to run data or large excel spreadsheets on this machine.For a casual user who wants a portable laptop with a touchscreen, this is the way to go.
computer|So far this computer is really good, I am really impressed with quality, and how well it runs. Even impressed with the touch screen.
computer|I had this laptop for about a months. I chose it over Zenbook refurb at similar price mostly because Zenbook does not use standard hard drive. I planned on installing Intel SSD with encryption. Intel SSD 520 series offers transparent AES-128 encryption. This would be sufficient to secure personal information in case laptop is stolen.After the SSD was installed it turned out there is a bug in BIOS that prevents HDD password from being set. Worked around this issues by flipping SATA mode to ATA temporarily and setting the password. After that everything appears to be working as expected - before boot you asked for password, once entered SSD can be used and there is no performance impact. Everything works fine except when it time to wake up from sleep laptop freezes and needs to be hard reset. After restart there is no indication of what happened in the event log. Wasted half day checking every single driver for latest version but no avail. Tried every setting in the bios including disabling deep sleep, SATA in IDE mode (had to be reinstalled), UEFI vs non-UEFI boot. Only after I removed HDD password it worked normally. It appears that after waking up Windows noes not see the drive, therefore no info of any kind in event log. Reading horror stories about quality of ASUS support did not call them instead started looking for alternative solution. Sleep mode on laptop is essential, should be able to just close the lid and continue while after.Full disk encryption using TrueCrypt or like is not an option on this computer as i3 CPU does not have AES features built in making all disk operations very slow (clocked 170 Mb/sec with 100% CPU load, compared to 1.5 Gb/sec on i5). I had Win 7 Ultimate license lying around and installed that. What a relief after Win8 with all the tiles jumping around! Encrypted users folder, created nice secure password and that will do for now, however lack of HDD password support is big disappointment. One star down, waiting for BIOS update so I can enable HDD password again.Another star down is for combination of Windows 8 and included software. Windows 8 does not appear to me a well polished system. Some programs work in desktop mode, some in new 'metro' interface. That alone makes you feel like working in two OS at the same time. That can be fixed by installing desktop version of picture viewer, PDF viewer, skype... Fine. Asus utilities adopted to windows 8, newer versions of them appear to be buggy and not as well polished as for win 7. On-screen icons, power manager, audio... I would not have known that if did not try Zenbook few days ago. After installing windows 7 I just downloaded older versions of utilities from Zenbook support page (same chipset). Much better experience.Overall impression is good, lightweight, enough power to replace home desktop for basic office needs. Screen is not that great but after basic color calibration is half passable. Covers about 75% sRGB which is in line with other laptops. Zenbook had gorgeous 1080 lines IPS screen with 100% sRGB gamut coverage but did not feel reliable. This looks more reliable tham Zenbook for sure. Keyboard is allright, not IBM-like but usable. Battery is as advertized - up to 5 hours. Can't really tell what you need to do to make it to 5, with most aggressive power settings and nothing just internet browsing it's hardly ever gets over 4 before it turns off. I guess after several cycles it becomes bit better. Touch screen feature has limited useability. Maybe it is not the case with windows 8, not sure.Through HDMI it is able to feed 27 inch 1440 lines external monitor. Just need to add custom resolution 2560x1440 and refresh rate 30Hz. Not officially supported but works fine.Standard 11.6 sold at Amazon sleeve fits bit tight, might scratch corners when opening/closing. Got on ebay better one with extra lining.Charger is disappointment, takes longer to charge laptop than to discharge it. Does not maintain battery well. ThinkPads have the feature to start charging only after battery under 90% and stop at 97%, that keeps battery alive longer by reducing number of cycles. This one starts every time battery is plugged and goes all way up to 100%, expect to replace battery in 2 years.
computer|Just recieved this laptop today and I am impressed so far. The main reasons I chose this model is the touchscreen and the price.The build quality is excellent on this laptop(this is my first laptop so I really have nothing else to compare it to). Heavy enough to not want to tip over when adjusting the screen but not too heavy to make carrying it around a chore.The screen is beautiful out of the box, if not just a little washed out.The trackpad is kind of a pain so I'll probably find new drivers for it as some other reviews have suggested. It is very fast overall. Understand though that my last computer was a dell dimension 2400. I don't have alot of screen time on it yet, but it is getting faster as everything gets updated.Windows 8 is going to take some getting used to. As an android user, I feel the interface is not very intuitive. It almost feels like at this point though that Microsoft made a solution in search of a problem. The term "jack of all trades, master of none" comes to mind. I just don't feel the learning curve should be as steep as it is. Maybe I'll get used to it though.OS aside, this seems like a solid machine. Would definitely buy again at this point.
computer|I left a review earlier stating that the multi-touch feature on the touchpad was working inconsistently and that I was sending it into Asus for repairs (they pay for the shipping but you still have to pay for the box and packing at fed ex (17) and also go without a laptop for the week and a half that its with their service techs) and that it returned with the multi-touch feature still not working consistently. It says they reloaded the operating system and replaced the touchpad hardware.So I have to send it in again and go without a laptop (the only computer in the house currently) for another week or so.I think you get a few bad lemons regardless of brand/manufacturer/OSBUTI would NOT recommend this item. And if I could exchange it for a different laptop right now I certainly would. And I probably won't by ASUS again even though I know they are considered to be one of the higher end brands.
computer|When I first turned it on, there was this &#34;clickity&#34; sound coming from the vivobook.I don't know where exactly from the vivobook, but it was near the sides near the fan area. I didn't pay much mind to it since the vivobook seemed to be working fine and I really needed it for my business trip. I was able to turn it on and play around with windows 8 for a couple of days. However, four days after getting Asus, things started going down hill. When I turn on the ultrabook, a blank screen instead of the start screen appeared. It wouldn't start up. After a while and many times manually turning off the machine, I was able to get the start screen back. Then the computer just crashed on me. Thinking back maybe the sound I heard upon turning on the computer could have been a bigger problem that I first realized. In addition the click tap on the touch pad does not work all the time nor the scrolling. I don't know who is at fault. But i would really appreciate an exchange for a new device though.
computer|Excelente producto era lo que esperaba, muy buen dise&ntilde;o, buen rendimiento, la pantalla tactil ni que decir increible, lo recomiendo!!!
computer|I recently bought the Vivobook from Tigerdirect, but through Amazon for $429.99. After first turning it on, the laptop went through the standard Windows 8 setup. The touchpad worked fine and I was delighted to find that two-finger scrolling on the touchpad worked great. Two-finger scrolling can be very convenient for those times when it's not as comfortable to scroll by touching the screen and when your fingers are on the touchpad anyway. As well, the touchpad wasn't overly sensitive, so it did not interfere as I was typing on the keyboard.But then I started getting automatic updates from Asus. Many of them. I would have to restart the computer and wait several minutes for everything to install. This happened three times and after the third time, two-finger scrolling no longer worked and the touchpad was overly sensitive to the point where I could barely type a sentence without something wacky happening due to the interference from my palm being close to the touchpad as I typed away.Also, I was video chatting with my friend when the video feed started behaving erratically, which never used to happen when I used my old laptop to video chat.Keyboard felt kind of cramped, but one can get used to it. The core i3 processor can make things lag a bit when you have several tabs open and a video chat going at the same time. Fan seems to be on constantly. Again, no biggie, one can get used to it. Touchscreen worked great, and I loved the small form factor, and small weight.Due to all of the above (but especially due to the badly updated Asus touchpad driver), I decided to return the laptop. For some reason, neither Amazon's nor Tigerdirect's website had any record of the transaction, so I had to call Tigerdirect for instructions on how to return the laptop. I was on hold for about half an hour before I finally spoke to someone. He told me I needed to call Asus to get a case number and then call back Tigerdirect to get an Return Authorization Number so that I could return the laptop. Of course, I had to wait another half hour to speak to someone from Tigerdirect. In the end, I paid $21 to ship the laptop back to them.So the lesson is: Try to buy the Vivobook directly from the Microsoft Store if you can. My friend got her Vivobook from the MS Store and it has absolutely no issues, no series of Asus updates forced upon you, and no bloatware. Sure, you'll pay a bit more (last time I checked, the MS Store had it for $499), but it's worth it.
computer|The laptop is very well built. I bought the pink one. Super nice color! I love it. I did read other reviewers comments as well. I am planning to upgrade the hard disk and wireless card.I just got it yesterday. I didn't encounter any problem yet. If I do, I will update my comments. After one-day use, I did notice couple of cons you might want to know before you buy.ConsAlthough it only weights 2.9 lbs, it feels heavier.The screen is too glossy.The font is fairly small. But I am glad it is touch screen so you can magnify it very easy.The hard disk makes click noise once a while. I guess it is not big deal as long as the hard disk doesn't die suddenly. I do plan to switch it to 7mm 2.5&#34; SSD from Samsung.Wish the memory can be expanded. Well, 4GB is just not enough for me.Pros:nice buildtouch screen is fine for the pricespeed is fine if you only surf the internet and do documentation.According to my tight budget, I got this one. My future plan is to get DELL XPS 12. The design of that tablet is just great. But it is around 1000 bucks. I can not afford it right now. Save money for the better one.
computer|On the outside, this is a stylish looking laptop, with the shiny lid and chiclet keyboard. The screen is somewhat small compared to the overall size, but this is helpful for Windows 8 gestures. The 768p display is fine for the screen size. Any higher resolution would make touching Windows 7 programs challenging. It is a little thicker than I expected, but still less than 1" in all locations. It weighs about 3 pounds, heavier than I expected, but still very light. The back panel is easily removable with a regular precision phillips screwdriver. This exposes the removable hard drive, wifi card, and battery. The keyboard is slightly small, and were my (average size) hands any bigger, I would have trouble typing. The touchpad is pretty bad with stock drivers, and acceptable with an aftermarket driver (link in the comments). I also have an external DVD burner so that was never an issue for me. I like having an HDMI port to be able to stream on the big screen TV. The power cable could be slightly longer. Battery life is around 4 hours the way I use it- max brightness web browsing. The screen is slightly dimmer than the average laptop. My first Windows 8 experience was on a computer with no touchscreen. I hated it- nothing seemed logical and it was a big downgrade from Windows 7. After returning that laptop for this one, a touchscreen has made me love Windows 8. Still, it was very slow. For years, I have been a SSD user. This was my first hard drive in years, and when I first booted up the computer and played with it, it was very slow. It booted in no less than 30 seconds. Apps take up to 10 seconds to load, and installations take 5+ minutes. The initial run of Windows Updates that happen on boot/shutdown took up to 30 minutes to shut down the computer. So naturally, the first thing I did was attempt my SSD install. It took me a day of fiddling, but I now have it working and WOW. It is night and day difference. If you do not have an SSD in this computer, I cannot recommend it. It will be more an exercise in patience than a fun new touch experience. Luckily, I had a leftover SSD laying around and I installed it (will discuss install at bottom). Now this computer is fun and peppy. If you do not intend to install an SSD as soon as you purchase this computer, then do not purchase it. With an SSD, you will love it. Other than that, the power of the computer is fine. If you plan to do intense video rendering or play video games on Ultra graphics with 60FPS, then this isn't for you. I haven't maxed out the 4GB of RAM with a variety of apps open, but I stay in the desktop app most of the time. I was a little wary of the 1.8GHz processor, but I haven't felt bogged down web browsing or playing oldschool games. You can go into BIOS and increase the video ram to 512MB as well. This will even play Skyrim on the lowest graphics settings. If you are going to use this for web browsing, Microsoft Office document editing, and other basic use, this is all the power you will ever need. Now I will discuss my experience with the SSD install, since I see lots of people having issues in other reviews. The factory hard drive is a SATA 3Gb/s drive. I had an Intel 320 80GB SSD (also SATA 3Gb/s) laying around, so I used it. I have read on some websites that it is a SATA 6Gb/s port, but I cannot comment, since I did not install one. I first attempted to use the Windows 7 File Recovery (Control Panel > File History > Windows 7 File History link in the bottom left) along with the Windows recovery disk. I created a system image on the SSD via USB port and then installed it. The computer would not boot past BIOS, regardless of what settings I changed or what keys I deleted. Then, I found Macrium Reflect (link in the first comment), reformatted the SSD and created a clone of all partitions on the factory hard drive except for the one labeled DATA (it was empty). Macrium Reflect automatically resized the system (C:) partition to fill the majority of the space on the SSD. Then, I installed the SSD again. This time, it booted up perfectly without changing any BIOS settings. Windows 8 automatically recognized it as an SSD and optimized it as such. Almost 30GB are used by the OS and associated files. I also removed the ASUS Smart Gesture program and installed the Elan touchpad drivers (link in the first comment). It still isn't perfect, I'd like to be able to reverse the direction of scrolling, but it's usable now. Good luck with your SSD install, and remember the Geek Squad will do it for $50 if you aren't mechanically inclined.
computer|I purchased this laptop at best busy for a discounted price of USD 450.00. I have been using this for about 20 days now. So far I have found the experience on this laptop to be great.PROS1. Very light and solidly built2. I like using the touchscreen and its touchpad. I see some people complaining about its touchpad but I found it flawless. But it is important to know the gestures used by windows 8 to have a great experience with the touchpad.3. Sufficient ports in such a thin device include a VGA portCONS1. Short battery life. Video-playback time is about 4 hrs.2. I would have preferred a 13' inch version of the laptop as it would have been a little more easier to type.I am giving it a 5 rating and not deducting for its cons because of is extremely low value. The cons are something that I can live with as I plan to use mostly at home and hence do not care so much about battery life and a 13' is desirable and not a necessity.
computer|I purchased the default options on this product, and I have to say, this is the finest, most trouble-free laptop I've ever owned. I was hesitant to move to a Windows 8 product because I feared the learning curve, but I should not have worried; no problem! In addition, my boyfriend, who is not even PC literate just caught on faster than I did, and loves it! His frustration level has completely diminished compared to his experience with his previous laptop (Windows XP).I have always preferred to build PCs with ASUS motherboards, so I thought this might be a quality unit, but I didn't anticipate the problem-free experience we have had. Windows 8's bugs do not affect a standard user experience on this unit, and likely they will be fixed before my boyfriend even becomes aware of them. I am quite pleased with the quality, both software, hardware, and price.You should definitely buy this one--
computer|The form factor is great, and Windows 8 is very fluid with a touchscreen device like this. However, by default the touchpad does not have smart gestures enabled. I had to go download the driver for that from the ASUS site, and it wasn't the most intuitive process. My other big complaint is that the 1/8&#34; jack functions as both headphone output and microphone input, so you have to jump to the desktop and select which you want every time you plug your headphones in. It's actually a pretty big annoyance, and I can't find a way to set headphones as default.All in all though, it's a great little casual computing machine.
computer|This laptop is quite good, mostly when taking price into account.Pros: Lightweight, touchscreen,thinCons: Inferior keyboard quality (I got a key that popped out in just one week), viewing angles of the screen are so limited, and short battery life.It would certainly do most tasks for anyone on the move, in need of a small laptop, and of productivity more than a tablet can offer.
computer|I bought this Asus X202e based on positive feedbacks from some users. To be honest, I was taking a chance of getting the 11.6" version instead of the 14" version as the latter at least comes with a MSata harddisk (24GB SSD + 500GB HDD) while the former only comes with 500GB HDD. I was actually thought of upgrading the HDD to SSD as soon as I laid my hands on it as my PC and all of my notebooks are using SSD. I bought the latest 256GB SSD Harddisk from Plextor (model: M5 Pro) and immediately put it into action after cloning it with the freeware, EaseUS ToDo Home edition. That's where all hell broke lose.First of all, never use the free cloning software that comes with the Plextor SSD Harddisk as it will somehow cause the notebook to boot into Bios perpectually. Even after cloning with EaseUS ToDo freeware, the notebook doesn't recognize the SSD HDD at all. I followed the tips in this thread to disable FastBoot and Secured Booting. It works but kept getting erratic performances like, internet explorer hanged, system freeze, reboot automatically, and many more. I was very disappointed because I noticed the Bios seems to have problem registering the new SSD HDD. Took me couple of days until I managed to downloaded the latest BIOS version 206. The version that came with my notebook was 202. I flashed my notebook with Bios ver 206 and viola ! Seems like all problems fixed. The notebook now can recognize my Plextor SSD HDD.Boot time slashed from about a min to 10 secs flat. Of course, not to mention, other applications open and close in a jiffy. The overall performance improves significantly. For those who doesn't like to flash bios, you can use Intel SSD HDD. When I was stuck (before flashing to ver 206 bios), I popped in my old 128GB Intel SSD HDD (I think its model is 320), it works without problem. I guess it is because the notebook is using Intel Chipset and thus, no compatibility issues.COnclusion: The stock version of the notebook is okay in terms of value for money but, the overall performance is below par perhaps, due to the stock 500GB HDD. If you have the mean and doesn't mind hands on, I suggest to change to a SSD HDD to see it fly.
computer|I love it!! I just wish it had windows 7.. The computer is light and is a lot like a mac book air.
computer|Over the years, I've mostly purchased last generation used laptops because I felt as if you get more bang for your buck. In particular, I've owned many Fujitsu laptops because they are usually very lightweight and often incorporate touchscreens.I saw this laptop on a daily deal for not a whole lot over $400 and decided that I'd give it a try. I'm very happy that I made the leap of faith.Frankly, I was worried about Windows 8. I had tested the beta on a non-touch enabled laptop and I wasn't terribly impressed. But on a solid touchscreen laptop like this Asus, it is transformed. Sure, I'm still learning my way around Win8 and sure I sometimes hit the wrong key or make the wrong gesture. But on balance, it's a very interesting and practical operating system and it seems to be pretty much made for this laptop.Everything is quite quick and zippy. It's very easy to use the new start screen and in one place, you have an easy touch-enabled interface with just about any application you'd like to use, and then some. This touchscreen simply blows away the touchscreens I've used in the past.I read some major computer site's review of this laptop and they gave it 2.5 stars. They must be insane. They also complained a lot about the display. The display is really nice. Very vivid. I've seen a few criticisms about poor viewing angles and I totally disagree with their views. Viewing angles are very good.The style of this Asus laptop is especially appealing. It has a streamlined, sleek and modern look to it. Much of the unit looks like or is aluminum. Using the keyboard is also confidence-inspiring. Everything just feels so very solid. And there are jacks for just about anything you might like to do. Oh, and the sound is absolutely terrific for a laptop this size.So what's not to like? Well, the 2 cell battery is undeniably small. I sense I'd get 4-5 hours of use out of it. That's fine for my needs, but it might not be fine for some. I hate the fact that the memory is soldered into place. I'd much rather do a cheap upgrade to 8 gb of RAM, but that simply isn't going to happen. Sure, the fan runs a lot, but it's not very loud and the computer really doesn't get very warm. I also don't like the fact that the hard drive was separated into 2 partitioned drives of roughly 250 gb each, although that was quickly resolved with free partitioning software. But you know, we can nitpick all that we want to, but this is an awesome touch-enabled laptop at a very low price.5+ stars all the way. Very highly recommended!
computer|Great price and Windows 8 is so much easier to use with a touch screen. Good battery life, really small transformer built into power cord. It does seem to take a long time to recharge.
computer|I bought this so I could just throw it in my backpack and take it with me. Anything larger would have been too big. However the 11.6" screen is not too small. It's very east to see and read text. Of course you can use a two finger gesture on either mouse pad or screen to enlarge the text. Reports of it running hot and noisy are just not true. I can watch Netflix for hours and it's barely warm to the touch. You can't hear the fan unless you stick your ear right up to it. Even then it's barely audible.I also bought this to replace my desktop. I have a Dell Inspiron 580 with i3 processor, 4GB ram and a 750 GB hard drive. This laptop has basically the same specs, just a smaller hard drive.I put this Vivobook on my desk and use a wireless mouse. I put in multi-monitor mode with extended desktop. I use an HDMI cable to attach my 24" monitor. I can watch Netflix on the 24" and still work productively on the laptop. It works great, nice smooth video, uninterrupted by anything I do on the laptop screen.The wifi works great. On my desk the speeds as tested by Speedtest.net were just as fast as when I used an Ethernet cable. It recognized all wireless networks up to at least 2 or 3 houses away from mine.the laptop speakers are nice, rich and clear, but not super loud. I have a pair of Harmon Kardon speakers hooked up through the headphone jack.Battery life is as advertised, 3.5 to 4 hours. Boot time from off is only about 30 seconds. If you run the sleep mode, you just close the lid to sleep, it turns on instantly when you open it.Windows 8 is easy to get used to, however there is a desktop mode very similar to Windows 7.The touch screen is very responsive and fun to use. Yes, even though the screen wobbles slightly when touched, it is a non issue. It doesn't affect the touch gestures at all.there are only a few things I could say negatively. 1. I would have preferred a matte screen. The glossy screen is a fingerprint magnet, so they give you a cleaning cloth with it. Also in certain situations there are reflections, but not when just looking head on indoors. 2. The keyboard lettering is not bright white like my Dell desktop keyboard. Which makes it a little hard to type in low light. However the keyboard is very responsive and easy to type with. It just takes a little getting used to if you're used to a full size desktop keyboard. I wish the battery was easily replaceable like most laptops and an extended battery was available. However I believe it can be replaced by removing the back cover. Also, the memory is not upgradeable, it's soldered in I hear.All being said, I like the Vivobook very much and the price was right at $499, just at my budget maximum.And it has worked flawlessly for the month I've had it. Would I buy It again? A resounding yes. Of course if I had $800-$1200 to spend I might have looked at other options. But this one is great.
computer|This is a great little notebook. The design is attractive and it functions flawlessly. The only drawback is that the keyboard is not backlit, but I knew that before purchasing it. The price was great and the build quality is on par with much more expensive machines. ASUS is now my first choice for any laptop needs.
computer|My old laptop broke and I picked up one of these about a month ago. Overall the computer is great, but I have two reservations: the hard drive and the clickpad. The most glaring issue is the clickpad, which you'll want to find new drivers for to stop it from having the cursor jerk around when you type. Luckily, it is a standard clickpad used in other laptops, and there are better drivers available. Second, the harddrive is a slow 5400 RPM, but you get what you pay for. I installed a 256 GB Samsung 830 SSD and the computer is now incredibly fast (at a total cost of around $700). The install was easy, if you're wondering, and the computer boots in under 10 seconds.I use it mostly for heavy web browsing (20+ windows), music, and light gaming. The guts are fast enough to do everything well, and I rarely tax the CPU/RAM (the 3rd gen processor is nice). I can even get Tropico 4 running at minimum settings at native resolution, and the computer handles itself well and doesn't overheat. The high point is the touch screen, which is very responsive and accurate (why didn't they just do the same for the clickpad, one wonders).Windows 8 is Windows 8, but it's helped by the touchscreen and some creative positioning of icons on the taskbar.A good buy overall, even better with a few modifications!
computer|I bought this Vivobook after reading the review. I was looking for a Touch enabled laptop with Windows 8 Pro so I can use it for school and work. This is an excellent choice for the price.It's a little heavier than I wanted, but for the price (compared to all the options) I think I have to sacrifice on weight.I loaded Office 2013 and it works very well.I was trying to find if a bios upgrade will be needed (like the review said) but my bios is at a rev that is not mentioned.I am debating on changing the HDD to SDD, but I don't know if that will void the warranty.I love my little Asus Vivobook after 3 days of playing around. Windows 8 is working fine too.
computer|I was heavily considering buying a MacBook Air rather than a small PC for awhile, but knowing it is at least double the price for the cheapest one, I didn't think the value was there especially since I am using it for everyday use. However, I love my new Asus laptop! I was researching for a new laptop since my old Asus was about 4 years old and it was time for an upgrade. I wanted something super portable that I can take with me anywhere. I found this little gem at Best Buy and bought it on Black Friday. I love Asus products and I knew I would be happy....and I am!The build is great. I love the aluminum finish and it just feels solid. The touch screen is very responsive, but I'm still using my regular mouse. Windows 8 does take some getting used to, but I'm sure I will over time. To me, the only huge difference is the Start Menu and everything else looks pretty much the same. I love how small and portable this is and the keyboard is pretty roomy for an 11.6 inch laptop. I also needed one with an HDMI port so I can hook it up to a monitor for movies and TV shows. The laptop is used a lot to catch up on my TV shows and occasionally watch movies. I have it hooked up to an Asus monitor (which I love as well!) via HDMI. My monitor doesn't have built-in speakers so I use the laptop's speakers instead. Wow! I didn't expect such a loud volume from this small device! For now, I'm putting off buying separate computer speakers. Battery life isn't that amazing, but I'm usually always next to an outlet. I love how small the A/C plug is, it really does look like a plug for a tablet which makes it easier to travel with. There isn't a CD/DVD drive, but I didn't really want one so I can keep the weight of my laptop light. I bought an external one for about $30 which I can take with me wherever. I also noticed that I didn't use my CD/DVD drive that much on my old laptop anyways.Only real downside I can say is that the fan is constantly on, but it's not that loud to me. It's kind of like white noise, but maybe I was used to my old laptop sounding like a blow dryer. Another (slight) downside is the keyboard is not back-lit. So I just keep my lamp on a little longer, not a big deal at all.This laptop is ideally for someone who travels, wants something very lightweight, and needs it for everyday use. It is definitely not for heavy gaming or anything that is graphic intense. If you're thinking about this laptop, definitely do your research and make sure this is the one for you.
computer|I am a computer junkie. Big time Apple fan boy. Writing this review wearing an Apple shirt.I own 3+ laptops at any given time. My workhorse is the Macbook Pro. Have an Alienware m14x for gaming. Why did I buy this laptop? For my girlfriend, of course. My girlfriend rarely uses a laptop. She lives on my ipad most of the days. But once in a while she wants to do some word processing and web browsing that need a little keyboard. I bought her the Samsung series 3 a year ago and she hated it. Everything is super slow. She is horrified by my big powerhouse laptops.I got this laptop for her and it is just perfect. The best part? The good touchscreen. It's sharp, responsive, you can pinch to zoom, just like the iPad. She does not care about the processor, ram, or anything besides a pretty screen and slick light weight laptop.I have to admit I enjoyed using it when she has it laying around. Remind me so much of my old macbook air, except with a nifty touch screen. I have to say I am very impressed by my first Asus purchase.
computer|If you have not yet downloaded this BIOS update (from 202 to 205, but I would check to make sure that your machine doesn't already have 205 somehow), try it out. It has increased my battery life slightly (around 15 minutes or so but I havn't done extensive testing here) and also seems to have toned down the overzealous cooling fans to quiet down the machine. I used this update on the q200 and it worked just fine. Shouldn't have any problems with the x202 or s200 versions if you use the winflash utility that comes with the laptop/you can download from the same site. (I will post it in the comments)beside that, I love this laptop and the more I use it, the more I end up just using the touchscreen. strangely, IE10 has been performing much better than expected and I have stopped using chrome now even. Basically, its got a highly responsive screen, OK battery life, and amazing build quality. Its all you can ask for really at this price point and its great to have a real hard drive, even if that means a few seconds longer on the boot time.
computer|Purchased the Asus Q200E-3KCT from Best Buy last week for $549.95 because Amazon was out of this model.It's the same basic computer as this except it has the Sandy Bridge i3-2365M 2nd Generation 1.4GHz processor.Wanted to evaluate the new Win 8 hybrid touch/laptop concept since I was intrigued with the idea since owing theOrig. Asus Transformer.I upgraded to a Samsung 256GB SSD immediately without ever trying the unit with the stock 5,400 HDD.So far the response seems pretty zippy, but I have not run any benchmarks yet. The SSD is rated at 8.1.I love the touch screen/keyboard useability. I hope Asus will produce their 1080P versions of this machine.I own the UXVD32 with i7 and 1080P and the visuals and computer performance are awesome. .I think it will be a matter of time before they will make this little machine with an i7 plus better graphics,and some SSD upgradeability. Better battery life would also be nice. This machine with SSD will last about 3.5 Hrs.with brightness turned up about half way. With graphics set on low levels it appears that it will run about 7 Hrs.just surfing the web or reading. I am still evaluating whether to keep it. I own both iPads and Android tablets.I think this hybrid approach will bridge both tablet and laptop worlds to some degree.I have not mastered using Microsoft Office documents on the iPad yet and think this machine might satisfy my mobile computing needs better than the iPad because I can handle Microsoft documents better with it. I need the full versions of Word and Excelplus portability and ease of use. This unit seems to do all of those things.
computer|To save time for other people who are also ASUS browsing, it took some time for me to figure out the difference between the X202 (sold by Amazon) and the S202 (available through common retail channels like Staples and Walmart.) The bottom line is, check the ASUS website they are essentially the same. (The X202 apparently comes with either the same or slightly different CPU than S202). It is sort of like the Toshiba branding of Z930 Z935, which are basically the same but intended for business vs personal channels.This is a budget price so not super fast but consider some advantages. You get a 500MB hard drive, not the 128SSD that is normal for even much more expensive ultrabooks. The chip is not super fast, but in Windows 8 when you open an app, you instantly get a splash screen for the app and then in 2 sec the program starts. Note that another Amazon reviewer said the touch pad is a little touchy but there was a newer driver. I was looking at faster more expensive laptops in the ultrabook range to serve as a new "travel" laptop for me, but asked myself, honestly, I'm 95% doing Word and Powerpoint and Email, will the chip speed matter much? Windows 8 is very very annoying at first (at least on a laptop as opposed to a tablet) but the touch screen is a little nifty, and one button puts you instantly into a Win7 like desktop although it boots into Win8. I thought about getting the ASUS here and putting an SSD into it, but many sources on the web says ASUS chassis are very tricky to put an SSD into, though it might be possible, it may not be 10 minutes, plug and play like some other brands and they talk about the weeds of the BIOS settings on ASUS and so on.
computer|I use it primarily for work. I don't like big heavy laptop, so I really love light weight of Asus Vivobook1) Touch screen is sensitive (compared to my previous laptop HP Touchsmart TM2). It would be great to have a pen input same as my Touchsmart2) Experienced lags when I opened more than 10 tabs in Google Chrome and several word/excel and pdf documents3) It would be great to have option to change battery for longer usage
computer|Build quality is great - the metal case is solid. Keyboard is great, keys have great tactile response. Touchscreen is great. Even the touchpad is great. Windows Experience score is 4.4 (limited by the graphics processing, the rest of the scores are in the 5s).Available at BestBuy for $499 Q200E). Which was also the price on Amazon yesterday, but today it's $599 so not purchased here.Windows 8 takes some getting used to though. They should include a primer with the various gestures.
computer|Love the size of it....easy to carry around. Love the touch screen as well. The only complaint, which I have read other reviews and they complained as well, is that the touch pad is ultra sensitive. Not sure what I am doing but if you drag the mouse in a certain direction, you loose the page you were on. You have to drag it(from the left) back on to your screen. this happens often and gets annoying. Other than that issue, it has been a great computer. I use it mostly to watch Netflix and surf the net
computer|I purchased this model a couple of weeks ago. I have purchased four Asus netbooks since 2007 and I still have all but the first one I bought (which was still running fine but had become obsolete in many ways, so I donated it). So as you can tell, I was a big fan of Asus netbooks. While the netbook era seems to have ended, I still wanted something that was a lot like a netbook: Highly portable, lightweight, sufficiently powerful to do most anything I need to do on a laptop, highly affordable, and durable enough to be taken on airplanes, to coffee shops, or wherever.This new Asus does the trick!Positives:First of all, at approximately $500, you are going to have difficulty finding this overall set of features and performance in a very small footprint laptop - period. Now if you want to spend $1000 or more, you will get a more upscale set of components elsewhere (including the Asus Zenbook offerings). The question is whether you need or will even notice the better performance. But assuming you like the notion of a modest, $500 investment, the Q200E is very worthy of consideration.The upsides of the Q200E: Very thin profile, weighs less than 3 lbs, nicely responsive 11.6 inch touch screen, runs Windows 8 and applications swiftly, starts up fast (like most of the "ultrabooks"), solidly built with an aluminum case, very good keyboard - especially for its size, attractive design (looks more expensive than it is), 3 USB ports (1 is 3.0), excellent sound from the speakers (surprisingly, the best I've heard - including from larger, more expensive laptops), a highly portable power adapter (no "brick") and a 500 GB hard drive that's more than sufficient.The downsides: The Intel i3 processor (1.8 GHz) is fast enough for anything I might do on this little computer, but folks who have very intensive computing needs will want a higher end, faster processor. Again, for my needs, I haven't experienced any limitations, but I'm not running computer aided design software or creating animation... Also, this unit comes with 4 GB RAM, which is not upgradeable. Would you need more? I don't, but if you think you will, you need a higher end laptop with more RAM or at least expansion capability. As for the screen, it is supposedly HD and I would describe it as "decent," it is simply not the kind of ultra HD screen you will get on a $1500 laptop. But then, if you want that level of resolution, you might also want a 13" screen or larger so you can really enjoy the advantages. I find that the 11.6" screen, while an upgrade for me personally from the 9 or 10 inch netbook screens, is still a bit smallish in terms of either serious movie watching or working for more than a few hours at a stretch. The battery life is unfortunately not in the realm of the little Asus netbooks with 6-cell batteries -- this unit has a 2-cell Lithium battery that is good only for 3 to 4 hours. It's also not easy to change it without unscrewing about 10 screws, so this unit will not provide those 6 or 7 hour marathons like the aforementioned netbooks. (If Asus were to come out with a replacement 4-cell battery for this unit, it would be a major upgrade! I'm going to keep my fingers crossed). Finally, I noted that some reviewers commented about the fan running frequently. I can tell you here and now that first of all, once I completed all of the Asus software updates, the fan seemed to run much less often. But regardless, the fan is very quiet. Unless you are working in a sound isolation chamber and are very distractable, believe me -- fan noise is not going to be an issue for you.The verdict: If you are comparing the Q200E to l1 or 13 inch laptops that cost $1000-$1500, you will find it lacking. No surprise! However, if you are not a "super user" and evaluate this unit in terms of its $500 price tag, you will be pleased. I give it 4.5 stars!----------------------------------------------REVISED REVIEW -- 2 WEEKS LATER----------------------------------------------Well, I am revisiting this review because about 2 weeks after my original review (and only a month into owning this Asus), the hard drive failed. Up to that point, this little computer worked great -- just as I described above. But one day, upon being shut down, the hard drive made some funny clicking noises. I thought it was strange but paid no heed until the next day, when I tried to power it back on. I could get only the system setup (Bios) screen, and nothing would work from there. Various tests returned messages about System Failure etc. I called Asus technical support, and spent 35 minutes wasting my time with the protocol, only for the tech to conclude what I knew: the hard drive had failed. He directed me back to BestBuy. The technical guy at BestBuy examined the computer to make sure I hadn't tampered with it and he booted it up and checked it out. Same conclusion. Because it was so new, they actually offered me to exchange for a new one, or issue a refund. My confidence in Asus a bit shaken, I took the refund.As a result of my experience, I'm knocking off a star. But I'm not giving an even lower rating because every brand does experience a failure rate. The BestBuy tech told me that it was the first Asus of this type to come back; he noted another brand that he saw returned frequently for failed hard drives (I won't repeat the brand here, since this is basically hearsay). He noted that his experience so far had been that this model Asus (and Asus in general) are quite reliable, but as he pointed out, if they make 100,000 of them and there's a 1% failure rate, that's still a 1000 defective units....So it might still be worth a try, despite my experience. This Asus seemed very solidly built and has a great form factor. It's too bad this happened but you might have better luck. (I decided to go with a higher end Sony Vaio S series 13.3", which was twice the price, but ultimately had some other features I wanted and stronger performance...so far so good with the Sony Vaio).
computer|I will never go back to a non-touch laptop. This machine is awesome and the price makes it all the better. The whole experience with Asus was just like it should be with a new computer. They're doing some awesome work in the PC space. From the moment of unboxing to the set up, it was a breeze. I had this machine going in no time. The touch performance is excellent. Looking at the machine, I would expect it to cost much more. I would highly recommend this machine to anyone who wants to get a touch laptop even those who may be looking for a high-end machine. This device fits the bill for many needs and budgets.
computer|I bought this to replace my UX31E (bought in February 2012). That one was just fine until the screen began to bother me due to lack of contrast and the poor viewing angles. The X202E has a better screen, and a much better keyboard. It is thicker, and has a smaller screen with poorer resolution, but for a $500 laptop with touchscreen it is fine. I use it mainly for typing documents and reading on the internet. However, it even runs Civ5 with touchscreen. Not too bad.My only problem (really) is the SLOOW charging. 1.75A charger. What the...? Even ipads have 2.1A chargers.On the plus side, the battery life is good, averaging at 5 hours for light use.One thing, though. I replaced the HDD with my Intel 310 (80gig) SSD. Much better now, although once booted, the HDD was just fine for my needs, too.Edit 2012/12/17In order to get better battery life, I looked up how to enable Device Initiated Power Management on the SSD, found this. It worked. I get better longevity when typing. It does not do much while surfing the internet, though, since the SSD is constantly in use, and has little time to power down. Here goes:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Power\PowerSettings\0012ee47-9041-4b5d-9b77-535fba8b1442\0b2d69d7-a2a1-449c-9680-f91c70521c60\Attributes = 2This registry entry enables the option below in Advanced Power SettingsControl Panel - Power Options - Change Plan Settings (the one in use) - Advanced Power Settings - Hard Disk - HIPM+DIPM (on both battery and plugged in)
computer|This review is to dispel any incorrect info in the "User Reviews".I'll quickly explain that I am a technician and have been modifying all the non touch Win 8 machines, to look and run like 7. It's a 2 minute job that requires a small program like Classic Shell or iobit's Start 8.As I give tech advice on some forums, I felt the need to get some experience on Win 8's touch interface, Otherwise, how could I help others, if I've never even used it.So let's get down to business and set the record straight of what it is, and what it isn't.WIFIThose folks who have wifi connectivity problems, have a defect. If they reinstall the OS from the partition that is provided for that purpose, and then it still has wifi problems, then it's time to return the machine or get it fixed, or even get another wifi card. Anyone who thinks that it's inherent to this machine and has decided to put up with it, is mistaken and being inconvenienced unnecessarily.TOUCHPADThose who find that the touchpad is wonky, are either palming it while typing, or have a defect. The same applies as above. Try installing the OS again and if it is still acting up and you're 100% sure that you're not palming the touchpad, then it is defective and needs to be returned or repaired. This is NOT a normal condition.BUILD & SCREENThis laptop is well built with premium quality materials. Anyone who feels their screen is weak, should return it. It is NOT a normal condition for this machine, and for those who complained about the bezel being too wide, it is built that way to be structurally strong enough. A touchscreen receives light impact from being touched, thus it needs to be built a bit more solidly than a normal screen.Complaints about the screen being shiny are valid in a sense. It is truly shiny, but it's a necessary evil. Matte surfaces get dirty faster and are harder to clean.KEYBOARDThe keyboard is neither exceptionally good or bad. Everyone has a different concept of what a keyboard should be, so there's no right or wrong. It's just an individual's preference. If the keyboard doesn't work perfectly, the machine should be returned or repaired.BATTERY LIFEWe've heard a wide range of claims, from 2 to 7 hours. Obviously, someone is wrong. Most of the User Reviews, have it straight, when they claim approx. 4 hours. Even if you dimmed the screen and avoided multitasking, you'd still be hard pressed to get 5 hours out of it, and it's unrealistic to expect that, as the screen would be hard to see, at that low brightness. Those who have claimed 3 hours or less, may be running power consuming programs, like watching video/movies at full brightness, in which case, it is 100% true that it will only get 3 hours or less, under those conditions.(See Suggestions below for some revised info)CAMERAYes, it is true, that it's horrible. If you are not in a brightly lit area, the image will be grainy. It is certainly way below the quality of the average laptop webcam.(see SUGGESTIONS below for a revised evaluation)POWER & SPEEDThose who find that this notebook is slow, or it hesitates/stutters or freezes up, have a defect. Redo the system as mentioned above and if it persists, it is a defective machine. Even with all the bloatware running, this Vivobook has ample power, to handle all the normal use, without ever hesitating or freezing up.(See SUGGESTIONS below for additional info on power plans for better performance)SSDYes it is true that it will be substantially faster and more responsive, if you swap out the hard drive for an SSD. Any and all laptops will benefit, but it is not necessary to swap the hard drive out, as it performs just fine as it is. It's a luxury to go with an SSD. I have swapped the HD out for an SSD in this machine, because I wanted to know how much of a difference it would make, and not because it ran poorly with the included 500 gig hard drive.While on this subject, those who feel that it is difficult to remove the backplate to access the hard drive, are mistaken. Yes, it is firmly in place and it requires the right tool to pry it apart, but that is entirely normal for almost all laptops. Swapping out the hard drive on this unit, is a breeze.FINGERPRINTSI got lucky and received the Silver model (looks like champagne to me) as the silver lid does not show fingerprints as much as the black version. Again, this is normal. Black brushed aluminum laptops, are fingerprint magnets and they need to be cleaned everyday.VALUEThe sum total of this Vivobook's exceptional build with premium materials, slim and light, great performance, decent battery life, all the necessary ports, good wifi reception and a very decent touchscreen, make it a real bargain at $500 or less.COMMENTS, CONS & COMPLAINTSThe webcam is very poor.It would be wonderful to have a backlit keyboard, even though it would shorten the laptop's battery life.This unit is slow to charge. From bone empty, it may take as long as 4 hours to get to 100%. This may inconvenience some folks (not me), but on the positive side, the internal battery may last several more years than if it were fast charged.A few users have suggested changing graphics setting to -20 brightness, 51 contrast and 0.9 gamma, and I agree that it looks better that way.I ran a timer since turning the laptop on at 100% charged and it is now up to 2 hours and 7 minutes, having used 44% of its battery life, so that would come out to a potential 4 hours and 48 minutes, however the machine will shut down before reaching 0%, and it should be noted that I was only running this webpage and the timer, nothing else, so it would be unrealistic to expect that much battery life under normal circumstances.The Win 8 touch interface is vastly superior to iOS (iPad), Android, webOS or any after market ones. It is true that the store does not have very many apps, but that will come with time. You'd be hard pressed to find any high quality free games, so don't get your hopes up, YET!_________________________________________________edit.SUGGESTIONS1) Download an app called "Show Me", which will give you detailed visual explanations of everything you can do in Win 8's touch interface. Even if you think you know it all, I bet you'll learn a few new things.2) Clean the screen around the webcam area and you may discover (as I just did) that the camera is a lot better than it was, presumably a bit dirty from top of the screen swipes.3) If your machine hesitates, stutters or freezes while on battery but performs well when plugged in, you may have to change your power plan to "High Performance". The Power4Gear system, halves the CPU, ram graphics and Wifi power. If you do go to High Performance while on battery, you may want to turn down the brightness a bit, so as to improve battery life.4) If you use the Powe4Gear power plan while on battery, it is possible to reach 5 hours of usage, provided you are not running many processes in the background, and are not playing games or viewing video.5) After updating your Vivobook with Asus' Live update program, uninstall it, to stop it running in the background (it can't be stopped otherwise). If you need it again in the future, you can download the installer from the Asus website.6) If you run Windows Defender, there is no need for any additional Anti Virus programs, as Defender in Win 8, is a full Anti Virus program that is reputed to do as good a job as any other free AV program. If you are running another AV program, either uninstall it and use Defender, or keep it and turn Defender off in "Services". Running both at the same time will seriously slow down your computer.
computer|Es un ultrabook excelente, la relacion costo beneficio es muy buena, recomiendo siempre usar la pantalla con un lapiz tactil a veces el dedo es poco preciso. muy rapido, sin ruido, muy liviano.
computer|Great, useful laptop for 1/3 the price of a certified &#34;ultrabook&#34;, and every bit as capable unless you are into games and video production.
computer|For roughly 550.00 this can hardly be beat for a small laptop that has windows 8 and a touchscreen. At first I was a little aggravated with the touch pad but, I installed the drivers from Samsung's website that are supposed to be for a series 5 laptop. This laptop along with several others have the same Elan touch pad in them. Once you install this driver it is a night and day difference in the touchpad.The link for the drivers is in the first comment. Amazon won't let you link to an external website in the main review.So go to the comment and get to the link then follow what is below.You then need to click on the Manuals and Downloads link, then click Driver.After that scroll down and click on the ZIP link for the Touch Pad driver 11.7.2.1If you have the sorry Asus Smart Gesture installed, uninstall that first and reboot, then install this software. I have had various Macbooks for the better part of the last 7 years and this is my first PC laptop in a while. I was almost ready to return this laptop until I found these drivers. I would say the touch pad is 95% of a Macbook touch pad now and whether you like Apple or not, you have to admit they know what they are doing when it comes to track pads. Aside from all of that I'm extremely happy with the operation of this laptop now.I am coming from a laptop that had an SSD drive in it so it does seem a little slow in some areas but, others it is working just fine. I have an extra SSD drive that I plan on putting in this machine as well as removing the half height mini PCI atheros wireless/bluetooth combo. I purchased an Intel Centrino 6235anhmw Mini Pci Express Bluetooth 4.0 to replace it with and based on my research I should be able to enable Intel Wireless Display on this laptop after that install. The card only cost me 30.00 bucks and I figured it was worth the gamble to see if it would work. I'll update this review once I get the card in a couple of days to state if it worked or not.The sound coming from this laptop is actually quite good and I would say better than a lot of the previous laptops I am use to.The touchscreen is extremely responsive and I haven't had any missed touches or erratic behavior out of it. I have played several touch based games and it worked flawlessly.Last but, not least this thing is solid, the build quality on it is exceptional for something this cheap.Okay, now for the bad which again considering this is a cheap laptop with a touchscreen really isn't that bad.The fan runs constantly and while it is not overly annoying it does seem to run even when not doing much on the system. That is really my main complaint about the machine at this point. The second complaint is that the viewing angles on this machine are pretty poor but, again don't expect any machine at this price point with a touchscreen to have great viewing angles. Although viewing angles are bad, brightness is very good. I think with the brightness turned all the way up you could possibly do permanent damage to your eyes(a joke of course).The keyboard is a little cramped but, really not all that bad. I would say I have slightly above average hand size but, again it isn't to bad and I'm able to kick out a reasonable speed without to many more mistakes than I usually make. Expect some adjustment if you are coming from a full size keyboard with large hands.Again, the stock hard drive is a 5400rpm drive and it does seem a little slow for me but, if you are coming from another mechanical drive then you may not really notice it as a problem. I've been using SSD drives for some time so it does bother me a bit.These might be major problems for others but, for me they are minor annoyances that I can live with on a cheap machine like this. This is basically an 11.6" Macbook Air that is missing the SSD(entry level is 64GB SSD), backlit keyboard, viewing angles aren't as good for the ASUS and fan runs more often than Macbook Air. However the Macbook Air doesn't have these features: touch screen, 500GB HDD that can be upgraded to a small or large SSD if you like and the Air cost about 450.00 more for the entry level. Granted the Macbook Air is considerably lighter but, it also makes your wallet lighter.Sorry for all of the Macbook comparisons but, I have come from many years of having Macbooks and decided with Windows 8 to give PCs a try again. I'm glad I did.Update 11/8/2012:I installed the Intel wireless card I mentioned above, then installed the latest drivers for the card from the Intel website as well as the latest video drivers from the ASUS website. Then I installed the Widi display software and was able to connect to my Belkin Screencast. It took several tries and then it finally updated the software on the Belkin. After that it has been connecting perfectly with no problems. So I paid 40 bucks on Amazon for a refurbished Belkin Screencast and 32.00 for the intel card. Now for 72.00 bucks I'm able to use my 55" HDTV at 1080p as a second screen.Update 11/14/2012I finally got around to installing an SSD drive and replacing the mechanical drive. The drive that came in it was a Hitachi HTS5450A7E380 which is a 7mm thick drive. Unfortunately the SSD I had was a typical 9.5mm and was too thick to work at first. Luckily I was able to remove part of the casing on the SSD drive I used and that made for a perfect fit. So if you plan on swapping out for an SSD make sure it is no thicker than 7mm or it won't fit. I had some trouble where the laptop kept booting into the BIOS. when I went in and disabled fast boot as well as turned of drive security or something like that. I can't remember exactly now but, when the option is enabled you can go further into the BIOS and see PKI keys and DDB keys and a lot of other keys. I just disabled that portion and then it started recognizing the hard drive. This may not be a problem if you clone the hard drive to the SSD before you swap but, I did a fresh install. Laptop is blazing fast now as it boots into windows in about 10 seconds.
computer|I'm an IT professional, and have dealt with a few ASUS laptops, which I now prefer to Dell.If you take remove the 9 phillips screws on the bottom, you have access to some of the internal components.You will need to tug a little, as the case is still held in place by little plastic clippies all around.You might break a nail, so be careful.MEMORY:The memory is soldered into the board, so 4GB is all you will ever have. Period.DISK DRIVE:The HDD is a Hitachi HTS5450A7E380 (7mm 2.5") and can be replaced with another "Low Profile" 7mm SSD or HDD. You simply remove 3 screws that hold the cage in (the 4th screw is already removed from removing the back panel), remove the cage, remove 4 screws holding drive in cage, replace with a SATA II/III drive. (It is a SATA 3 6.0 GB/s connection).I recommend the Samsung 840 series, as they are 7mm 2.5" and very low on power usage. When you remove the old HDD, it has a plastic backing glued on it with two rubber foam strips.Don't worry with removing it from the old HDD. An SSD doesn't need the shock absorption and will be mounted securely with the screws.WIRELESS:The Atheros AR5B225 Half Mini PCIe WiFi/Bluetooth 4.0 module is replaceable.I am replacing mine with Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6235 so I can use WiDi and Dual Band Wifi.It was as easy as removing the two antenna wires from the Atheros, popping in new card, reattaching two antenna wires to the Intel 6235.BATTERY:The 5136 mAh 2 cell battery is replaceable, albeit proprietary. Not sure what this means for the future.MY GENERAL OPINION OF THE LAPTOP and Windows 8:I have been using Windows 8 at work for a bit, and as an OS, it's hard and confusing with a dual monitor desktop power user setup (as I have no need for the Metro interface there, and I feel like I'm fighting it). I had to tweak it to get my start menu back (Open source utility called "Classic Start"). However, with a touch screen laptop, it is very easy to use. I've been thoroughly been enjoying it as a tablet replacement. I admit, I did install an SSD in it, and it is SO much more responsive now (and shaved some ounces on weight as well has dropping at least a watt of power draw). I also have access to a Windows 8 volume license key, and mine is running Windows 8 Enterprise.
computer|I bought mine from the Microsoft store a couple days ago. This review does not cover my experience with Windows 8.I've been looking for a new machine to carry on trips and to do presentations with to customers. So, it has to have the ability to do emails, browsing, pdf display, have a vga out connector, and a usb connector for the remote.I've used larger laptops on trips, and smaller ones. This one seems about just the right size and weight. I've always hated the touchpads on them, and would use a plugin external mouse. To my pleasure, the touchscreen interface eliminates most of the problems with the touchpad.The machine does all that I require, and exceeds my expectations with a giant disk drive. I'm surprised by how much I like it. It feels solid and well made. It boots and shuts down faster than any other machine I've had.On the downside, I would like to have the retina display, and the machine isn't silent - there's the fan and the rotating disk drive which makes a little noise when you tilt the machine. I'd rather have an SSD, but I did not take any stars off for these issues because they would have added considerably to the price.
computer|I haven't bought a PC laptop in years. I build my own desktops, but when it comes to laptops I stuck with Apple. But lately I began to realize that while the MacBook Pro was a good computer it delivered more horsepower than I actually needed. So I decided to sell it and find a Windows replacement. I needed a basic system that I could take with me on the job and transfer video from an SCHC card to a hard drive. I didn't need a powerhouse laptop. After a bit of searching I settled on the X202E.The main reasons was it was a system taking advantage of the latest technology Windows 8 touted: touch screen. The price was also very reasonable. I got mine used, though Like New, for $470 through a seller here on Amazon. Add a case and an anti-glare screen protector for a grand total of $500. Not a bad price at all for what you get.The touch screen is vibrant and responsive. While not an exceptionally fast system it gets the job done well enough. This is definitely what Windows 8 set to revolutionize and it does it well. I was never a hater of the Metro UI, but didn't see the point on a desktop system with a 20+ inch screen. For a laptop however... it's very nice. I can only imagine how a tablet would be or a Windows 8 phone.The system is minimal input ports: 3 USB, and HDMI, an ethernet port and a VGA port. Why this thing comes with a VGA port is beyond me. For as advanced as the laptop is this port is a pimple on an otherwise beautiful face. If you need an optical drive you're out of luck. This slender thing doesn't have one, so you'll need an external drive if you want/need one.Speaking design it is fairly lightweight and has a nice modern design to it. I actually think it has a nicer design than the MacBook Air, though not quite as thin.I have only two minor issues: the touchpad is extremely sensitive. Even with the updated drivers from Samsung another reviewer recommended, the touchpad will easily misinterpret what you want to do. I'm getting better at it, but it will take a little time to get used to it. Also, you have to press the touchpad buttons a bit harder than you should have to. My other issue is the keyboard isn't backlit. Not a deal breaker, and I realize Asus needed to make sacrifices to keep the price down, but how much would a couple of LED's actually cost? As I said, it would have been nice but not a big deal.One thing to note: I haven't bought a Windows computer in years, but I remember you generally got an activation code with the system, either as a sticker on the computer somewhere or a postcard in the package. Neither were present in this purchase. I contacted the seller and he doesn't remember seeing one either. I'm not sure if this goes for all units or just mind, but this problematic in the event you need to re-install the OS and need the activate it. I managed to get my code using a small program that tracked it down in the registry for me, but you shouldn't have to do this. I'd be curious to hear if others who bought the system new experience the missing activation code. It could also be the way Windows 8 is handled on new systems. I don't know.All-in-all, this is a terrific system, especially for the price. If you want a sleek, modern Windows system you can't go wrong with this one. The 11" screen doesn't feel small in the least, and I'm very happy with my purchase.UPDATE (11/22/2012): I received word from the seller, as well as independently confirmed with ASUS, that this system does not come with a Certificate of Authenticity. From their support site: "For Windows 8, activation is done with a new process. There is no need for Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker or entering product key."
computer|Firstly, some reviewers have referred to this laptop as a netbook. I have nothing against netbooks, but this is actually an ultraportable notebook. In fact, if it had even a hybrid SSD it would meet ultrabook specs. It certainly has the build quality of an ultrabook.The good:- As I said, excellent build quality including the very responsive touchscreen. People have been guessing that I must have paid at least $800 for this machine based on its look and feel alone. It looks and feels like something between a Macbook Air and Pro.- Remarkably thin considering that it has built in VGA and ethernet ports, and yes, some people still need those!- It's fast. Obviously with a Core i3 and 4GB of RAM it's not the most powerful device on the market, but if you're not a gamer or into heavy multimedia editing it runs like a breeze. It boots up faster than ANY computer I have ever seen not equipped with an SSD. I guess Windows 8 is to thank for that.- Speaking of Windows 8, this is a review of the machine not the OS, but I'll just say that it's basically Windows 7 with a better start menu and some handy touched based functionality. On a touchscreen device like this one, I don't see any reason to complain about it.- Incredibly compact power cable. No brick. It's like a tablet charger. You can literally coil it up and carry it in your pocket.The Bad:- Battery life is indeed about 4-5 hours... that is, with careful power management and light use. Not stellar, but I guess it does deliver the "up to 5 hours" promised.- A little heavy for its size, certainly not so much to be tiring to carry.- Some reviewers have complained about the trackpad. I haven't updated any drivers and I don't find it to be terrible by any means, but it can be a hair too sensitive at times, sometimes registering a single tap as a double.Overall:I'd actually give it a 4.5 if I could. I've looked into a lot of alternatives, and I don't believe there is currently a better laptop for under $600 on the market right now. Certainly not in the 11.6" form factor, where the alternatives are either netbooks of inferior build quality and specs, or an ultrabook/Macbook Air for hundreds of dollars more.
computer|I purchased this laptop at microcenter on the thanksgiving day. To my surprise, they didn't run out of stock on this.I used enough laptops to know a good one when I see it. I own a HP dm1z-2000 laptop, it served me well with windows 7. I installed windows 8 on it several days ago, and the experience has been a mixed bag.Windows 8 is smooth, pretty, fast. But sometime it doesn't make sense on my dm1z. Windows 8 is an attempt by microsoft to marry the touch UI with classic UI. It largely worked. no matter which UI you are using, it works. What doesn't work, is when you transition from one UI to the other. This awkwardness threw people off constantly.Then I got ASUS X202E. It simply works. The awkward transition between two UIs on a non-touch screen laptop mostly disappeared. The touch screen gestures serve the purpose exceedingly well.Windows 8 is meant to be touched, if you gonna buy a non-touch device, get a Windows 7 for cheap, without a touch screen, Windows 8 is somewhat broken.X202E has other pros as well. It's running pretty cool, decent battery life, 3-4 hours. maybe 5 if you use it conservatively. It has a reasonably good processor with an Intel HD 4000 graphic card. It's by no means powerful, but sufficient to run some games ( I heard Diablo 3 works fine on it).It has one USB 3 port, 2 USB 2 ports, HDMI, SDHC. It also has a small power adapter (as small as power adapters for some android tablets) that is so much easier to carry, you can practically put it in your pocket.At this price of ~$500, this cannot be beaten.
computer|This is a breakdown of what three models being sold in the States.Q200E-BHI3T45: 2nd-gen i3, Intel HD 3000, single antenna (black wire only), no bluetooth, BestBuy exclusiveS200E-RHI3T73: 3rd-gen i3, Intel HD 4000, single antenna (black wire only), no bluetooth, comes with external DVD, Staples exclusive(?)X202E-DH31T : 3rd-gen i3, Intel HD 4000, dual antenna (black & white wires), bluetooth, various retailersI bought the S200E as there's NO information about it and searching the web you find they're sold in Asia primarily. Was surprised to see it being sold here as I thought it would be a direct copy of the X202 but I found out that is not the case. I'll be returning the S200 to get the X202 as I intend to upgrade to SSD and Intel 6235 WiFi w/WiDi. If you want dualband WiFi like me, the X202 model is the best way to go.*However, no one has confirmed about being able to access 5GHz band from upgrading their WiFi card yet. Hopefully someone who has done it will chime in, if not, whenever I finally get it done I'll update this review.EDIT: 5GHz band accessible after upgrade!
computer|Where do I start?First of all, at this price is impossible to beat this machine (at least in this moment). It is one of the cheapest (if is not the cheapest one out there) wich has the same quality than any other 11.6" ultrabook... and by "quality" I mean the overall performance, materials and aesthetics. Actually if you compare it with any other ultrabook side by side, you won't see any real difference or disadvantage. Yes, there is other little ultrabooks (not notebooks) wich may look "better", but probably at twice it's price.The experience with this notebook is just amazing. I've only used it for one week, but it's enough to recognize the potencial that it has. I'll clarify that I changed the HDD for a SSD (Samsung 840 120gb, wich is one of the fastest SSDs out there right now)... this is probably one of the major changes that you would have to consider once you get this machine. There is nothing bad with the normal HDD, and actually it performed really well when I tested it the first day, but SSDs nowadays is another world (boots in less than 8 sec., maybe less if you don't set any password hehe)I did a little bit of everything so far, from multitasking, HD movies, and light gaming. You can play without problems some light game engines, like Source... at the cost of lower details of course. And I can say that everything worked much better than I expected.Now you may think: why should I take a notebook with touch screen capabilities?... Well, at first I thought about this, and only 2 things changed my mind. One that it has Windows 8, and Metro is designed for touch (no problem with mouse, but you will experencie a better feeling using the touch screen) And the second one the price... the cheapest one out there wich also has touch (I said "why not then...") And I'll say that I'm not a real lover of touch screen devices, but I'm totally happy that I picked this one... One example of good utility: I was in my bed laid down watching a movie with the notebook over my belly and I couldn't reach or see the keyboard properly... no problem! now I have a touch screen keyboard, cool.For everyone out there wich has problems using Windows 8 because you don't understand how to use it... simple, go to youtube and look for some tutorials about Metro interface and new desktop.SummarizingPROS:- Price!!!- Build quality- Performance- Design, I love it.- Light, even with charger and a wireless mouse in the bag .- Lots of ports for this size (2 usb 2.0, 1 usb 3.0, sd card, rj45, normal hdmi, audio/mic jack in one port, even VGA! incredible)- Big touch pad (and with proper updates it works just fine)- Nice keyboard layout and size- Battery life may or may not be a good thing for everyone in this notebook, but if you upgrade bios and tweak the power saving settings you will get a good amount of battery (3 to 4hs at high performance tasking, or 5 to 6hs at light performance tasking).- Touch screen!- Decent TN panel wich has nice color contrast and brightness (and also viewing angles are not that bad)- Sound quality is very nice! I was impressed the first time I listened to a song.- Some people have changed the wifi adaptor for better range or stability. I didn't, and so far it worked well!- Probably some other thing that I'm skipping right now heheNow, you will say... why this guy put 4 stars instead of 5 if it is that good and he is so happy? hahaWell, nothing in this world is perfect and I'm a picky person (even more with technology) BUT listen, nothing of this cons are major drawbacks, and actually are minor details wich some can be solved by simple ways.CONS:- Glare screen. Yes, it is glare and it may be difficult to read with excesive light. Easily solved by some anti-glare protective lcd screen.- It takes finger prints easily.- It takes some time to be fully charged (battery).- No illuminated keyboard. At this price we can't argue about this, I know it... but I always want more hahaha.- No replaceable battery.- No memory upgrade capabilities.Well, that's it!And the last thing... some technical comments to be ready:As I said, I changed the HDD for a SSD. No problems with this, just deactivate boot protection in bios. I used Acronis True Image 2013 (burned into a cd, and I used an external dvd that I have) to clone HDD into SSD, be careful here because not every software works with my SSD or this bios. With Acronis 2013 I had no problems!This comment and any other aspect of the technical part are commented in other reviews.Go!!! What are you waiting for? Go and I pick one! hahahaGreetings and happy 2013
computer|The form factor, specs, and cost all made the Vivobook a product that I was excited to have and to recommend to whoever I came across. Of course, the highlight was the touchscreen which is VITAL if you're using Windows 8. Adding to that was the excellent workmanship (metallic palmrest) and the perfect size and weight (liked it better than the Zenbook or MacBook Air).But less than 2 months later, it all turned into a nightmare.I can give the conclusion from the very beginning: Swap out the 500GB HDD for a 256GB SSD as soon as you take it out the box. I'm convinced that Asus put in a cheap part (HDD) in order to keep the cost low. But you will pay dearly for that error.1. During normal usage, the dreaded "Click of Death" came, which is when the head/arm in the HDD touches the platter (disk). I tried to shut it down as soon as possible. But the next time it turned on, the OS wouldn't load and only the BIOS screen would appear. The machine was effectively dead.2. Asus's warranty would replace the HDD but wouldn't recover the data, all while taking 2 weeks to return the machine to you. And just opening the machine to swap the HDD yourself would void that warranty.3. Upon opening the HDD, I found that the head was defective (after just 2 months) and tried everything to recover the data. The pros would charge approx $2,400 (no exageration) to repair this kind of HDD problem. After 3 days, this became a lost cause and I knew I'd have to start from scratch.4. I installed a 256GB SSD.5. Asus wouldn't give me an ISO image of the factory Vivobook. They told me I also had to get the OS from Microsoft directly, who in turn said they couldn't get me a full version Windows 8, but only an upgrade from Windows 7. This meant I had to install Windows 7 first, then upgrade to Windows 8.Now I'm stuck because the BIOS won't let me set the boot order to the USB drive. And, yes, I've flashed it to version 206. IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THIS, PLEASE COMMENT.In spite of all the headache, my only advice is to swap for a SSD immediately. 95% of my docs were backed-up but I didn't make an ISO image of the whole system, so I'm paying for it.In the end, I still think this is a good machine which just had 1 cheap part which went bad very quickly. (BTW, the floor model at the store also had the same problem.)
computer|The Vivobook is a triumphant result of the minimalist doctrine that currently permeates the computer industry, because it retains excellent function in its diminutive form. The touchscreen, which is necessary for an enjoyable Windows 8 experience, is satisfyingly responsive.DESIGN:Nothing about the Vivobook's design suggests that it costs $500. The 11.6-inch laptop is a mere 0.8 inches thick, and weighs 2.9 pounds. The brushed-metal body is sleek and sturdy. The rubberized bottom prevents the laptop from sliding on surfaces during touchscreen use. Similarly, the hinge offers enough resistance to allow for touchscreen use, without being too stiff to open or close.PERFORMANCE:This laptop is excellent for surfing the web, streaming videos, and word processing. It boots to the login screen in about 12 seconds, which is a substantial improvement over past Windows laptops.FINAL WORD:The Asus Vivobook X202E is ideal for college students, because of its size, weight, durable yet stylish design, touchscreen, and price. It is the best laptop in the world for $500.For a more detailed review, check the comments below.
computer|Update 18-Mar-2013: Wanted to specifically mention that battery endurance is impressive for my usage. I can get up to four hours of web surfing if I needed it. I find that I'm more productive with this computer because the processor and SSD (user upgrade) are quite fast. My morning web surfing episodes are noticeably shorter.Update 15-Mar-2013: I improved the touchpad by installing ASUS touchpad driver from their website and customizing features. The current driver is named SmartGesture_ASUS_Win7_8_VER1036.zip. Once installed, double click the ASUS SmartGesture icon in the taskbar (usually bottom-right on desktop). My preference, YMMV, was to uncheck all features except Select and Activate. I still don't like the touchpad but now it's more predictable. I also changed Control Panel->Mouse->Pointer Options->select-a-pointer-speed a couple notches faster.The ASUS X202e (ASUS S200e) is an excellent value despite its flaws. Here's some tweaks to share. Some require hacker-level experience. I use the X202e mainly for web surfing. Your tweaks may vary with use case.1. Replace the hard drive with an SSD for much faster speed. The processor is quite fast for web surfing but you'll really appreciate the added speed of an SSD. I only need a 60GB+ SSD for my usage. Be sure the SSD is a 7mm height drive such as a Samsung 840.2. I hate bloatware. I reinstalled Windows 8 from a generic 64-bit Windows 8 DVD. No activation key was needed. The only driver I needed beyond what Windows 8 installed was the audio drivers for the microphone. I downloaded from ASUS support web page. I installed using a generic USB DVD drive.3. The default screen settings make the display a bit washed out looking. To fix, right click on the desktop->Graphics Properties->Display->Color Enhancements. Change Brightness to -20, Contrast to 51 and Gamma to 0.9.4. I use Ninite.com to quickly install many often used programs.5. I swear the touchpad has been improved by an initial cleaning. I used window cleaner.6. I haven't found a better touchpad driver than the stock Windows 8 driver. I'm open to alternate drivers. Please make recommendations in comments but please, document any non-standard settings.7. I reset the BIOS to defaults and then chose "Optimal Settings". Don't assume the manufacturer installed with optimal settings selected.8. I love Windows 8 but only when with the Windows 7 shell, so I installed EX7FORW8 software. Recommended. Touch continues to work.With these tweaks, you'll get a much better X202E experience. I'm hoping a new driver will improve the too touchy touchpad. Yes, the screen could be a bit better but it's acceptable. Battery life is ample with my usage. I get about 4 hours web surfing -- more than expected and more than needed for my usage.
computer|After having an ongoing bad customer experience with Dell, I went on the search for a small second laptop to use for school only. This laptop fit that need perfectly. It is just the right size, easy to type on, and extremely light. I also love that the ASUS has the touchscreen and the computer, itself, is built really solid. Honestly it is built much better than the main laptop that I use. After having it for a week and downloading several software programs, it still runs super fast.I have heard several people complaining about Windows 8 but I have to admit, while it is very different, if anyone has owned a tablet or a smart phone, the transition to Windows 8 will be seamless - because of the touchscreen. I couldn't image trying to navigate the system without having that key element.The only downside of my order was not the ASUS computer but was the case I ordered. Amazon advertises the laptop and then a Case Logic case as that "order both" combination - the case does not fit the laptop at all. It was only $11 and some change so I'm sure I can find a use for it. Isn't worth it to return it but maybe Amazon should consider not promoting the two items together.Overall, the ASUS has been a great product and I'm looking forward to using it even more!!
computer|If you are looking for something that is portable, to use Microsoft office (or any other desktop application for that matter), this is the way to go. I will start off by saying I am a college student who had been using an android tablet to take with my to school to take notes, browse the web etc. While the tablet was excellent for portability, I just needed something a little more powerful that would allow me to use software like Microsoft Office. I saw this unit a few weeks after the Windows 8 launch, and I figured this would be perfect; and it is, for me. I'll only talk about this laptop, not whether or not Windows 8 is good.UNIT:You can tell this laptop was built well. For an 11" laptop, it's very light (only like 3 lbs), but at the same time still feels very solid. I really like that ASUS made most of the body an aluminum/metal frame. The underside of the laptop has a smooth, grippy rubber-like texture to it. Overall it looks very nice, similar to a macbook.The screen itself is fairly unremarkable. It has your standard 1366x768 resolution, so nothing incredible; the small screen size helps it out though. Viewing angles on this screen are okay, there are a few angles that are hard to view the screen from. The bezel could have been made smaller, but it isn't distracting.The touchscreen is very responsive, I have had no troubles using the laptop just using the touchscreen. It is a fingerprint magnet, like any other touchscreen though. ASUS was kind enough to include a microfiber cloth to wipe away those smudges.The keyboard is nice; coming from an ASUS transformer keyboard, this feels so much better. While it is smaller than your standard keyboard (only by a little) it still feels comfortable to type. My keystrokes are very quiet with this. Back lighting would be nice, but for a &lt;$500 computer I'm not complaining.As far as the touchpad goes, I don't have any complaints about it. I know some people have been saying that it's over-sensitive, but I almost feel like mine isn't sensitive enough. When scrolling through websites it takes a little more effort using the two-finger gesture than I thought it would. I'm kinda neutral on the touchpad, mainly because I end up using the touchscreen more often.As far as ports go, there's 2 USB 2.0 and 1 USB 3.0, which is cool. I don't have any USB 3.0 drives so I haven't been able to comment on the speed yet. It also has a card reader, VGA input, as well as HDMI.The webcam is okay, I wasn't expecting anything great from a 0.3MP camera. It does the job when I want to sit in bed and Skype the girlfriend though.I find that I like the audio quality from the speakers. As with any laptop, the sound quality from the speakers isn't going to be great. That being said though this thing can get pretty loud, and it actually sounds pretty good. I was surprised when I listened to a few songs just to test out the audio quality.I really like that the A/C adapter for this unit is so small, similar to a tablet/cell phone charger. Makes carrying that around class a whole lot easier.As far as fan noise goes: when I'm sitting in bed using it, it does sound pretty loud, and is constantly running even if im just web browsing. Though it's not terribly distracting. When I'm in class, I can't even hear the fan.COMPONENTS:If you're wanting to play the latest video games with full detail or run heavy movie editing with this, than you shouldn't even be looking at this product. That being said the 3rd gen i3 is plenty powerful enough to run your everyday tasks and then some. Even the integrated graphics aren't too shabby; you can play source games with no hitch.The best part about the hardware components of this laptop is the 500gb hard drive. Yes, it's only 5400rpm, but I like that I have that much storage for whatever. For those who want faster speeds, you can upgrade the hard drive to a 7mm SSD, which I will probably do in the future.Battery life on the unit decent. It's rated at 5 hours but I've been getting around 4 tops. ***There is a BIOS update that adds to the battery life, but nothing extreme***As far as the WiFi goes, I have noticed that my connection isn't as powerful, and I may replace the card like other users have. But it does work.OVERALL:You aren't going to get blazing speeds from a unit like this, but it is still pretty darn fast. For me, a college student who was looking for a portable option to do work on, this is perfect. And for &lt;$500, you're getting a whole lot of laptop for the money.***There is a new BIOS update (ver 205) that ASUS released a few weeks ago. I find that it does help with the "loud" fan noise as well as extending the battery life slightly. Be careful when flashing your BIOS though***
computer|I originally was looking for a tablet of some sort. I had started with an Android version like a Galaxy 2 or something similar. I then happened to pass by a Microsoft store and decided to take a look at their tablets which I found were really nice with Windows 8 RT. I almost took the plunge and purchased one of those but I then started thinking that even though I really liked the windows tablet It wasn't running the full windows operating system and the memory was very small at 32gb and 64gb and what really made me decide to wait was the price. $499 for basic model 32gb and no keyboard then went up to $599 and $699. I felt that I could get something a little better for those prices. As I searched the net and local stores I saw some ultra books that I liked but were a little more expensive and a bit larger than I wanted and then I saw a similar model to this one. It seemed very nice but there was something about it that still made me wait on purchasing it locally. As I continued my search on the net I ran into this model (x202e) and read the specs and some of the reviews. It finally made sense to me why I waited on purchasing the similar model locally (s200). I won't go into the differences but let me assure you this model is better and can purchase it for the same price as the other one.I read all the reviews and comments about this model and was pleasantly surprised with what you can do and change on this system to make it even better. So now let me first thank all the reviewers here who put there good time in putting so much detail into their reviews. I ended up purchasing this system with the intentions of upgrading the hard drive to an SSD drive and changing out the Mini PCI WiFi/Bluetooth card to the Intel card which as I read on a couple of the reviews would make this system even better than It already is. The SSD Drive that I went with was a Samsung 840 Pro 256GB. It is small and the right size (7mm) to fit and replace the standard hard drive. There are many SSD drives you can go with as long as they are the right size of 7mm. I chose the Samsung model because of recommendations by others. The WiFi/Bluetooth mini PCI card is the Intel Centrino 6235anhmw. I chose this model also because of recommendations from reviews and I liked the fact that you can use WIDI with it which lets you wirelessly connect your laptop to your TV by use of Belkin Screencast.Once I received my notebook and other items I went to work with the upgrades. I first removed the 9 small screws on the underside of the machine with a small Philips screwdriver. Then with some slight force you have to pull the cover off. Starting at the back corner and moving your way around seems to work best. With the cover removed I then proceeded to install the mini PCI card. It's very simple. Remove the screw, slide out the old card and slide the new one in making sure it fits in all the way and then reapply the screw. Now comes the hard drive. Remove it by unscrewing 3 screw, pull on the plastic tab and slide it out. On the hard drive that you remove, it has some metal hardware on its sides that you will need to install the new one. Remove the hardware and put them on the new SSD Drive. I did one at a time to make sure I had them facing in the right direction. Once you install the metal hardware on the new drive, slide it back in the location from where the old drive was in. Put the 3 screw back on and now you are ready to put the back cover on the machine. It does not take very long to change these items out but what does take some time is reinstalling Windows and the Drivers.I did a clean install of Windows 8 Pro. You can download the upgrade from windows and do a clean install but it does take some modification on your part to be able to do that. You can find more information on clean install from upgrade on the net. If you don't want to struggle with that, purchase Windows 8 pc builder and you should have no problems doing a clean install. If you don't care about a clean install which I personally like better myself then you can clone your' original hard drive with a cloning software and that should work just fine too. Make sure you have your operating system in a DVD, Flash Drive or cloned on new SSD drive before you remove the old hard drive.I almost forgot this important part of doing a clean install of windows. When you first start up the notebook it will take you into the BIOS. You need to disable some things in there for you to be able to install windows from an external USB DVD drive or flash drive.If I recall correctly, F2 to BIOS if it doesn't automatically take you there, go to Boot tab, disable Fast Boot, enable Launch CSM and under Security tab, disable Secure Boot, (aka UEFI). Once you make these changes you should be able to boot and install Windows from external USB DVD drive or flash drive. I personally use DVD to do my install because for some reason I could not get Windows to install correctly with a flash drive. These BIOS instructions were provided to me by GC who responded to my help when I was struggling with this. Thank you GC.Once you have Windows installed and activated get all the updates for it and proceed to download and install all the drivers for the system from ASUS.If you do plan on using WIDI on this device with the Belkin Screencast. You need to first install the latest PRO drivers for the Intel mini PCI card you installed. Then Install the WIDI software. It takes some time to get it set up but it works perfectly.Hope my review helps many of you. Best of luck!
computer|The Asus Vivobook X202E has a nice brushed aluminum body with a soft touch bottom; the build quality is quite high, no cheap plastic painted to look like metal. The chicklet keyboard on this 11.6" laptop is shrunk slightly but even with my large hands there was plenty of space to type at full speed, and thanks to the metal body, the keyboard has only the tiniest bit of flex when pressed very hard.The responsive touch screen coupled with Windows 8 is a nearly perfect showcase of Microsoft's new OS and Apps, however due to the 5400rpm HDD, there can be slight lag when launching apps or installing updates. The 4GB of RAM and i3 processor have proven to be more than capable of running the majority of programs and apps users will want with no hiccups.This is not a powerhouse of a computer; it is not a gaming laptop or a video editing device. But if you are looking for an attractive, light, reliable laptop that feels like something brand new, this is it thanks to ASUS' attention to detail and the built-in touchscreen.Edit: I have not had enough time to fully review the laptop yet, but wanted to throw something up since there is a stark absence of both customer and professional reviews. There are lots of Windows 8 devices out, but the Vivobook is one of the most affordable ways you can get the whole experience.
computer|I bought one of these this past weekend from a Microsoft retail store (where it is $499) and could not be happier so far. It is to be used mostly by my wife, but I plan on doing some writing and occasional work on it.Both of us love it. It is thin and light, but very solid. The build quality is way beyond what I expected from a $500 laptop. The shallow keypress on the chiclet keyboard takes some getting used to, but I was acclimated after only a few minutes. The touchscreen is responsive and, I have to admit, a lot of fun. I have had my eye on various tablets lately, but this thing blows them away. It is essentially as portable as a 10" tablet, but way more functional with its full version of Windows 8. Contrary to what some might fear, we never had any problems with the screen being pushed backwards when touched. The hinge is stiff enough to withstand touch, but never a hindrance.The trackpad feels slightly imprecise, and sometimes the Windows 8 gestures, when made on the trackpad, need to be repeated. But overall it is one of the nicer trackpads I have used on a laptop.Windows 8 itself is a lot of fun to use with a touch screen. The apps are helpful and mostly well-designed. Our one issue so far has been that deleted photos still show up on the Pictures livetile. That is a pretty bad oversight, but one solely at the hands of Microsoft, not Asus.The included Asus software is extremely unintrusive. Bloatware is definitely at a minimum.Everything runs very smoothly so far, despite the absence of an SSD.Ultimately, this is the most fun, most exciting laptop I have ever owned (had various laptops years ago by Toshiba and HP, and also a PowerMac G4). It also happens to be the cheapest laptop I have ever bought. Never would have thought I could get a package this great with such a low pricetag. If you are in the market for a new Windows portable, you should definitely give this one a serious look.
computer|Overall Impression-WOOOOWWWW! What a slick device. It's a toy, it's a business laptop, it's an HTPC, it has a touchscreen, ports galore, crazy fast speed - what else could you want?!?! I've been building my own high-power gaming desktops for 15 years, but man, this thing truly is an all-in-one device that doesn't disappoint. It only costs $500-ish, but has 95% of the features of $1,400 ultrabooks. Unless there is a specific feature you need, this laptop could fit the majority of people's computing needs, excel at most of them, and even provide some nifty, state of the art features to put a smile on your face.Our Intended Uses-Wife uses it for business, some pleasure; We use it as HTPC when needed for watching Hulu, ESPN3, etc. online, or for pushing email/Office to the big screen for work use. I use it for some touchscreen games.Screen, Keyboard and Touchpad-I kind of use touchscreen and touch pad and keyboard interchangeably (it's very natural - games are nice). It's normally easiest to point with my finger on the touchsreen and then type on the keyboard - this technique pretty much eliminates the touchpad altogether.-Screen is OK (coming from a gamer who's used to 24"+ high-resolution, high-contrast, very bright screens), not overwhelmingly knock your socks off superb, brightness is fine, resolution is fine for this screen size, color reproduction isn't perfect, blacks aren't perfect. All in all, only enthusiasts would notice this things small screen faults. Nobody else would even pick up on them, so this shouldn't keep anyone from buying this. The screen doesn't wash out in a sun-lit living rooming, nor now in this dimly-lit room does the screen bother me (brightness turned down).-Touch Pad is just any other touchpad. Although some of the gestures do match the touch screen, which is nice so as to not be confusing (scroll up and down matches the screen, not regular touchpad scrolling). I did upload the Samsung drivers, which did help a little bit of the jitteryness and sensitivity.-Keyboard (chiclet keys, good size, nice resistance, don't click at the bottom)-Haven't used on screen keyboard, so I can't spak to how it works. Not sure why anyone would use that when you have a wicked good chiclet keyboard under your fingers anway.Storage-The laptop comes with a 500GB, 7200RPM, SATAIII drive. Within hour of turning on the laptop, I had already powered down, taken off teh back (10 screws??) and installed a Samsung 7mm 840 SSD. This SSD pegs at it's rated specs (540/130 read/write). This laptop now boots to a useable screen in 8 seconds, the length of a bull ride!-Having taken out the original 5400RPM SATA drive, I put it in an Anker external USB 3.0 encloser which produces speeds of 110/110 R/W (not sure if hard drive maxed out or port maxed out).-I used Samsung's data transfer software to clone the 500GB factory image to my 120GB SSD. In all it only took 30-45 minutes for the transfer.Size-Although listed as a 11.6", the frame is more of a 13"-14" laptop. The 11.6" slip case I orignially bought did NOT fit, so I upgrade to a 14" courier bag with enough space including pockets for accessories (charger, external HDD, etc.).-The laptop weighs 3lbs, which I guess some people think is heavy, but it's really not. If you were try to hold it with your arm outstretched for 20 minutes, then yes, it would feel heavy (a bird would feel heavy at that length and duration, though). Sitting on my lap, it's not heavy, and when on a table/desk, I don't even feel the weight, so of course it's not a bother there.Processor-Intel Processor coupled with an SSD makes this laptop respond instantenously to requests to bootup MS Office applications (instantaneous, literally). It's a great processor (Sandy Bridge core??) that is low-power, high-output, and even has an integrated graphics processor (IGP). Not much to say here, as contemporary processors have been "fast enough" for 10 years or so, to the user's perception of speed is more of a result of storage/RAM speed and input response than the processor itself. No complaints in this department. Moving on.Speakers and Camera/Microphone-The laptop comes with phenomenal speakers. Now, these aren't reference monitors for sure, but for an 11.6" laptop, the sound reproduction far exceeds expectations. They'll surely impress you.-The camera was a letdow, though. I think it maxes out a 0.9MP while in video mode. Still pictures don't look much better. I guess this is one of those features your would have to pay $200-$300 more to get a good 12MP camera or something built in.-Microphone is just OK. Not impressive, not crappy. It's kind of cheap (as in the quality of audio picked up), but it gets the job done.-You could use this laptop for Skype, but the person on the other end will probably see a granulated picture.Windows 8-Initial impressions: This laptop was my first real experience with Windows 8, and I have to say it's not all that it could be. In all, jumping back and forth between the Start Screen and Desktop is confusing and aggravatig. Win8 being so different than anything Windows users have used before, it should really come with a detailed tutorial available somewhere as a Tile or on the Desktop. Neither of those exist, so we just kind of figured out stuff as we went along.-The Win8 Start Screen is geared towards media consumption and social crap, all of which I consider a waste of time. My wife and I are busy people, so all of this Facebook, Skybe, Youtube, Hulu look-at-me-type-stuff is just keeping people down so they don't go out into the world and do stuff useful with their lives.-Windows 8 has a split personality - it's not sure if it wants to be Windows 8 or Windows 7. By that I mean some applications/apps run solely in the Win8 environment, while others (even if there is a tile for it on the Win8 Start Screen) jump to the familiar Win7 desktop and open the program there. To me, a PC builder, that's confusing. To my wife, it's frustrating. There is a Win8 Internet Explorer, and Win7 IE - the two, from what I can tell, do not share any favorites, settings, etc., so we spend time hunting our favorites only to realize it's in THE OTHER browser.-Win8 Adobe isn't as fully-featured as Win7 Adobe, so when Win8 Adobe wouldn't open some files correctly, I disabled it and made Win7 Adobe the default PDF reader . . . but then it always jumps to desktop to open Win7 Adobe. Another frustration, because when I'm done, I have to go back to whatever I was doing in Win8 by using some swipe gesture or something.-There is no Start button on the desktop, so unless you know how to navigate through folders and create shorcuts on your desktop, the desktop is largely devoid of anything.-Excel/Word open on the desktop, even if you're on the Start Screen (an aggravation).-There is no default clock on the Start Screen, so you have to hunt through the Store to find one. It took me trying out about 5 apps to find one that would show a live tile with a clock that updated manually. Sounds like a mouthful of a task, but it's a really simple idea. Tell me: WHY does the Start Screen NOT have a clock and calendar?-Apps (on the Win8 Start Screen) are different and independent from the applications most users are accustomed to (on the Win7 Desktop). Again, there are two Internet Explorers, two Adobes, two Mail programs - it makes NO SENSE!-The Store is available for whatever Apps you're missing, although I wasn't able to find full-blown Applications. Excited to have a toucscreen laptop, I went hunting for Angry Birds. The original AB isn't even available! The only ones that I saw were like the Star Wars version and somethign else, both of which I would have had to pay for. What a ripoff! Just give me the dang ad-laiden versions like from Android and let me have my Angry Birds!-Even though you can somewhat manually organize the Tiles, there are some built-in restriction where Win8 tries to "help" you organize the Tiles, locking you into a preset geometry. Dude, let ME decide how I was MY STUFF organized. Why are there restrictions in the first place?Software-Bloatware is minimal on the laptop. It comes pre-loaded with some Asus LifeFrame, caculator, and a few other Asus-braned things. They're not bothersome so I've not uninstalled them.-The laptop comes pre-loaded with Adera, a Myst-type game where you have to search around, solve puzzles, etc. It's extremely well-suited to touchscreen input, and the game actually looks pretty decent. However, once you beat the first episode, you have to pay $5.99 for each of the last two episodes. That's like how a drug dealer acts - gets you hooked on a taste, but if you want more, you have to pay. I uninstalled the game, even though I wanted to see how it ended, just based on the bait-and-switch principle.-The laptop has McAfee securit software preloaded with some trial offer. I uninstalled that and enabled Windows Defender and all of its little buddies, as it's free, isn't a resource hog, and for the most part stays out of my way.-Office 2010 trial is loaded on the laptop, but I uninstalled that and loaded Office 2007. It works fine with the touchscreen (it's actually pretty pleasant working in Excel with a touchscreen). Office applications load in seemingly less than a second, which has a lot to do with the SSD.PORTS-The laptop has one USB 3.0 port and 3 USB 2.0. It also has VGA and HDMI, ethernet, headphone, and a MMC/SD slot. What else do you need?USB-The 1:3 ratio of 3.0 to 2.0 is the perfect mix, as I use the single 3.0 port for the aforementioned external HDD(lots of data movement requiring high speeds) and the other 2.0 ports for slower devices (wireless mouse/keyboard receiver/transmitter for when using hte laptop as HTPC, charging phones, etc.).HDMI-HDMI works great (Intel HD4000) for streaming ESPN3 to big screen TV, although things did look a shade darker than my other input devices would (and I even tweaked the picture to compensate for the darkness). I'm not sure if this is the "fault" of the streaming broadcast or a limitation in the HD4000 IGP. I was watching a football bowl game via streaming ESPN3 over HDMI to the TV and my wife tought I was watching via over-the-air broadcast, because the pictre looked so good. Now, don't kid yourself, it's not literally as good as OTA, but unless you're looking for sprites or artifacts of streaming data, you won't notice and picture degradation.-However, when teh screen is shut and I'm pushing the video over HDMI the to the TV&lt; I can see that thetouch screen is still receiving inputs, so I have to put a small piece of folded paper between the screen and palmrest to keep the lid open.MMC/SD-I've not used this card slot, but I do have a camera with an SD card, so I'm sure the reader will be seeing lots of duty.BATTERY-Yes, the battery is under the laptop's skin and is not intended to be routinely replaced, although it is removable. Yes, it only lasts 3-5 hours while on battery depending on what you're doing, but for our uses, that lines up exactly with about a day of mixed plugged in and unplugged use so this "limitation" isn't really noticed. Maybe if I was traveling to Europe and kept using the laptop to watch movies or something, THEN I would notice it. But, like I said, the 3-5 hour battery is actually pretty good for a fully-featured, touchscreen laptop.Fan/Heat-I can hear the fan running most of the time, but it's not bothersome. Using the laptop on a hardened laptop (literally in my lap) pad, the case has enough circulation from underneath that the case hardley even gets warm. It's usually cool to the touch, even after hours of use. With the 7mm Samsung 840 SSD in it, the ONLY thing I hear is the fan (it has no other moving parts).Wireless Card-Some folks put in WiDi / 803.11N card. I don't need that b/c I don't pass large amounts of data on my network, nor are any of my displays WeDI capable. So, I can't speed to that, although the HDMI port pushes a nice picture the big screen, and the wireless card (G??) is sufficiently fast for my uses. I did notice that when installed the Samsung 840 7mm SSD, that the factory wireless card is just RIGHT THERE right out in the open whiel you've got teh back of the case off, so replacing it should be hard.RECAP-Glad I bought it. Small quirks or lack of high-end features aren't bothersome as you would have to pay big money to overcome them. I typed this while review on the laptop using the chiclet keys.
computer|Can't say much more about this computer than has been said already. I used an awesome youtube review ([...]) in my decision to buy this one and I would suggest checking it out for pros and cons.I am really just writing this review to mention an issue that other will have. This computer has a fairly wide bezel (the edge area around the screen). Therefore, it doesn't fit into every case made for 11.6in laptops, especially ones for a Macbook air. You may do better looking for a 12-13in case if you're having trouble fitting it in. I will be using a 13.3in case to avoid scratching my new comp. Just a tip... hope it helps.
computer|GAMA adjustment/screen calibration:The screen always looks like in a bright mist and it hurts my eye, so I went to control panel-intel graphics-advanced mode-display-color enhancement and adjusted the following: brightness -20, contrast 51, gama 0.9Now it looks so much better.What I like:size, weight, touchpad/touchscreen. Only had it for a week, still learning windows 8 but I kind like it. Some people mentioned that the touchpad is too sensitive but I found it fine. Maybe because I am used to another asus eee pc which has similar sensitivity. Does the Samsung touchpad driver have other useful touchpad gestures though?What I don't like:Fan keeps running and the bottom still gets a little warm although the BIOS is already 206. Also I keep hearing this high pitch sound (a tiny sound but still annoying especially in quiet places) which sounds like something getting spinned up a bit then slow down, repeatedly. Not sure if that's from HDD or the fan. The HDD sometimes also makes clicking sound which is louder than I expected. Maybe I'll get a SSD later.Edit: It charges very slowly! Other reviewer mentioned this but I thought it's like my old eee pc that it charges fast to somewhere about 80% in 1 hour then slowly go up to 100%. THAT IS NOT THE CASE. The x202e charges at a constant speed, and it takes about 4 hours to fully charge it. I can live with this but still think it's ridiculous!Battery life:Surfing internet or working on Microsoft Office, about 4 hours. Light reading on webpages with minimal flash ads, about 5 hours.Bottom line:Still worth the money, will recommend to friends.
computer|There are a lot of good reviews on here about the VivoBook - I just want to add my experience with this computer.I received mine as a gift from an online store (not Amazon) and was so excited when it arrived. I have never used Windows 8 so I was having fun playing around with it when all of the sudden my computer screen went Blue and said it had to restart. I thought it was maybe from updating since the computer was new. So I waited for it to restart and then started playing with it again. Not 6 minutes later the blue screen showed up again and the computer restarted. This continued to happen repeatedly so I called ASUS.I talked to the technician and was told I would have to mail the computer in (at my expense!) to be repaired. The fact that I had to pay the shipping was very surprising to me considering I had only had the computer for less than an hour, and it had come out of the box with the restarting problem. Apparently that is the policy of ASUS.In order to try and avoid the shipping cost, I decided to enlist the help of my computer savvy son who discovered that McAfee Anti-Virus causes the "blue screen of death" on some computers because it has problems with Windows 8. He uninstalled the pre-installed McAfee and the problem never occurred again. Hopefully this info will be helpful to someone that might have the same problem. (The store I received my computer from did find a contact from ASUS that I was able to talk to. After a couple of conversations I heard back from them and they offered to send me a shipping label, but the problem was fixed by then.)Now my computer works great - I love it! Having a touch screen is a great upgrade from my old laptop. I do miss having a DVD/CD drive, but most everything can be downloaded now anyways.Overall a great computer for the price!
