340 asus-transformer i bought tablet launch day waited review it the speed fantastic  tegra  beast comes games i ran emulators seems run anything i throw it the design also great very thin  good grip feeling thanks textured back some people saying plastic  getting little bleed screen only time i ever seen i intentionally push hard front back if 're handling tablet normal person would  'll never see bleed through now  ics tegra  beautiful together it smooth  asus processor modes the battery life average tablet i usually get  days i charge it i wish deep sleep mode  screen turned would shut system down but still receive notifications stay connected wifi screen off it seemed little buggy launch day  asus already released two updates seems fixed minor issues overall  price tablet  i n't think get better 
341 asus-transformer very happy purchase android tablet i purchased transformer prime bestbuy   one nice spun aluminum back   found many issues this newer model transformer tf may show specs bit less prime point view tf lot better  most notably  gps actually works    i guess since made back panel polycarb  signal n't blocked very accurate works great navi apps the speaker port looks small n't let fool ya  delivers lot sound  louder ipad   i happy that the wifi one sensitive i 've ever used  picks signal i never knew around me i wish included dual band ghz  a   it thin used care i recommend nice protective case built screen cover like otter box rear cam mp  led flash like prime  mp front cam  nice job my favorite feature micro sdhc card slot it accepts gb additional storage space note  bestbuy sells version tf only gb price amazon the one  amazon  comes gb internal storage  much better deal ca n't go wrong money  i recommend highly 
342 asus-transformer i researching tablets quite now im not apple fan looking something competitive then i found asus transformer family i almost got prime hesitated started seeing wifi gps issues due metal backing then tf became available after waiting start seeing reviews  i finally purchased it  dock  i love it the screen responsive and plenty bright i dont forsee using outdoors often and indoors i actually turn brightness down so dont let nit deterrent and even screen ips super ips+  still looks awesome did `` sleep death '' happen twice  researching  seems fix hard reboot pushing button pinhole side hasnt done yet since then i definitely recommend tablet im autocad user i saw autocad ws app try it this quad core cpu g ddr ram show power there sample drawings full d renderings use touchscreen rotate zoom hesitation if pricing available tf infinity i may waited but tablet great i started using email works flawless still learning capabilities 
343 asus-transformer i got mine yesterday i love it it 's speedy responsive everything worksjust couple thoughts  i 'm fan proprietary charging cable and usb/wall plug do microusbs provide enough power  i would love adapter would let use charger electronics  hp touchpad  use  there two spots led bleed bottom edge device not noticeable 's  unmistakable screen darkotherwise  's beautiful  light  functional zippy 
344 asus-transformer ok here goesfirst  i going comparison toshiba thrive tablet i owned previous tablet experience withsecond  i played unit one evening  several hours  one evening far but  said  i feel i messed enough dispell alot reviewers complaints unitdo realize alot darned picky electronic gadgets days  you expect perfect perform maximum specifications  especially pay say $  product  expect gold  come peoplei experienced complaining concerning `` light bleed '' i ca n't believe actually returned unit fot alone again i say  come people to compare thrive  light bleed speak  i noticed screen first came 's brightest background loads rest icons  screen beautiful  i n't get many return units issue  as long something displayed screen  i kept mine set half brightness doors really  bright beyond that i tried letting auto brightness configure darker bedroom  kept setting screen dark i found much pleasant able set brightness manually now  said  alot complained colors appearing washed compared units huh  i compared screen thrive  noticed no difference one remember crank bightness way  tends brighten colors point thay may appear washed out so  maybe need critical deal turning brightness little i yet try outside bright sun i mentioned reviews  any lcd/led device days trying viewed sun almost impossible i smart phone set auto brightness sun  brightens screen way least see enough tell going on but  talking brightness causes warmth skins cause fires areas world give person rd degree burns so  question  world anyone expect electronic devices able withstand offering enough brightness beat power sun    again  criticalso  enough issues display nowwhen i plugged unit charger way  mine came  feet cable  complaining came  foot cable   feet standard people  anyway  tablet automatically came  booted  entering various information screen  went immediately system firmware update i happy reviews i read problems earlier firmware then i entered google information  immediately downloaded updated google apps google play store that kind cool except i n't necessarily like i guess i manually uninstall ones i n't use later timeas far rebooting problems apps running  i must used tablet good  hours clicking playing verious apps n't problem one  i even internet browsing standard browser really n't see hitch glitch mentioned the thing i wanted mention i found charger seems get awfly warm i hope n't future issue well so  maybe 's luck i ended good tablet malfuntioning one maybe  days weeks go i chance check  i come back update reviewas far person people complaining speaker  wow  i mean  i disappointed   set right side split right left sides unit but  said  even tablet sound specially compared thrive cell phone  i found sound full rich much like full sized stereo speaker i shocked amazed sound asus really excelled engineering sound come like does on thrive two speakers seperated bottom tablet especailly rest body like lying bed stomach  sound gets muffled distorted it also tinty cell phone sounding but tablet  very full sound tablet i ca n't complain all as far person complaining covering speaker   right hand  well one  n't hold way for another  i found able hold way cup hand around speaker  much like i cell phone  sound trajected towards front get really good louder sound way but tablet  truly n't necessaryi hope i n't end tablet  mentioned  ends rebooting time apps ca n't run time that worry almost kept purchasing it i wished times critical people would n't write reviews opinions n't close unit actually functions people ca n't get good idea possibilities unit may beyond little bit `` light bleed '' i 'm annoyed little bit lack instruction manuals products provide consumer days the thing included box tablet  charger cable  soft cloth screen  two small pamphlets  one english one languages and  tablet media drive  ca n't load cd pdf file inside read no  find line download make sure adobe reader datei miss idea able pop back panel  thrive  change color able replace battery actually cover thrive little difficult pull  snapping back pretty easy the thrive also offer standard usb hdmi ports connect computer  could read connecting mini usb port i guess  unless connecting usb drive  full size usb n't really necessaryother things i mentioned  i feel 's good solid unit people complain made plastic instead metal again  way critical i n't feel felt flimsy easy hold onto what n't made plastic days    even item made coated look like metal  is n't metal  i actually tried bend said mentioned could done i felt must way tight grip n't really slide hands easy again  i need say  if holding hard actually squeezing corners  i felt n't really easy  big hands need loosen bit  and person complained fingerprint magnet  clean your hands use  have owned touch screen devices  you either need use touch pen stylis avoid fingerprinting it i found tablet n't show fingerprints worse touching thrive smartphone  extensive touching icons extensive sliding moving finger around besides  come soft screen cloth take minute wipe off it 's either get screen protector n't show fingerprints much but  careful  thrive  toshiba branded screen protectors  removing leave indefinite sticky film behind glass difficult clean off i ended bringing mine work used soaked screen product goo gone i n't know else clean off after hours brought back like new needless say  experience  i will not using screen protector unit  long i stand itother things  i say i would recommend table friend go ahead buy try it you might like it  provided get good working unit    update  i know already long winded review i wanted leave short updatei used tablet week now other issue original browser crashing  even system firmware update  i still feel tablet awesome i download google chrome beta seems work fine a note asus  i n't feel 's right company expect users download another browser issues stock one crashing they right thing researching fix issue for  updating firmware n't work i thought going stable browser still crashes i n't issues programs crashing  even ones i used thrive  older android system   i think everything seems golden  except browser i also n't feel i 'm getting full usage battery advertised that even days much extensive use brightness screen set auto dim low light situations which i feel video hardware work oposite way  the screen   lighten low light situations darken bright lighting situations but  i stated  also need bright screen sunshine order see screen who knows but  's great tablet

366 asus-transformer tf reviewi got tf may th used  days now in personal opinion i like tablet thing wrong many apps made android tablets yet if android user enjoy freedom android definitely enjoy tablet  rely heavily itunes easiness backing syncing  simplicity ios tablet might  specifically androidphysical aspect  the plastic back body feel cheap even though many complained it the design nice feels pretty sturdy some said plastic bend inward true significant enough real concern you notice plastic bending unless actually look it in end i know back made plastic increase wifi/gps reception works fine the major problem i tablet build fact decided use gorilla glass went hardened glass instead the glass used feel slick sliding finger across like ipad  also fingerprint magnet get annoying either way problems stated n't mean much i always buy screen protectors another awkward thing build put mono speaker right tablet positioned landscape mode when listening audio/video landscape mode feels awkward right ear gets higher volume left  n't big problem portrait mode although i wo n't complain much speaker better prime clear even highest leveldisplay quality video quality seems fine  i watched lot youtube trailers hd even watched sherlock holmes games shadows p avatar p far video quality seems fine tablet even hiccup i compared tablets far i tell screen good i know lot people complained asus put super ips+ display nits brightness tablet fact tablet 's nits plenty not mention house i use  %  yes  %  brightness nits outside use take toll battery i actually used tablet sunlight  order see clearly sun must angle  screen max brightness  background preferably white light coloroperating system  ice cream sandwich   this first android device i say wow  kudos google i

crossed hoped good working tablet luckily tablet still okay although second day i screen glitch screen would gitter down a quick reset took care i problems th day i got random restart app freezing to crashes reboots i would suggest upgrading firmware trading another one definitely give tf another chance i also read reviews many people wait/close message many times browsing case different  i would suggest using another browser like dolphin lot stable less likely crash  dolphin yet crash also wait/close message pop press wait start working immediately  avoid wait/close error bit patient let page

1210 tablet_blackberry i decided tablet last minute christmas gift fire sale offered name brand electronics store toward end december yes i read reviews tablet good n't `` ready prime time '' blah blah competing models running twice cost i figured   you also read myriad critcisim suggesting ca n't good app shortcomings 'll need wait os  anywhere near competative anyone remember waiting ios  even  iphone address bugs  push email  etc  guess 's ok though  sheeshi 've week gotten used form feel whole it 's solidly built feels good hands overall  i 'd say rim makings huge winner 's  performance  simply unbelievable multitasking flawless play hd video  surf web  open documents  thing wo n't skip beat the interface pleasure use bezel gesturing simple commands want minimize app  swipe bottom bezel upward screen want bring options bar  swipe top bezel down similar functions scrolling moving apps multitasking mode done left right well there 's also diagonal bezel swiping bring things like keypad  status bar etc oh  functions also mirrored whether hold tablet portrait landscape really coolgraphic diplay  beautiful rich full colors nice high definition love itcustomization  good needs little work i 'm hoping os  address this right  move icons different pre set categories 'games ' 'media ' 'blackberry bridge ' etc currently 's way setup own really minor gripe is there 's also sound customization beeps boops i 'm sure 's even necessity after  n't ringer  of course  change wallpaper typical stuff goes thatapps  one biggest complaints lack apps they add day blackberry app world guaranteed android support os  i doubt i 'll downloading plethora fart apps another month two ca n't wait  sarcasm intended  compatability  android coming os   currently supports flash  html  plays mps  wma  i 'm sure others ca n't comment video format audio format yet i n't tried i ca n't imagine others might supported yet wo n't soonvideo  records p outputs micro hdmi hdmi tv simply awesome the thing also mirror display television much richer viewing experiencecamera  dual cameras fore aft mp rear mp  i think  front has video chat function i n't tried yet since currently  works playbook users i understand might third party apps used may issue pic quality 'd expect not 's bad  's  n't good low light conditions i know  expect  right  with well lit subject  's fantastic slight low light condition gets grainy the playbook camera flash particular gripe mine however  since n't primary camera family  maybe 's concern all still deciding one camera settings little lame too auto  whiteboard  sports there 's also stabilization button much elseform factor  love  repeat  love  '' screen you put tablet pocket  carry around easily read text wellbridging  another criticism tablet accuses rim catering current blackberry phone owners providing native communications software emailing  texting  calendar  etc i would agree one consider rims biggest mistake likely helped lead poor market sales i use blackberry n't affect os  supposed incorporate native ware everyone he*l bent on speaking behalf bridge users everywhere though  i attest genius 's seamless simple use although software basically stripped versions apps used blackberry  fact leave phone kitchen hold office lap treat you also use bridge blackberry web browser  bit   i gripes functionality bridging apps missing key features like spell check expected intuitiveness overall though  work well docommunication  another critical issue reviewers tablet wifi again  since i blackberry  i tether internet phone i complete internet access i 'm wifi range no biggie me plus i n't need extra data plan use it bluetooth adp coming os  wifi good strong without dropoutsbattery life  do n't really know i 'd say heavy use  maybe  hours light use like   either way  seems par everything else 's theretyping  good responsive easy  need spell checky/auto correct thingy 'll good go os internet experience  without doubt  best the experience sitting pc flash flashy  html html'y in short 's mobile  really mobile anymore  surfing like in fact  's good many apps missing loaders people complaining become unnecessary since accessed direct web experience not true  manythings i 'd like see  understanding addressed os   due february last i heard    software improvements bridge apps make little intuitive adp bluetooth android compatibility open door apps many companies still loathe develop apps playbook netflix  pandora  goole maps come mind however  made work direct net access  case netflix  streaming pc playbook android issue address this a little customization categories  naming icons  avatars  etc i understand 'll able add quick links contacts os  instancein conclusion  i really think rim winner it 's bad tablet panned badly critics partly due rims poor marketing strategy  native email  early release product likely n't quite ready yet good ol ' fashioned rim bashing  i pay less attention rely user input instead most user reviews read positive system good reason attracted it i ca n't compare tablets galaxy ipad since i n't owned either i 've dabbled ipad bit seems every bit rock solid well thought out given two however price point speaks loudly $  vs $   mmmm  i 'm pretty happy choicei ranked tablet  star i doubt os  comes february wants list addressed i 'd problem pushing

1382 tablet_blackberry i bought back february used great condition  except one dead pixel allow certain amount screens i guess i got unlucky getting one dead pixel  annoying as soon i got i loved form  weight  feel  texture back casing the screen beautiful  aside dead pixel  crisp  '' fine  portable practical the main reason i bought i wanted tablet badly could n't afford ipads good androids i saw gb playbook available $  i could n't pass up it serves purpose  portable  capable laptop do the first major problem i noticed work ad hoc networks problem i use friends wifi share laptop devices room i able use program called connectify create access points playbook connect i able use house way  i use mac school playbook compatible mac 's version internet sharing the next problem i noticed piece dust somehow got screen  i kept sleeve  case   clean often yet piece dust close dead pixel makes part screen annoying look  time i noticed pieces dust getting glass somehow ca n't blown out does n't make sense   year old ipod touch lint filled pockets everyday n't single piece dust glass it the operating system fast full flash multitasking  nice i think done  still takes way long boot  uses nearly mb ram without apps running android player sometimes crashes the ram problem  i thought gb would fine nearly half always used os  degrades potential multitasking many apps run once the browser biggest hog one problems i trying dig old post browser facebook running ram page froze  i hoping would get rid top page keep loading i scrolling  luckily since  i n't problem must fixed i 'm impressed battery life  i 'd say i 'd lucky get  maybe  hours it needs charged every day  charging rather fast atleast  note  i always bluetooth turn wifi standby using  hours school needs charged i get home i wo n't enough use rest day plus looses battery life overnight  every morning  % i went bed garbage ipod touch last month standby i 'd shut terrible boot time i deal nightly drain the last problem app world it gotten better since  still needs many apps  lacks lot big apps ipad android  however good android apps ported over over time i found productivity utility apps i needed i 'm satisfyed i  n't overwhelmed many choices like app store  this good bad  a lot good apps cost money i n't credit card far i know n't make app world cars like itunes prepaid cars i wo n't able buy apps i know i stated lot problems i wanted tell i n't like playbook  thats it there much good  i use everyday school  portable i like form factor the cameras excellent  among best  especially mp front camera going beyond i appreciate flash browser  adobe reader  file browsing ability os browser air browser it feels like `` computer '' able get access devices files  using delete songs device  unlike ipod i like

another big bonus since n't g/g version playbook states  they launched g/lte canada  cons  lack app support  lone elephant room big one blackberry n't offer apps playbook available droid apple it

thing no bloomberg app  really  as someone financial services i use one everyday phone now granted  playbook 's internet experience spot many apps unnecessary 's excuse sure i go full website sometimes i want app onlylack sales adoption  n't huge con worth pointing out because lack app support variety reasons  n't many playbooks floating around circulation i remember nd quarter playbook

sides device i never know i 'm person i know planet owns one  truth told  i actually see someone walk airport one  time i ever seen another one i thought i said something went high five random

could nail next one 's uphill battle for  i sticking pb actually bought nd one my gig i bought  months ago go family member i keeping gig myself i liked tablet full launch price i love half off it

2463 tablet_zeepad ***updated*** see original review***i bought son christmas came mail today it expandable micro sd card slot  tf  people probably need it  keep reading  i bought one  sandisk microsdhc gb class  card sd adapter  sdsdq   i 've always found sandisk pretty reliable the onboard memory states  gb available memory gb keep mind 's important you memory cards dirt cheap easily get want cheaper going `` '' routei took pad play some it comes installed angry birds  netflix  facebook  fruit ninja  play store  adobe flash player course regular items  wallpaper  camera  clock widget  browser  wifi  etc  some said packaging knockoff look a better choice words would `` generic '' packaging it 's ripoff knockoff connotes images backstreet deals guys trunk that 's fair assessment product the instruction booklet admittedly small needs instruction booklet run tablet  my concerns withstands test time  year old it seems well built  one minor design flaw screen outer frame n't flush gap it definitely collect dirt hard get out  not deciding factor i see getting ocd nerves the camera also average best i never understood people needed great camera tablet  is tablet really going go camera things like vacation   we bought  yr old son as i think 's important people understand tablet competes with it would mistake compare ipad good bad reasonsit n't competition ipad rather ipod touch we went instead itouch saved lot $  it $  gb android tablet  expandable   vs $  gb itouch  expandable  i think made right choice i think like it good luck everyone be smarti update review christmas tablet sees regular daily use****update***it 's always good come back reevaluate product newness worn think objectively my overall feeling tablet n't changed much i would still recommend target audience i mentioned above again  looking backup laptop alternative ipad  probably n't you but read description know 're getting  still great producthere impressions past week regular use  screen  i start screen first i turned screen it durable plastic however i go galaxy tablet come back i glad build glad kids zeepad it 's perfect themas know though probably show marks i 'm fine that after comes stylus the screen protector comes lacking looking  unsuccessfully fit   screen protectors  '' tablet do not fit zeepad it slightly smaller  '' keep mind also finding case bit challenging universal cases hold corners cause rub power button  may design flaw   nevertheless none things would cause fretwhile i glad screen durable  others may turned used high glossy  colorful screens the zeepad look dull comparison buying  one issue given pause wifi it works great quirky times one time turned selecting would immediately turn again it would continue finally shut down after little worked fine maybe one time thing it happens also clock constantly reverts january    i n't know significance date  lol  i finally solved checking setting sync clock network connected wifi again  maybe isolated eventthe battery  i would take / star screen build another / star battery it definitely n't seem last long kids forget charge things if travel lot could issue you you might get converter get around this  finding car charger might difficult the ac power cord small  round variety  one last thing  memory i said original review memory issue  comes stock around gb available  could worked around memory card that still technically true reality proven little difficult run apps solely memory card this could android limitation i still new android ecosystem there app called app sd made

basically minecraft  plays  nothing else we monitored low power usage apps received results in short  would fortunate get  assuming tablets norm batteriesthere also issue charger it sometimes prefers certain outlets some outlets wo n't charge correctly i assuming adapter issue since live usa the adapter seems generic i currently trying find backup casethis still n't change much initial review i wanted keep review updated i always appreciated people would continue open minded toward products let others know goingthe battery issue may disappointing i said  really depends 're buying for my son learned work around keeping charged honesty kids need limits anyway long car trips could pose problem converter would trick

3816 camera_nikon_d7000 i bought camera local dealer months ago got chance give real workout trip mn recently i think great camera backfocus issues mentionedwhen i shopping camera i compared apsc canon price range  d maybe    also compared olympus omd em fuji xpro  seem great reputationsthe fuji really  really  tempting end i read many reviews many sites strange focusing behavior various problems quirks the fuji also lacked imagestabilization body lenses available time the oly looked like nice camera paper i held hands  lot smaller i expected felt light  i wanted solid feeling camera  preference   it also uses micro / sensor noticeably smaller apsc sensors used d  corporate brethren   i n't know much difference smaller micro / sensor makes real life  another nail coffin oly methe issue i oly fuji bodies small lot functionality done via menus  i hate menus cameras i old canon f film body long  long time really like it built like tank  electronic menus  everything run via buttons dials more recently i olympus e zlr   offers much functionality via buttons camera body i used plenty cameras settings buried menus ca n't stand that so camera menuintensive picture mei proverbial `` bull china shop '' careful i  i needed camera would withstand me the d feels solid hefty magnesium shell plastic exterior helps make durable people like me the `` solid '' feeling

blue sky picture  d going blow highlights metered setting i used matrix metering meter scene general  i also used spot meter meter grass  rocks  pavement  etc get approximate  % gray metered value still got blown  overexposed  highlights if i 'm shooting scene grass  rocks  trees  flowers  etc sky  d metered exposure pretty much right on what i found i set +/ exposure setting   cases overexposure possible this brings highlights control i camera set display flashing red color image playback show parts image clipped  seriously overexposed  highlights i histogram enabled  shows three channels  r  g  b  plus luminosity  i see channel   clipping i get flashing highlights image playback so exposure adjustment  usually tames highlightsthe camera also offers active dlighting feature helps bring shadows highlights control enabled i shooting waterfalls mn recently waterfalls shady areas and/or deep gullies  yet sky picture too i underexpose  according meter  keep blowing sky  ie sky get overexposed completely white washed  use either normal high setting active dlighting expose shadows i get nicely balanced exposures i found purposes  active dlighting set low extra high n't help much  low n't increase shadow exposure enough shady areas around waterfalls extra high little much good thinglightroom photoshop not recognize active dlightng raw files all  really  flags raw file tell nikon software adjust exposure curve you still accomplish kind thing photoshop lighroom adjusting curves exposure manually via masking  want jpgs straight camera look good  i think active dlighting  stops exposure adjustment work great i shot waterfalls waterfall bright sunlight sky visible waterfall  rest waterfall ravine rocks area surrounding water deep shadows i still able get nice results using active dlighting increase exposure shadow areasthere also dlighting adjustment playback d  similar active dlighting apply photos already taken  i think works raw files  though   it apply exposure curves like active dlighting postprocess images camera like it processes raw file applies exposure curves saves results jpg  original raw file modified   you also basic processing raw files camera well not good photoshop lightroom pretty good basic adjustmentsthe included software nikon processing photos pretty crummy i 'd recommend using lightroom photoshop elements insteadi wish nikon would display histogram viewfinder i 'm metering rather fact playback that would prevent making many test shots see i got exposure i wanted i n't know anyone industry right now all manufacturers seem find easier display histogram playback reasoni found autofocus sometimes lies low light i taking pictures building night feet away using lens max aperture f the camera would show locked exposure i zoomed picture playback  clearly sharp some pictures i took time focused ok focus i read digital cameras general one particular also get confused low light shooting tell focus lock not the solution problem switch live view mode  disable autofocus camera body lens  zoom lcd manually focus lens get subject sharply focused  click shutter button take picture that worked much better so aware sun gets really low sky actually set behind horizon 's still light left  d autoexposure may work correctly i always check focus exposure playback shooting every image enlarge image lcd playback mode  times  one step short image starts break individual pixels   's easy judge sharpnessyou also postprocess photos  camera  get three varations sepia effect i n't tried yet  want soonoverall  i think great camera it beats previous digital cameras i 've before aware overexposure issue aware autofocus may show locked low light really locked

3904 camera_nikon_d7000 after shooting nikon d little two months  mine arrived mid february   i 'm point i feel comfortable putting together brief review still considering making d purchase i wo n't try duplicate level detail read excellent reviews already posted   many sites   try summarize experiences camera  well provide important information regarding camera i 've primarily shooting nikon mm vr lens  also used nikon f/ mm prime  well so  review focused lenses  useful background read commentsgetting straight nittygritty  leaving extended explanations comments afterwards  based actual use camera  pros+ ability shoot extremely high iso levels little noise  comparatively speaking  makes lowlight shooter 's dream+ sophisticated point focus system+ good overall image quality wide range shooting situations+ good video quality makes many deficiencies previous nikon models+ huge feature set  large number customizable settings surpassed expensive  professional cameras+ excellent construction quality    squeaks and/or loose assembly parts+ large set `` mechanical '' controls  including switches  knobs  assignable buttons allow shoot without required dig menus+ optical

bit heavy  thing wear hours although many report comfortable grip  size camera could smaller  personal taste  however   no articulated display screen  lack really limits video taking  us years used articulated display photography  's real shortcoming  one easy work around   pertains photography  personal taste issue  video  camera shoots quite well  's real shortcoming   liveview still slow

good quality photos low light settings noise levels typically associated cameras shooting  iso in pinch  move iso way   although point noise real factor  still get shots would impossible before but even modestly high iso levels  's  's level  take shots little noise   mind  camera really stands many others  camera uses sony sensor used sony 's slt a camera  may largely account capability  the camera feels tightly built well constructed whether  % magnesium construction underneath  read debate many online postings   camera feels much like professional camera lower cost entry level model the grip design camera make holding unit comfortable  although bit large side  people like large size help hold camera better   in addition  camera physically heavier i would prefer  i find dreading picking times i know weight this  course  multiplied add lens like nikon vr mm i using   point  pretty heavy set but  i say  personal preference  many people considering purchase like understand ahead time  accept  type camera somewhat large somewhat heavyimage quality good the camera capable producing extremely high quality images  given right lens selection right technique i say sentence carefully  really mistake think purchase d kit  based rave reviews  knock one great picture other many  many reviewers  professional lay  confirmed kit lens sold d camera quality  simply exposes shortcomings lens shots this means order take advantage d 's capabilities  really need put good lens it my choice nikon vr ii mm may lens absolute best quality  due compromises zoom lens makes get wide range coverage however  putting prime camera allow camera 's characteristics really shine  even using mm huge step kit  offers wide versatility   but  addition  proper technique must also used achieve optimal results one use working knowledge photographic technique get good images use tripod  even mini one  can always use lens hood  especially shooting outside use fast shutter speeds keep images sharp increase aperture shooting indoors maintain sharpness the camera tends overexpose bright light shooting  reduce exposure / even / outdoor shooting and on the d put great shots  ca n't overlook technique expect rescue every shot without effort you also need experiment normal/vivid settings  greatly affect overall color saturation images according tasteone thing i feel needs mentioned image softness d many reviewers mentioned  arguing softness    exist  experience indeed find d images tend soft side but mean photos bad  unalterable outcome there incamera sharpening applied better still  one shoot raw mode  use software tools post process images  using raw mode also address overexposures sometimes occur bright light situations   even shooting standard jpg format  use image editing software bring thee sharpness quite well but  experience  d tend bit soft  knowing ahead time allow take steps address even shoot first photo of course  budget  putting high quality prime lenses front really move image sharpness upward  often costly route lay photographerin sum  i found nikon d impressive camera represents next step evolution slr technology it would nicer bit smaller lighter  infinitely enjoyable articulated screen employed  things often realm personal taste  thus  fixed determinates one like camera the d knock great photos low light conditions previously

4886 cellphone-sony-xperia sony xperia ugeneral  the sony xperia u entry level android device reasonable price point $   although i find price constantly fluctuating amazon   keep mind  's already clear  small/thin phone using iphone reference  xperia u  display not like iphone 's  in xperia u 's display taller thinner  considerably  'll notice keyboard comes tiny certain icons battery  service bar  general font   still satisfies   keep mind purchasing  i personally like small phones  whole minitv pocket kinda thing   the phones i 've owned past couple years droid pro plus  mytouch g  blackberry curve  mytouch g slide  original iphone this help give reader sense i 'm coming i 'm comparing to i really enjoyed droid pro plus  last phone phone  i sustained little bit water damage hiking trip i figured i 'd try something new i 'm pretty picky  things bother might bother  goes  pros fast a the phone responsive dualcore  ghz processor b very little lag overall using angry birds reference  cuz everyone 's played angry birds  's slight choppiness background enabled game 's perfectly smooth disengaged it 's never really stalled even background enabled  fps dipped bit 's bit noticeable  issues c browsing phone also nice experience  regards speed   i 've browsed cnet  gizmodo  slickdeals  lot stuff pages the pages load pretty quickly  wifi  i 've noticed time bottle neck phone connection  even wifi i 've phones took load pages  scrolling  's slight millisecond lag every scroll  's consistent smooth enough me crisp display a the clarity screen nice  x  pixels   inches  ~ ppi pixel density  b you really ca n't see pixels naked eye dedicated camera button a makes much easier take pictures  's light press  autofocuses  strong press  actually takes picture b the key also allows take picture outside lock screen case need take quick snapshot something n't feel like unlocking device  finding camera app taking picture nice little touch c in opinion  mp camera good enough phone it 's certainly best camera  's far worst it 's average a little noise there swype a this really first time i 've really used swype i n't know changed  i n't like using  device i love it i n't particularly large small hands  phone feels better one hand using  hands  imo so swype really saved  download it front facing camera a honestly  i n't used yet  's nifty feature i n't really phones 's plus me skype taking pictures i guess phone/voice quality a now phone n't really beat droid pro plus blackberry curve loudness clarity voice  's means `` bad '' it 's something keep mind get lost features  forgetting fact device   primarily phone the sound levels peak bit max especially using xloud function enhances loudness speaker but nothing really new surprising since phones i 've owned similar issues app stacking a move app another stacks folder nifty screen protector a comes box  's nicecons texting a now let reader understand  critique texting experience overall  pickiness really shines when adding new contact text  click write new button  indicated pencil + sign  hit add contact  plus sign portrait  type name eventually autopopulate  bar scrolling section below then click name press done my goodness  phone  i press write new  type name would usually autopopulate bar  case i hit enter i 'd done it so rather  motions  takes  motions text new buddy my hope i n't text new people often  luckily thread going  's easier get inbox service bar indicator a i 've never really experienced problem  service bar indicator often inaccurate sometimes i 'm place i know 's service   bars i go ahead test text lo behold  service tricky that gets nerves bit light bar a there builtin way turn light bar off it 's cool  first  minutes  's way adjust brightness turn system luckily  way remedy get app called `` screen filter '' you clickoff enable softkey backlight app settings goes off but app constantly stay notifications bar i 'm bit ocd i love clearing notification bar  unfortunately little screen filter notification always unless i want light bar on battery life a as indicated  battery life n't best  liion  mah what i preserve battery turn live wall paper  dim lights  turn light bar limit number widgets it lasts day half  really  i charge night  battery run middle next day  right   led notification indicator a the led light weak so weak fact  blue indicator seen daylight unless face  cm away it it 's quite useless luckily  's another app fix  sort   light flow lite allows change color led light notifications customizable email  calendar  sms  mms  etc  happen get phone  favor change notification lights red i noticed 's strongest light pierces screen  still dim though let 's put way  're across room / vision 's remote light source room  trust  ca n't see   vibration a vibration weak well maybe i 'm spoiled droid pro plus blackberry curve always strong vibrations i could feel pocket   n't really cut me i 've always relied sound vibration rather sort chime  phone i got ta sound i n't notice texts not huge deal breaker  still kinda bothers me camera a i know i primarily pro  one little thing sorta bugged me when going camera mode outside lockscreen  hold seconds let go the thing  takes picture immediately let go rather going camera mode  allowing actually preview 're taking picture of if good sense 's front screen  good  everytime i 've engaged camera  i 've always first accidental fire legs random wall fixture followed taking real picture just something keep mind sd card a there none  deal space given b not deal breaker i n't generally keep music phone and i always take pictures phone i 've uploaded computer so even though i n't really mind  lack today definitely makes conso little tidbits phone overall phone great phone price  cons n't really outweigh pros me if i could  'd give  rating   rounded cuz def n't deserve  star rating i 've yet try phone really fit everything i wanted  phone many pluses  stuff  ah i 'll
